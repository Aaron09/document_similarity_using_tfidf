comic lifeedit
tragic poets often mocked comic poets dramatic festivals dionysia lenaia euripides travestied aristophanes scripted character least three plays acharnians thesmophoriazusae frogs aristophanes borrowed rather satirized tragedians methods ridiculed colleague cratinus hairsplitting master niceties euripidaristophanist20 according another comic poet teleclides plays euripides coauthored philosopher socrates21 according aristophanes alleged coauthor celebrated actor cephisophon also shared tragedians house wife22 socrates taught entire school quibblers like euripides

dont care whether plays

euripides first competed city dionysia famous athenian dramatic festival year death aeschylus first prize final competition athens bacchae iphigenia aulis performed death first prize awarded posthumously altogether plays first prize five times
plays aeschylus sophocles indicate difference outlook three men—a generation probably sophistical enlightenment middle decades century aeschylus still looked back archaic period sophocles transition periods euripides fully imbued spirit classical age25 euripides plays sequenced time also reveal outlook might changed providing spiritual biography along lines

early period high tragedy medea hippolytus
patriotic period outset peloponnesian children hercules suppliants
middle period disillusionment senselessness hecuba women troy
escapist period focus romantic intrigue iphigenia tauris helen
final period tragic despair orestes phoenician women bacchae

noble families evil first started shameful things seem approved fashionable common people surely think correctthis stands stress life good spirit man37

euripides characters resembled contemporary athenians rather heroic figures myth

hecubao zeus whether necessity nature reason hear prayers everywhere pursuing noiseless path ordering affairs mortals according justice

athenian citizens familiar rhetoric assembly courts scholars believe euripides interested characters speakers cases argue characters lifelike personalities41 selfconscious speaking formally rhetoric shown flawed euripides exploring problematical nature language communication speech points three different directions speaker person addressed features world describes directions felt skewed42 thus example hecuba presents sophisticated intellectual describing rationalized cosmos speech illmatched audience menelaus type unsophisticated listener soon found suit cosmos either infant grandson brutally murdered victorious greeks hippolytus speeches appear verbose ungainly underscore limitations language43
