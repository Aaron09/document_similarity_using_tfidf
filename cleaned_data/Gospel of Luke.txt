lukes theology expressed primarily overarching plot scenes themes characters combine construct specific worldview3 salvation history stretches creation present time readers three ages first time prophets period beginning genesis ending appearance john baptist luke 15–31 second epoch jesus kingdom preached luke 32–2451 finally period church began risen christ taken heaven would second coming28

lukes understanding jesus christology central theology approach titles luke gives jesus include limited christ messiah lord man29 another reading luke context similar grecoroman divine saviour figures roman emperors example references would made clear lukes readers jesus greatest saviours30 third approach luke testament passages jewish scripture cites establish jesus promised messiah31 much familiar much also missing example luke makes clear reference christs preexistence christians union christ makes relatively little reference concept atonement perhaps felt need mention ideas disagreed possibly simply unaware them32
even luke christ ambiguous even contradictory32 example according luke jesus christ birth acts 1037–38 becomes christ resurrection acts seems messiahship active parousia second coming similarly luke saviour birth acts made saviour resurrection born luke 132–35 becomes resurrection according acts 133333 many differences scribal error others deliberate alterations doctrinally unacceptable passages introduction scribes proofs favourite theological tenets34 important example deliberate alterations found lukes account baptism jesus virtually earliest witnesses saying begotten you35 luke taken words psalm ancient royal adoption formula king israel recognised gods elect35 reading theologically difficult implies conferring status jesus previously hold35 unlikely therefore common reading luke says jesus beloved well pleased original35

holy spirit plays important role luke–acts gospels scholars argued spirits involvement career jesus paradigmatic universal christian experience others lukes intention stress jesus uniqueness prophet final age36 clear however luke understands enabling power spirit expressed nondiscriminatory fellowship believed together things common basis christian community37 community also understood kingdom although kingdoms final consummation seen till comes cloud endtime38
