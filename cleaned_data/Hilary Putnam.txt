illustration multiple realizability stands mental stands physical seen instantiate vice versa causal relations states represented arrows goes


putnams bestknown work concerns philosophy mind noted original contributions field came several papers published late 1960s hypothesis multiple realizability37 papers putnam argues contrary famous claim typeidentity theory necessarily true pain identical cfibre firing pain according putnams papers correspond utterly different physical states nervous system different organisms experience mental state pain
putnam cited examples animal kingdom illustrate thesis asked whether likely brain structures diverse types animals realize pain mental states share brain structures cannot share mental states properties answer puzzle mental states realized different physical states different species putnam took argument step asking things nervous systems alien beings artificially intelligent robots siliconbased life forms hypothetical entities contended considered incapable experiencing pain lack neurochemistry humans putnam concluded typeidentity theorists making ambitious highly implausible conjecture could disproven example multiple realizability38 argument sometimes referred likelihood argument37
putnam formulated complementary argument based called functional isomorphism defined concept terms systems functionally isomorphic correspondence states states preserves functional relations case computers machines functionally isomorphic sequential relations among states first exactly mirrored sequential relations among states therefore computer made silicon chips computer made cogs wheels functionally isomorphic constitutionally diverse functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability38 argument sometimes referred priori argument37
jerry fodor putnam others noted along effective argument typeidentity theories multiple realizability implies lowlevel explanation higherlevel mental phenomena insufficiently abstract general383940 functionalism identifies mental kinds functional kinds characterized exclusively terms causes effects abstracts level microphysics therefore seemed better explanation relation mind body fact many functional kinds mousetraps software bookshelves multiply realized physical level38
machine state functionalismedit
first formulation functionalist theory forth putnam formulation called machinestate functionalism inspired analogies noted putnam others mind turing machines point functionalism nature states turing machine state defined terms relations states inputs outputs details accomplishes accomplishes material constitution completely irrelevant according machinestate functionalism nature mental state like nature turing machine state state simply state given particular input suchandsuch happens pain state disposes ouch become distracted wonder cause forth41
rejection functionalismedit
late 1980s putnam abandoned adherence functionalism computational theories mind change mind primarily difficulties computational theories explaining certain intuitions respect externalism mental content illustrated putnams twin earth thought experiment philosophy language14 also developed separate argument functionalism 1988 based fodors generalized version multiple realizability asserting functionalism really watereddown identity theory mental kinds identified functional kinds putnam argued mental kinds multiply realizable functional kinds argument functionalism mental state could implemented different states universal turing machine42
despite putnams rejection functionalism continued flourish developed numerous versions thinkers diverse david marr daniel dennett jerry fodor david lewis43 functionalism helped foundations modern cognitive science43 dominant theory mind philosophy today44
2012 putnam accepted modification functionalism called liberal functionalism view holds matters consciousness mental properties generally right sort functional capacities particular matter subserves capacities15 specification capacities refer goes outside organisms brain include intentional idioms need describe capacity compute something other15
philosophy languageedit
semantic externalismedit
putnams contributions philosophy language claim meaning aint head views meaning first laid meaning reference 1973 meaning meaning 1975 famous twin earth thought experiment illustrate meaning terms determined factors outside mind
twin earth shows according putnam since twin earth everything identical earth except lakes rivers oceans filled whereas earth filled consequently earthling fredrick uses earthenglish word water different meaning twin earthenglish word water used physically identical twin frodrick twin earth since fredrick frodrick physically indistinguishable utter respective words since words different meanings meaning cannot determined solely heads putnam adopt version semantic externalism regard meaning mental content1138 late philosopher mind language donald davidson despite many differences opinion putnam wrote semantic externalism constituted antisubjectivist revolution philosophers seeing world since time descartes philosophers concerned proving knowledge basis subjective experience thanks saul kripke putnam tyler burge others davidson said philosophy could take objective realm granted start questioning alleged truths subjective experience45
theory meaningedit
putnam along saul kripke keith donnellan others contributed known causal theory reference4 particular putnam maintained meaning meaning objects referred natural kind terms—such tiger water tree—are principal elements meaning terms linguistic division labor analogous adam smiths economic division labor according terms references fixed experts particular field science terms belong example reference term lion fixed community zoologists reference term tree fixed community botanists reference term table salt fixed nacl chemists referents considered rigid designators kripkean sense disseminated outward linguistic community38
putnam specifies finite sequence elements vector description meaning every term language vector consists four components

object term refers object individuated chemical formula
typical descriptions term referred stereotype transparent colorless hydrating
semantic indicators place object general category natural kind liquid
syntactic indicators concrete noun mass noun

meaningvector provides description reference expression within particular linguistic community provides conditions correct usage makes possible judge whether single speaker attributes appropriate meaning expression whether changed enough cause difference meaning according putnam legitimate speak change meaning expression reference term stereotype changed however since possible algorithm determine aspect—the stereotype reference—has changed particular case necessary consider usage expressions language38 since limit number expressions must considered putnam embraced form semantic holism46
philosophy mathematicsedit
putnam made significant contribution philosophy mathematics quine–putnam indispensability argument mathematical realism47 argument considered stephen yablo challenging arguments favor acceptance existence abstract mathematical entities numbers sets48 form argument follows

epistemologyedit




brain vat—putnam uses thought experiment argue skeptical scenarios impossible


field epistemology putnam known brain thought experiment modernized version descartes evil demon hypothesis argument cannot coherently state disembodied brain placed scientist11
follows causal theory reference words always refer kinds things coined refer thus kinds things user users ancestors experienced person mary brain whose every experience received wiring gadgetry created scientist marys idea brain would refer real brain since linguistic community never seen thing rather something looked like brain actually image wiring similarly idea would refer real brain brain would actually saying brainimage vatimage incoherent hand brain saying brain still incoherent actually means opposite form epistemological externalism knowledge justification depends factors outside mind solely determined internally11
putnam clarified real target argument never skepticism metaphysical realism55 since realism kind assumes existence conceives world world really skeptical scenarios descartes evil demon present formidable challenge putnam arguing scenario impossible attempts show notion mans concept world absurd cannot gods view reality limited conceptual schemes metaphysical realism therefore false according putnam56
metaphilosophy ontologyedit
late 1970s 1980s stimulated results mathematical logic ideas quine putnam abandoned longstanding defence metaphysical realism—the view categories structures external world causally ontologically independent conceptualizations human mind adopted rather different view called internal realism1257
internal realism view although world causally independent human mind structure world—its division kinds individuals categories—is function human mind hence world ontologically independent general idea influenced kants idea dependence knowledge world categories thought58
problem metaphysical realism according putnam fails explain possibility reference truth according metaphysical realist concepts categories refer match mysterious manner prestructured categories kinds individuals inherent external world possible world carves certain structures categories mind carves world categories structures carvings perfectly coincide answer must world come prestructured structure must imposed human mind conceptual schemes reason truth history putnam identified truth termed idealized rational acceptability theory owes something peirce belief true would accepted anyone ideal epistemic conditions12
nelson goodman formulated similar notion fact fiction forecast 1956 work goodman went suggest world many worlds created human mind59 putnam rejected form social constructivism retained idea many correct descriptions reality descriptions scientifically proven true description world imply relativism putnam descriptions equally correct ones correct determined subjectively60
putnam renounced internal realism reply simon blackburn volume reading putnam61 reasons gave antirealism stated first three replies philosophy hilary putnam issue journal philosophical topics gives history uses term internal realism length threefold cord mind body world 199962
although abandoned internal realism putnam still resists idea given thing system things described exactly complete correct thus accepts conceptual relativity view matter choice convention whether mereological sums exist whether spacetime points individuals mere limits words abandoned internal realism putnam came accept metaphysical realism simply broad sense rejecting forms verificationism talk making world63
influence peirce william james putnam also became convinced fact–value dichotomy normative ethical aesthetic judgments often factual basis scientific judgments normative element60
neopragmatism wittgensteinedit
1980s putnam became increasingly disillusioned perceived scientism rejection history characterize modern analytic philosophy rejected internal realism assumed cognitive interface model relation mind world putnam claimed notion truth would abandoned consistent eliminative materialist64 increasing influence james pragmatists adopted direct realist view relation time influence ludwig wittgenstein adopted pluralist view philosophy came view philosophical problems nothing conceptual linguistic confusions created philosophers using ordinary language original context60 2017 book collecting articles pragmatism ruth anna hilary putnam published pragmatism life lasting legacy william james john dewey harvard 2017 isbn 9780674967502
many putnams recent works addressed concerns ordinary people particularly concerns social problems65 example written nature democracy social justice religion discussed ideas continental philosopher jürgen habermas written articles influenced continental ideas20

criticismedit
putnam formidable philosophical adversary8 frequent changes mind attack previous positions however many significant criticisms views come philosophers scientists example multiple realizability criticized grounds true research experimentation neurosciences would impossible68 according william bechtel jennifer mundale able conduct research neurosciences universal consistencies must either exist assumed exist brain structures similarity homology brain structures allows generalize across species68 multiple realizability empirical fact results experiments conducted species animal organism would meaningful generalized explain behavior another species organism species69 criticisms metaphysical realism proposed jaegwon david lewis robert richardson patricia churchland70717273
main arguments functionalism formulated putnam twin earth thought experiment however criticisms chinese room argument john searle 1980 direct attack claim thought represented functions thought experiment designed show possible mimic intelligent action without interpretation understanding purely functional system short searle describes situation person speaks english locked room chinese symbols baskets rule book english moving symbols around person instructed people outside room follow rule book sending certain symbols room given certain symbols suppose people outside room chinese speakers communicating person inside chinese symbols according searle would absurd claim english speaker inside knows chinese based syntactic processes alone thought experiment attempts show systems operate merely syntactic processes cannot realize semantics meaning intentionality aboutness thus searle attacks idea thought equated following syntactic rules thus functionalism inadequate theory mind74 several arguments functionalism advanced block75
putnam consistently adhered idea semantic holism spite many changes positions problems position described michael dummett jerry fodor ernest lepore others first place suggest semantic holism true impossible understand speaker language learn meaning expression expression language given limits cognitive abilities never able master whole english language even based false assumption languages static immutable entities thus must understand natural language understand single word expression language learning simply impossible semantic holism also fails explain speakers mean thing using linguistic expression therefore communication possible given sentence since fred mary mastered different parts english language related different ways sentences part result means thing fred something else mary moreover sentence derives meaning relations sentences language soon vocabulary individual changes addition elimination sentence totality relations changes therefore also meaning common phenomenon result different meanings different moments life person consequently accept truth sentence reject later meaning rejected accepted completely different therefore cannot change opinions regard sentences767778
brain argument also subject criticism79 crispin wright argues putnams formulation braininavat scenario narrow refute global skepticism possibility recently disembodied brain undermined semantic externalism person lived entire life outside vat—speaking english language interacting normally outside world—prior envatment scientist wakes inside words thoughts tree grass still refer objects events external world referred envatment55 another scenario brain hooked supercomputer randomly generates perceptual experiences case ones words thoughts would refer anything would therefore devoid content semantics would longer exist argument would meaningless80
philosophy mathematics stephen yablo argued quine–putnam indispensability thesis demonstrate mathematical entities truly indispensable argumentation sophisticated upshot achieve logical results simply adding statement abstract object assumption soandso assumed hypothesized exist example take argument indispensability described adjust follows

must ontological commitments abstract entities assumption exist existence indispensable best scientific theories
assumption exist existence mathematical entities indispensable best scientific theories therefore
assumption mathematical entities exist must ontological commitments existence mathematical entities48

finally putnams internal realism accused curtis brown disguised form subjective idealism case subject traditional arguments position particular falls trap solipsism existence depends experience subjective idealism maintains ones consciousness stop existing rest universe would stop existing well58
