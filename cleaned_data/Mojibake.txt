causesedit
correctly reproduce original text encoded correspondence encoded data notion encoding must preserved mojibake instance incompliance achieved manipulating data relabeling
mojibake often seen text data tagged wrong encoding even tagged moved computers different default encodings major source trouble communication protocols rely settings computer rather sending storing metadata together data
differing default settings computers part differing deployments unicode among operating system families partly legacy encodings specializations different writing systems human languages whereas linux distributions mostly switched utf8 around 2004citation needed uses text microsoft windows still uses codepages text files differ languages
writing systems example japanese several encodings historically employed causing users mojibake relatively often japanese example word mojibake 文字化け stored eucjp might incorrectly displayed ﾊｸｻ�ｽ､ｱ ﾊｸｻ嵂ｽ､ｱ ms932 ﾊｸｻ郾ｽ､ｱ shiftjis2004 interpreted form shift text stored utf8 displayed 譁�蟄怜喧縺� interpreted shift exacerbated locales involved utf8 text appears æ–‡å—åœ–ã‘ software assumes text windows1252 iso88591 encodings usually labelled western example 鏂囧瓧鍖栥亼 interpreted mainland china locale
underspecificationedit
encoding specified software decide means depending type software typical solution either configuration charset detection heuristics prone mispredict notsouncommon scenarios
encoding text files usually governed oslevel setting depends brand operating system possibly users language therefore assumed encoding systematically wrong files come computer different setting example transferring files windows linux solution byte order mark source code machine readable text many parsers dont tolerate another storing encoding metadata filesystem filesystems support extended file attributes store usercharset2 also requires support software wants take advantage disturb software
encodings easy detect particular utf8 many hard distinguish charset detection browser able distinguish page coded eucjp another shiftjis coding scheme assigned explicitly using http headers sent along documents using html documents meta tags used substitute missing http headers server cannot configured send proper http headers character encodings html
misspecificationedit
mojibake also occurs encoding wrongly specified often happens encodings similar example eudora email client windows known send emails labelled iso88591 reality windows12523 version eudora exhibit behaviour windows1252 contains extra printable characters range frequently seen typographically correct quotation marks dashes displayed properly software complying standard especially affected software running operating systems unix
human ignoranceedit
encodings still many partially compatible ascii predominant common subset sets stage human ignorance

compatibility deceptive property common subset characters unaffected mixup encodings problems different writing systems
people think using ascii tend label whatever superset ascii actually ascii maybe simplification even academic literature word ascii found used example something compatible unicode evidently ascii windows1252 unicode utf81 note utf8 backwards compatible ascii

overspecificationedit
layers protocols trying specify encoding based different information least certain information misleading recipient example consider server serving static html file http character communicated client number ways

http header information based server configuration instance serving file disk controlled application running server dynamic websites
file html meta httpequiv charset encoding attribute declaration encoding author meant save particular file
file byte order mark encoding authors editor actually saved unless accidental encoding conversion happened opening encoding saving another correct however available unicode encodings utf8 utf16

lack hardwaresoftware supportedit
many older hardware typically designed support character character typically cannot altered character table contained within display firmware localized characters country device sold typically table differs country country systems potentially display mojibake loading text generated system different country likewise many early operating systems support multiple encoding formats thus displaying mojibake made display nonstandard text early versions microsoft windows palm example localized percountry basis support encoding standards relevant country localized version sold display mojibake file containing text different encoding format version designed support opened
resolutionsedit
applications using utf8 default encoding achieve greater degree interoperability widespread backward compatibility usascii utf8 also ability directly recognised simple algorithm well written software able avoid mixing utf8 encodings
difficulty resolving instance mojibake varies depending application within occurs causes common applications mojibake occur browsers word processors modern browsers word processors often support wide array character encodings browsers often allow user change rendering engines encoding setting word processors allow user select appropriate encoding opening file take trial error users find correct encoding
problem gets complicated occurs application normally support wide range character encoding nonunicode computer game case user must change operating systems encoding settings match game however changing systemwide encoding settings also cause mojibake preexisting applications windows later user also option microsoft applocale application allows changing perapplication locale settings even changing operating system encoding settings possible earlier operating systems windows resolve issue earlier operating systems user would third party font rendering applications
problems different writing systemsedit
englishedit
mojibake english texts generally occurs punctuation dashes dashes curly quotes “”‘’ rarely character text since encodings agree ascii encoding english alphabet example pound sign appear encoded sender utf8 interpreted recipient cp1252 88591 iterated lead ã‚â£ ãƒâ€šã‚â£ ãƒæ’ã¢â‚¬å¡ãƒâ€šã‚â£
computers older eras vendorspecific encodings caused mismatch also english text commodore brand 8bit computers used petscii encoding particularly notable inverting upper lower case compared standard ascii petscii printers worked fine computers flipped case letters mainframes ebcdic encoding match ascii
central europeanedit

russian cyrillic alphabets edit
mojibake colloquially called krakozyabry кракозя́бры ipakrɐkɐˈzʲæbrɪ̈ russian remains complicated several systems encoding cyrillic4 soviet union early russian federation developed encodings obmena informaciej обмена информацией translates code information exchange began cyrilliconly 7bit koi7 based ascii latin characters replaced cyrillic letters came 8bit koi8 encoding ascii extension encodes cyrillic letters highbit octets corresponding 7bit codes koi7 reason koi8 text even russian remains partially readable stripping eighth considered major advantage 8bitmimeunaware email systems example words школа русского языка shkola russkogo yazyka encoded koi8 passed high stripping process rendered kola russkogo qzyka eventually koi8 gained different flavors russianbulgarian koi8r ukrainian koi8u belarusian koi8ru even tajik koi8t
meanwhile west code page supported ukrainian belarusian well russianbulgarian msdos microsoft windows code page 1251 added support serbian slavic variants cyrillic
recently unicode encoding includes code points practically characters worlds languages including cyrillic characters
unicode necessary match text encoding font using encoding system failure produced unreadable gibberish whose specific appearance varied depending exact combination text encoding font encoding example attempting view nonunicode cyrillic text using font limited latin alphabet using default western encoding typically results text consists almost entirely vowels diacritical marks koi8 библиотека biblioteka library becomes âéâìéïôåëá using win1251 view text koi8 vice versa results garbled text consists mostly capital letters koi8 win1251 share ascii region koi8 uppercase letters region win1251 lowercase vice versa general cyrillic gibberish symptomatic using wrong cyrillic font early years russian sector world wide koi8 win1251 common 2017 still encounter html pages win1251 rarely koi8 encodings well unicode estimated pages worldwide languages included encoded win12515 though html standard includes ability specify encoding given page source6 sometimes neglected forcing user switch encodings browser manually
bulgarian mojibake often called majmunica маймуница meaning monkeys alphabet serbian called đubre ђубре meaning trash unlike former ussr south slavs never used something like koi8 code page 1251 dominant cyrillic encoding unicode therefore languages experienced fewer encoding incompatibility troubles russian 1980s bulgarian computers used encoding superficially similar although incompatible cp866
