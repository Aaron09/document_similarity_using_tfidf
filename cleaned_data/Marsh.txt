many kinds birds nest marshes yellowheaded blackbird


marshes provide habitat many species plants animals insects adapted living flooded conditions1 plants must able survive oxygen levels many plants therefore aerenchyma channels within stem allow move leaves rooting zone1 marsh plants also tend rhizomes underground storage reproduction familiar examples include cattails sedges papyrus sawgrass aquatic animals fish salamanders generally able live amount oxygen water obtain oxygen instead others live indefinitely conditions oxygen3 marshes provide habitats many kinds invertebrates fish amphibians waterfowl aquatic mammals4 marshes extremely high levels biological production highest world therefore important supporting fisheries1 marshes also improve water quality acting sink filter pollutants sediment water flows marshes wetlands able absorb water periods heavy rainfall slowly release waterways therefore reduce magnitude flooding5 marshes tends neutral alkaline opposed bogs peat accumulates acid conditions

salt marsh scotland


marshes differ depending mainly location salinity factors greatly influence range scope animal plant life survive reproduce environments three main types marsh salt marshes freshwater tidal marshes freshwater marshes3 three found worldwide contains different organisms
salt marshesedit
main article salt marsh
saltwater marshes found around world high latitudes wherever sections protected coastline located close enough shoreline motion tides affects sporadically covered water flourish rate sediment buildup greater rate land level sinking3 salt marshes dominated specially adapted rooted vegetation primarily salttolerant grasses6
salt marshes commonly found lagoons estuaries sheltered side shingle sandspit currents carry fine particles around quiet side spit sediment begins build locations allow marshes absorb excess nutrients water running reach oceans estuaries3 marshes slowly declining coastal development urban sprawl caused significant loss essential habitats7
freshwater tidal marshesedit
although considered freshwater marsh form marsh affected ocean tides however without stresses salinity work saltwater counterpart diversity plants animals live freshwater tidal marshes much higher salt marshes serious threats form marsh increasing size pollution cities surrounding them3
freshwater marshesedit
main articles meadow vernal pool lake




meadow adjacent bear lake bernardino mountains california


ranging greatly size geographic location freshwater marshes make common form wetland north america also diverse three types marsh examples freshwater marsh types north america
meadowsedit
meadows occur areas shallow lake basins lowlying depressions land shallow marshes upland areas also occur edges large lakes rivers meadows often high plant diversity high densities buried seeds68 regularly flooded often summer
vernal poolsedit
vernal pools type marsh found seasonally shallow depressions land covered shallow water summer fall completely western north america vernal pools tend form open grasslands9 whereas east often occur forested landscapes10 south vernal pools form pine savannas flatwoods many amphibian species depend upon vernal pools spring breeding ponds provide habitat free fish eggs young amphibians6 example endangered gopher frog rana sevosa11 similar temporary ponds occur world ecosystems local names however term vernal pool applied temporary pool ecosystems6
playa lakesedit
playa lakes form shallow freshwater marsh occurs southern high plains united states12 like vernal pools present certain times year generally circular shape13 playa dries summer conspicuous plant zonation develops along shoreline14
prairie potholesedit




aerial view prairie potholes


prairie potholes found northern parts north america prairie pothole region landscapes covered glaciers result shallow depressions formed great numbers depressions fill water spring provide important breeding habitats many species waterfowl pools occur seasonally others retain enough water present year15
riverine wetlandsedit
many kinds marsh occur along fringes large rivers different types produced factors water level nutrients scour waves16
restorationedit
areas world already lost wetlands including marshes drained create agricultural land filled accommodate urban sprawl restoration process returning marshes landscape replace lost past1 restoration done large scale allowing rivers flood naturally spring small scale returning wetlands urban landscapes
