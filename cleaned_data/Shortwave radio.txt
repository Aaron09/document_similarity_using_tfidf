shortwave communications began grow rapidly 1920s9 similar internet late 20th century 1928 half long distance communications moved transoceanic cables longwave wireless services shortwave overall volume transoceanic shortwave communications vastly increased shortwave also ended need multimilliondollar investments massive longwave wireless stationscitation needed although commercial longwave communications stations remained 1960s long distance radio circuits also reduced load existing transoceanic telegraph cables hence need cables although cables maintained advantages high security much reliable better quality signal shortwave
cable companies began lose large sums money 1927 serious financial crisis threatened viability cable companies vital strategic british interests british government convened imperial wireless cable conference10 1928 examine situation arisen result competition beam wireless cable services recommended received government approval overseas cable wireless resources empire merged system controlled newly formed company 1929 imperial international communications name company changed cable wireless 1934

amateur shortwave propagationedit
amateur radio operators also discovered longdistance communication possible shortwave bands early longdistance services used surface wave propagation frequencies11 attenuated along path wavelengths shorter 1000 meters longer distances higher frequencies using method meant signal loss difficulties generating detecting higher frequencies made discovery shortwave propagation difficult commercial services

solidstate analog shortwave receiver


several different types modulation used impress information shortwave transmission
amplitude modulation simplest type commonly used shortwave broadcasting instantaneous amplitude carrier controlled amplitude signal speech music example receiver simple detector recovers desired modulation signal carrier
single sideband transmission form amplitude modulation effect filters result modulation amplitudemodulated signal frequency components carrier frequency components eliminated well residual carrier remaining transmitted saves power transmission roughly energy sent signal unnecessary recover information contained also saves bandwidth allowing onehalf carrier frequency spacing used drawback receiver complicated since must rerecreate carrier recover signal small errors detector process greatly affect pitch received signal single side band usual music general broadcast single side band used longrange voice communications ships aircraft citizens band amateur radio operators lower sideband generally used upper sideband
vestigal sideband transmits carrier complete sideband filters redundant sideband compromise allowing simple receivers used requiring almost much transmitter power advantage half bandwidth signal used heard transmission certain radio time signal stations vestigial sideband used television broadcasts analog digital

advantagesedit
shortwave possess number advantages newer technologies including following

difficulty censoring programming authorities restrictive countries unlike relative ease monitoring internet government authorities face technical difficulties monitoring stations sites listened accessed example attempted coup soviet president mikhail gorbachev access communications limited phones gorbachev able stay informed means world service shortwave24
lowcost shortwave radios widely available repressive countries world simple shortwave regenerative receivers easily built parts
many countries particularly developing nations eastern bloc cold ownership shortwave receivers continues widespread25 many countries domestic stations also used shortwave
many newer shortwave receivers portable batteryoperated making useful difficult circumstances newer technology includes handcranked radios provide power without batteries
shortwave radios used situations internet satellite communications service temporarily longterm unavailable unaffordable
shortwave radio travels much farther broadcast 88–108 shortwave broadcasts easily transmitted distance several thousands kilometers including continent another
particularly tropical regions somewhat less prone interference thunderstorms medium wave radio able cover large geographic area relatively power hence cost therefore many countries widely used domestic broadcasting
little infrastructure required longdistance twoway communications using shortwave radio needs pair transceivers antenna source energy battery portable generator electrical grid makes shortwave radio robust means communications disrupted interference ionospheric conditions modern digital transmission modes mfsk olivia even robust allowing successful reception signals well noise floor conventional receiver

disadvantagesedit
shortwave radios benefits sometimes regarded outweighed drawbacks including

western countries shortwave radio ownership usually limited true enthusiasts since standard radios receive shortwave band therefore western audiences limited
developed world shortwave reception difficult urban areas excessive noise switchedmode power adapters fluorescent light sources internet modems routers computers many sources radio interference
