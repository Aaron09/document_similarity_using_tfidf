world health organization recommends focusing prevention preparedness response combat spread cholera31 also stress importance effective surveillance system31 governments play role areas
although cholera lifethreatening prevention disease normally straightforward proper sanitation practices followed developed countries nearly universal advanced water treatment sanitation practices present cholera rare example last major outbreak cholera united states occurred 1910–19113233 cholera mainly risk developing countries
effective sanitation practices instituted adhered time usually sufficient stop epidemic several points along cholera transmission path spread haltedcitation needed

sterilization proper disposal treatment materials come contact cholera victims feces clothing bedding essential sanitized washing water using chlorine bleach possible hands touch cholera patients clothing bedding thoroughly cleaned disinfected chlorinated water effective antimicrobial agents
sewage fecal sludge management choleraaffected areas sewage fecal sludge need treated managed carefully order stop spread disease human excreta provision sanitation hygiene important preventative measure31 open defecation release untreated sewage dumping fecal sludge latrines septic tanks environment need prevented34 many cholera affected zones degree sewage treatment3536 therefore implementation toilets contribute water pollution flush water interesting alternative flush toilets37
sources warnings possible cholera contamination posted around contaminated water sources directions decontaminate water boiling chlorination possible
water purification water used drinking washing cooking sterilized either boiling chlorination ozone water treatment ultraviolet light sterilization solar water disinfection antimicrobial filtration area cholera present chlorination boiling often least expensive effective means halting transmission cloth filters sari filtration though basic significantly reduced occurrence cholera used poor villages bangladesh rely untreated surface water better antimicrobial filters like present advanced individual water treatment hiking kits effective public health education adherence appropriate sanitation practices primary importance help prevent control transmission cholera diseases

handwashing soap using toilet handling food eating also recommended cholera prevention africa38
surveillance
surveillance prompt reporting allow containing cholera epidemics rapidly cholera exists seasonal disease many endemic countries occurring annually mostly rainy seasons surveillance systems provide early alerts outbreaks therefore leading coordinated response assist preparation preparedness plans efficient surveillance systems also improve risk assessment potential cholera outbreaks understanding seasonality location outbreaks provides guidance improving cholera control activities vulnerable39 prevention effective important cases reported national health authorities12
vaccine

preventive inoculation cholera 1966


number safe effective oral vaccines cholera available40 world health organization three prequalified oral cholera vaccines ocvs dukoral sanchol euvichol dukoral orally administered inactivated whole cell vaccine overall efficacy first year given second year minimal side effects40 available countries however currentlywhen recommended centers disease control prevention people traveling united states endemic countries41 vaccine recommends vaxchora oral attenuated live vaccine effective single dose42
injectable vaccine found effective three years protective efficacy lower children less years old43 however 2010 limited availability1 work investigate role mass vaccination44 world health organization recommends immunization highrisk groups children people countries disease endemic1 people immunized broadly herd immunity results decrease amount contamination environment27
sari filtration
effective relatively cheap method prevent transmission cholera folded sari long cloth garment filter drinking water45 bangladesh practice found decrease rates cholera nearly half46 involves folding sari four eight times45 uses cloth rinsed clean water dried kill bacteria it47 nylon cloth appears work well affordable46
treatment




cholera patient treated oral rehydration therapy 1992


continued eating speeds recovery normal intestinal function world health organization recommends generally cases diarrhea matter underlying cause48 training manual specifically cholera states continue breastfeed baby baby watery diarrhea even traveling treatment adults older children continue frequently49
fluids
common error caring patients cholera underestimate speed volume fluids required50 cases cholera successfully treated oral rehydration therapy highly effective safe simple administer27 ricebased solutions preferred glucosebased ones greater efficiency27 severe cases significant dehydration intravenous rehydration necessary ringers lactate preferred solution often added potassium1248 large volumes continued replacement diarrhea subsided needed12 percent persons body weight fluid need given first four hours12 method first tried mass scale bangladesh liberation found much success51 despite widespread beliefs fruit juices commercial fizzy drinks like cola ideal rehydration people serious infections intestines excessive sugar content even harm water uptake52
commercially produced oral rehydration solutions expensive difficult obtain solutions made recipe calls liter boiled water teaspoon salt teaspoons sugar added mashed banana potassium improve taste53
electrolytes
frequently initially acidosis potassium level normal even though large losses occurred12 dehydration corrected potassium levels decrease rapidly thus need replaced12 done consuming foods high potassium like bananas coconut water54
antibiotics
antibiotic treatments three days shorten course disease reduce severity symptoms12 antibiotics also reduces fluid requirements55 people recover without however sufficient hydration maintained27 world health organization recommends antibiotics severe dehydration54
doxycycline typically used first line although strains cholerae shown resistance12 testing resistance outbreak help determine appropriate future choices12 antibiotics proven effective include cotrimoxazole erythromycin tetracycline chloramphenicol furazolidone56 fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin also used resistance reported57
antibiotics improve outcomes severely severely dehydrated58 azithromycin tetracycline work better doxycycline ciprofloxacin58
zinc supplementation
bangladesh zinc supplementation reduced duration severity diarrhea children cholera given antibiotics rehydration therapy needed reduced length disease eight hours amount diarrhea stool 1059 supplementation appears also effective treating preventing infectious diarrhea causes among children developing world5960
prognosis
people cholera treated quickly properly mortality rate less however untreated cholera mortality rate rises 50–601261
certain genetic strains cholera present 2010 epidemic haiti 2004 outbreak india death occur within hours becoming ill62

society culture
health policy
many developing countries cholera still reaches victims contaminated water sources countries without proper sanitation techniques greater incidence disease92 governments play role 2008 example zimbabwean cholera outbreak partly governments role according report james baker institute17 haitian governments inability provide safe drinking water 2010 earthquake increase cholera cases well93
similarly south africas cholera outbreak exacerbated governments policy privatizing water programs wealthy elite country able afford safe water others water cholerainfected riversnot citation given94
according rita colwell james baker institute cholera begin spread government preparedness crucial governments ability contain disease extends areas prevent high death toll development epidemic even pandemic effective disease surveillance ensure cholera outbreaks recognized soon possible dealt appropriately oftentimes allow public health programs determine control cause cases whether unsanitary water seafood accumulated vibrio cholerae specimens17 effective surveillance program contributes governments ability prevent cholera spreading year 2000 state kerala india kottayam district determined choleraaffected pronouncement task forces concentrated educating citizens 13670 information sessions human health95 task forces promoted boiling water obtain safe water provided chlorine oral rehydration salts95 ultimately helped control spread disease areas minimize deaths hand researchers shown citizens infected 1991 cholera outbreak bangladesh lived rural areas recognized governments surveillance program inhibited physicians abilities detect cholera cases early96
according colwell quality inclusiveness countrys health care system affects control cholera zimbabwean cholera outbreak17 sanitation practices important governments respond quickly readily available vaccines country lower cholera death toll affordability vaccines problem governments provide vaccinations wealthy able afford greater toll countrys poor9798 speed government leaders respond cholera outbreaks important99
