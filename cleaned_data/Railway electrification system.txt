railway electrification system supplies electric power railway trains trams without onboard prime mover local fuel supply electric railways electric locomotives haul passengers freight separate cars electric multiple units passenger cars motors electricity typically generated large relatively efficient generating stations transmitted railway network distributed trains electric railways dedicated generating stations transmission lines purchase power electric utility railway usually provides distribution lines switches transformers
power supplied moving trains nearly continuous conductor running along track usually takes forms overhead line suspended poles towers along track structure tunnel ceilings third rail mounted track level contacted sliding pickup shoe overhead wire thirdrail systems usually running rails return conductor systems separate fourth rail purpose
comparison principal alternative diesel engine electric railways offer substantially better energy efficiency lower emissions lower operating costs electric locomotives also usually quieter powerful responsive reliable diesels local emissions important advantage tunnels urban areas electric traction systems provide regenerative braking turns trains kinetic energy back electricity returns supply system used trains general utility grid diesel locomotives burn petroleum electricity generated diverse sources including renewable energy
disadvantages electric traction include high capital costs uneconomic lightly trafficked routes relative lack flexibility since electric trains need electrified tracks overhead wires vulnerability power interruptions different regions different supply voltages frequencies complicating service requiring greater complexity locomotive power limited clearances available overhead lines preclude efficient doublestack container service
railway electrification constantly increased past decades 2012 electrified tracks account nearly third total tracks globally1
