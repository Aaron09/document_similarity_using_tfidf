overuse injuriesedit
study cyclists large majority reported least overuse injury third requiring medical treatment common injury sites neck knees well groinbuttocks hands back women likely suffer neck shoulder pain men53
many cyclists suffer overuse injuries knees affecting cyclists levels caused many factors54

incorrect bicycle adjustment particularly saddle
incorrect adjustment clipless pedals
many hills many miles early training season
poor training preparation long touring rides
selecting high gear lower gear uphill climb protects knees even though muscles well able handle higher gear

excessive saddle height cause posterior knee pain setting saddle cause pain anterior knee incorrectly fitted saddle eventually lead muscle imbalance degree knee angle recommended avoid overuse injury55
overuse injuries including chronic nerve damage weight bearing locations occur result repeatedly riding bicycle extended periods time damage ulnar nerve palm carpal tunnel wrist genitourinary tract56 bicycle seat neuropathy57 result overuse recumbent bicycles designed different ergonomic principles eliminate pressure saddle handlebars relaxed riding position
note overuse relative term capacity varies greatly individuals someone starting cycling must careful increase length frequency cycling sessions slowly starting example hour hundred miles kilometers week bilateral muscular pain normal byproduct training process whereas unilateral pain reveal exerciseinduced arterial endofibrosis58 joint pain numbness also early signs overuse injury
