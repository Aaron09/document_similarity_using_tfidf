magnetostratigraphyedit
main article magnetostratigraphy
magnetostratigraphy chronostratigraphic technique used date sedimentary volcanic sequences method works collecting oriented samples measured intervals throughout section samples analyzed determine detrital remanent magnetism polarity earths magnetic field time stratum deposited sedimentary rocks possible finegrained magnetic minerals behave like tiny compasses fall water column orient earths magnetic field upon burial orientation preserved volcanic rocks magnetic minerals form melt orient ambient magnetic field fixed place upon crystallization lava
oriented paleomagnetic core samples collected field mudstones siltstones finegrained sandstones preferred lithologies magnetic grains finer likely orient ambient field deposition ancient magnetic field oriented similar todays field north magnetic pole near north rotational pole strata would retain normal polarity data indicate north magnetic pole near south rotational pole strata would exhibit reversed polarity
results individual samples analyzed removing natural remanent magnetization reveal following statistical analysis results used generate local magnetostratigraphic column compared global magnetic polarity time scale
technique used date sequences generally lack fossils interbedded igneous rocks continuous nature sampling means also powerful technique estimation sedimentaccumulation rates
