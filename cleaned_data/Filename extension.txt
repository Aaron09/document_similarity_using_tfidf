usageedit
filename extensions considered type metadata1 commonly used imply information data might stored file exact definition giving criteria deciding part file name extension belongs rules specific filesystem used usually extension substring follows last occurrence character example extension filename readmetxt html extension mysiteindexhtml file systems mainframe systems systems derivative systems msdos extension separate namespace filename microsofts windows extensions indicate file program executable os360 successors part dataset name following last period treated extension software edit special significance operating system applies unix files
filesystems unixlike operating systems separate extension metadata rest file name character another character main filename filenames multiple extensions usually representing nested transformations filestargz indicates file archive files indicates archive file compressed gzip programs transforming creating files appropriate extension names inferred input file names unless explicitly given output file name programs reading files usually ignore information mostly intended human user common especially binary files file contain internal metadata describing contents model generally requires full filename provided commands whereas metadata approach often allows extension omitted
vfat ntfs refs file systems windows also separate extension metadata rest file name allow multiple extensions
advent graphical user interfaces issue file management interface behavior arose microsoft windows allowed multiple applications associated given extension different actions available selecting required application context menu offering choice viewing editing printing file assumption still extension represented single file type unambiguous mapping extension icon
classic disposed filenamebased extension metadata entirely used instead distinct file type code identify file format additionally creator code specified determine application would launched files icon doubleclicked macos however uses filename suffixes well type creator codes consequence derived unixlike nextstep operating system

filename extension originally used easily determine files generic typecitation needed need condense files type three characters frequently abbreviated extensions examples include using graphics files plain text music however many different software programs made handle data types others variety ways filename extensions started become closely associated certain products—even specific product versions example early wordstar files used programs version number also filename extensions began conflict separate files example used package manager packages realplayer media files2 others shared desqview fonts quicken financial ledgers quicktime pictures3 shared grabit scripts game advance images and4sb used smallbasic scratch
operating systems multics used filename extensions generally much liberal sizes filenames many allowed full filename lengths characters maximum name lengths uncommon file systems operating systems unix stored file name single string split base name extension components another character allowed file names systems generally allow variablelength filenames permitting hence multiple suffixes components multics unix applications running used suffixes cases indicate file types much—for example executables ordinary text files suffixes names
highperformance file system hpfs used microsoft ibms also supported long file names divide file name name extension convention using suffixes continued even though hpfs supported extended attributes files allowing files type stored file extended attribute
microsofts windows native file system ntfs supported long file names divide file name name extension convention using suffixes simulate extensions continued compatibility existing versions windows
internet first arrived using windows systems still restricted filename formats create pages names ending using macintosh unix computers could recommended html filename extension also became problem programmers experimenting java programming language since requires source code files fourletter suffix java compiles object code output files fiveletter class suffix5
eventually windows introduced support long file names removed nameextension split file names nonnt windows extended version commonly used file system called vfat vfat first appeared windows windows internal implementation long file names vfat largely considered kludge removed important length restriction allowed files upper case lower case letters machines would windows well however threecharacter extensions microsoft windows continued originally backward compatibility older versions windows habit along problems creates

filename extension command name appears occasionally usually side effect command implemented script bourne shell python interpreter name suffixed command name practice common systems rely associations filename extension interpreter sharply deprecated6 unixderived systems like linux apples macos interpreter normally specified header script shebang
associationbased systems filename extension generally mapped single systemwide selection interpreter extension meaning python command runnable command line even extension omitted assuming appropriate setup done implementation language changed command name extension changed well provides consistent allowing extensionless version command used cases method suffers somewhat essentially global nature association mapping well developers incomplete avoidance extensions calling programs developers cant force avoidance windows remaining widespread employer mechanism
systems interpreter directives including virtually versions unix command name extensions special significance standard practice used since primary method interpreters scripts start single line specifying interpreter could viewed degenerate resource fork environments including extension command name unnecessarily exposes implementation detail puts references commands programs future risk implementation changes example would perfectly normal shell script reimplemented python ruby later would change name command extensions used without extensions program always extensionless name interpreter directive andor magic number changing references program programs remain valid
security issuesedit
default behavior file explorer file browser provided microsoft windows filename extensions displayed malicious users tried spread computer viruses computer worms using file names formed like loveletterforyoutxtvbs hope appear loveletterforyoutxt harmless text file without alerting user fact harmful computer program case written vbscript default behavior reactos display file extensions reactos explorer
later windows versions starting windows service pack windows server 2003 included customizable lists filename extensions considered dangerous certain zones operation downloaded received email attachment modern antivirus software systems also help defend users attempted attacks possible
viruses take advantage similarity toplevel domain file extension emailing malicious executable commandfile attachments names superficially similar urls mypartyyahoocom effect naive users click emailembedded links think lead websites actually download execute malicious attachments
instances malware crafted exploit vulnerabilities windows applications could cause stackbased buffer overflow opening file overly long unhandled filename extension
alternativesedit
many internet protocols http mime email type bitstream stated media type mime type stream rather filename extension given line text preceding stream contenttype textplain
standard mapping filename extensions media types resulting possible mismatches interpretation authors servers client software transferring files internet instance content author specify extension svgz compressed scalable vector graphics file server recognize extension send proper content type applicationsvgxml required compression header leaving browsers unable correctly interpret display image
beos whose file system supports extended attributes would file media type extended attribute gnome desktop environments associate media type file examining filename suffix contents file fashion file command heuristic choose application launch file opened based media type reducing dependency filename extensions macos uses filename extensions media types well file type codes select uniform type identifier identify file type internally
