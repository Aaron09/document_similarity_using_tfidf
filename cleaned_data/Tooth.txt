tooth plural teeth hard calcified structure found jaws mouths many vertebrates used break food animals particularly carnivores also teeth hunting defensive purposes roots teeth covered gums teeth made bone rather multiple tissues varying density hardness cellular tissues ultimately become teeth originate embryonic germ layer ectoderm
general structure teeth similar across vertebrates although considerable variation form position teeth mammals deep roots pattern also found fish crocodilians teleost fish however teeth attached outer surface bone lizards attached inner surface side cartilaginous fish sharks teeth attached tough ligaments hoops cartilage form jaw1
animals develop teeth monophyodont others develop many sets polyphyodont sharks example grow teeth every weeks replace worn teeth rodent incisors grow wear away continually gnawing helps maintain relatively constant length industry beaver part qualification many rodents voles guinea pigs mice well leporidae like rabbits continuously growing molars addition incisors23
teeth always attached mammals many reptiles fish teeth attached palate floor mouth forming additional rows inside jaws proper teleosts even teeth pharynx true teeth usual sense dermal denticles sharks almost identical structure likely evolutionary origin indeed teeth appear first evolved sharks found primitive jawless fish lampreys toothlike structures tongue fact composed keratin dentine enamel bear relationship true teeth1 though modern teethlike structures dentine enamel found late conodonts supposed evolved independently later vertebrates teeth45
living amphibians typically small teeth none since commonly feed soft foods reptiles teeth generally simple conical shape although variation species notably venominjecting fangs snakes pattern incisors canines premolars molars found mammals varying extents evolutionary ancestors numbers types teeth vary greatly species zoologists standardised dental formula describe precise pattern given group1

origin
genes governing tooth development mammals homologous involved development fish scales6 study tooth plate fossil extinct fish romundina stellina showed teeth scales made tissues also found mammal teeth lending support theory teeth evolved modification scales7
mammals
main article mammal tooth
teeth among distinctive longlasting features mammal species paleontologists teeth identify fossil species determine relationships shape animals teeth related diet example plant matter hard digest herbivores many molars chewing grinding carnivores hand need canines kill prey tear meat
mammals general diphyodont meaning develop sets teeth humans first baby milk primary deciduous normally starts appear months although babies born visible teeth known neonatal teeth normal tooth eruption months known teething painful kangaroos elephants manatees unusual among mammals polyphyodonts
aardvark
aardvarks teeth lack enamel many pulp tubules hence name order tubulidentata
canines
main article canine tooth
dogs teeth less likely humans form dental cavities high saliva prevents enamel demineralizing8 sometimes called cuspidsthese teeth shaped like pointscusps used tearing grasping food9
cetaceans
like human teeth whale teeth polyplike protrusions located root surface tooth polyps made cementum species human teeth protrusions located outside root whales nodule located inside pulp chamber roots human teeth made cementum outer surface whales cementum entire surface tooth small layer enamel small enamel layer seen older whales cementum worn away show underlying enamel10
toothed whale suborder cetaceans characterized teeth teeth differ considerably among species numerous dolphins bearing teeth jaws hand narwhals giant unicornlike tusk tooth containing millions sensory pathways used sensing feeding navigation mating neurologically complex tooth known beaked whales almost toothless bizarre teeth found males teeth used feeding also demonstrating aggression showmanship
primates
main articles human tooth dental anatomy
humans primates usually primary baby teeth whats known permanent teeth addition four third molars wisdom teeth grow
among primary teeth usually found maxilla upper mandible lower among permanent teeth found maxilla mandible teeth uniquely distinguishing features
horse
main article horse teeth
adult horse teeth enamel dentin layers horse teeth intertwined11 horses premolars molars incisors12 generally male equines also four canine teeth called tushes molars incisors however female horses less canines usually many times partially erupted13 horses four wolf teeth vestigial premolars equally common male female horses much likely upper present cause problems interfere horses contact therefore wolf teeth commonly removed12
horse teeth used estimate animals birth five years closely estimated observing eruption pattern milk teeth permanent teeth five permanent teeth usually erupted horse said full mouth five conjectured studying wear patterns incisors shape angle incisors meet factors wear teeth also affected diet natural abnormalities cribbing horses different wear patterns
horses incisors premolars molars fully developed continue erupt grinding surface worn chewing young adult horse teeth inches long majority crown remaining gumline dental socket rest tooth slowly emerge erupting year horse ages animal reaches crowns teeth short teeth often lost altogether horses lacking molars need fodder ground soaked water create soft mush order obtain adequate nutrition
proboscideans




section ivory tusk mammoth


elephants tusks specialized incisors digging food fighting elephant teeth similar manatees notable elephants believed undergone aquatic phase evolution
birth elephants total molar platelike grinding teeth including tusks organized four sets seven successively larger teeth elephant slowly wear lifetime chewing rough plant material four teeth used chewing given time tooth wears another tooth moves forward take place process similar conveyor belt last largest teeth usually becomes exposed animal around years often last additional years last teeth fallen regardless elephants animal longer able chew food starvation1415
rabbit
rabbits lagomorphs usually shed deciduous teeth shortly birth usually born permanent teeth16 teeth rabbits complement diet consists wide range vegetation since many foods abrasive enough cause attrition rabbit teeth grow continuously throughout life17 rabbits total incisors three upper premolars three upper molars lower premolars lower molars side canines three four millimeters tooth worn away incisors every week whereas posterior teeth require month wear away amount18
incisors cheek teeth rabbits called aradicular hypsodont teeth sometimes referred elodent dentition teeth grow erupt continuously growth eruption held balance dental abrasion chewing diet high fiber

manatee
manatees polyphyodont mandibular molars developing separately encased bony shell separated soft tissue
walrus
walrus tusks canine teeth grow continuously throughout life25
fish




teeth great white shark


also pharyngeal teeth shark tooth
fish sharks many teeth lifetime replacement multiple teeth known polyphyodontia
class prehistoric shark called cladodonts strange forked teeth
amphibians
amphibians pedicellate teeth modified flexible connective tissue uncalcified dentine separates crown base tooth26
amphibians exhibit teeth slight attachment acrodont teeth acrodont teeth exhibit limited connection dentary little enervation27 ideal organisms mostly teeth grasping crushing allows rapid regeneration teeth energy cost teeth usually lost course feeding prey struggling additionally amphibians undergo metamorphosis develop bicuspid shaped teeth28
reptiles
teeth reptiles replaced constantly life juvenile crocodilians replace teeth larger ones rate high tooth socket every month adult tooth replacement rates slow years even longer overall crocodilians 3000 teeth birth death teeth created within teeth
invertebrates




european medicinal leech three jaws numerous sharp teeth function like little saws incising host


true teeth unique vertebrates29 although many invertebrates analogous structures often referred teeth organisms simplest genome bearing toothlike structures perhaps parasitic worms family ancylostomatidae30 example hookworm necator americanus dorsal ventral cutting plates teeth around anterior margin buccal capsule also pair subdorsal pair subventral teeth located close rear31
historically european medicinal leech another invertebrate parasite used medicine remove blood patients32 three jaws tripartite look like little saws sharp teeth used incise host incision leaves mark inverted inside circle piercing skin injecting anticoagulants hirudin anaesthetics suck blood consuming times body weight single meal33
species bryozoa first part stomach forms muscular gizzard lined chitinous teeth crush armoured prey diatoms wavelike peristaltic contractions move food stomach digestion34




limpet rasps algae rocks using teeth strongest known tensile strength biological material


molluscs structure called radula bears ribbon chitinous teeth however teeth histologically developmentally different vertebrate teeth unlikely homologous example vertebrate teeth develop neural crest mesenchymederived dental papilla neural crest specific vertebrates tissues enamel29
radula used molluscs feeding sometimes compared rather inaccurately tongue minutely toothed chitinous ribbon typically used scraping cutting food food enters oesophagus radula unique molluscs found every class mollusc apart bivalves
within gastropods radula used feeding herbivorous carnivorous snails slugs arrangement teeth also known denticles radula ribbon varies considerably group another shown diagram left
predatory marine snails naticidae radula plus acidic secretion bore shell molluscs predatory marine snails conidae specialized radula tooth poisoned harpoon predatory pulmonate land slugs ghost slug elongated razorsharp teeth radula seize devour earthworms predatory cephalopods squid radula cutting prey
ancient lineages gastropods radula used graze scraping diatoms microscopic algae rock surfaces substrates limpets scrape algae rocks using radula equipped exceptionally hard rasping teeth35 teeth strongest known tensile strength biological material outperforming spider silk35 mineral protein limpet teeth withstand tensile stress compared spider silk human teeth36

fossilization taphonomy
teeth resistant often preserved bones not37 reflect diet host organism valuable archaeologists palaeontologists early fish thelodonts scales composed dentine enamellike compound suggesting origin teeth scales retained mouth fish early late cambrian dentine exoskeleton functioned defense sensing environment38 dentine hard rest teeth composed collagen fibres reinforced hydroxyapatite38
though teeth resistant also brittle highly susceptible crackingit fact cracking tooth used diagnostic tool predicting bite force
decalcification removes enamel teeth leaves organic interior intact comprises dentine cementine39 enamel quickly decalcified acids40 perhaps dissolution plant acids diagenetic solutions stomachs vertebrate predators39 enamel lost abrasion spalling39 lost dentine bone destroyed fossilisation process40 case skeleton teeth would consist dentine hollow pulp cavity39 organic part dentine conversely destroyed alkalis40
