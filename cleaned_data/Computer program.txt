computer programmingedit
main article computer programming
computer programming process writing editing source code editing source code involves testing analyzing refining sometimes coordinating programmers jointly developed program person practices skill referred computer programmer software developer sometimes coder
sometimes lengthy process computer programming usually referred software development term software engineering becoming popular process seen engineering discipline
programming languagesedit
main article programming language




computer program written imperative programming style


computer programs categorized programming language paradigm used produce main paradigms imperative declarative
imperative languagesedit
imperative programming languages specify sequential algorithm using declarations expressions statements15

declaration couples variable name datatype example integer
expression yields value example yields
statement might assign expression variable value variable alter programs control flow example dosomething

criticism imperative languages side effect assignment statement class variables called nonlocal variables16
declarative languagesedit
declarative programming languages describe computation performed compute declarative programs omit control flow considered sets instructions broad categories declarative languages functional languages logical languages principle behind functional languages like haskell allow side effects makes easier reason programs like mathematical functions16 principle behind logical languages like prolog define problem solved goal leave detailed solution prolog system itself17 goal defined providing list subgoals subgoal defined providing list subgoals path subgoals fails find solution subgoal backtracked another path systematically attempted
compilation interpretationedit
computer program form humanreadable computer programming language called source code source code converted executable image compiler executed immediately interpreter
compilers used translate source code programming language either object code machine code18 object code needs processing become machine code machine code consists central processing units native instructions ready execution compiled computer programs commonly referred executables binary images simply binaries reference binary file format used store executable code
interpreters used execute source code programming language linebyline interpreter decodes statement performs behavior advantage interpreters easily extended interactive session programmer presented prompt individual lines code typed performed immediately
main disadvantage interpreters computer programs slower compiled interpreting code slower interpreter must decode statement perform however software development faster using interpreter testing immediate compiling step omitted another disadvantage interpreters interpreter must present executing computer contrast compiled computer programs need compiler present execution
time compilers precompile computer programs execution example java virtual machine hotspot contains time compiler selectively compiles java bytecode machine code code hotspot predicts likely used many times
either compiled interpreted programs might executed batch process without human interaction
scripting languages often used create batch processes common scripting language unix shell executing environment called commandline interface
properties programming language require exclusively compiled exclusively interpreted categorization usually reflects popular method language execution example java thought interpreted language compiled language despite existence java compilers interpreters
storage executionedit




1950s computer programs stored perforated paper tape


typically computer programs stored nonvolatile memory requested either directly indirectly executed computer user upon request program loaded randomaccess memory computer program called operating system accessed directly central processor central processor executes runs program instruction instruction termination program execution called process19 termination either normal selftermination error software hardware error
simultaneous executionedit
also process computing multiprocessing
many operating systems support multitasking enables many computer programs appear simultaneously computer operating systems multiple programs process scheduling software mechanism switch among processes often users interact program runs20 within hardware modern multiprocessor computers computers multicore processors multiple programs21
multiple lines computer program simultaneously executed using threads multithreading processors optimized execute multiple threads efficiently
selfmodifying programsedit
main article selfmodifying code
computer program execution normally treated different data program operates however cases distinction blurred computer program modifies modified computer program subsequently executed part program selfmodifying code possible programs written machine code assembly language lisp cobol prolog
functional categoriesedit
computer programs categorized along functional lines main functional categories application software system software system software includes operating system couples computer hardware application software22 purpose operating system provide environment application software executes convenient efficient manner22 addition operating system system software includes embedded programs boot programs micro programs application software designed users user interface application software designed user includes middleware couples application another application software also includes utility programs distinction system software application software debate
application softwareedit
