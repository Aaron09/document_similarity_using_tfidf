empires traced back recorded history goes indeed history history empires nationstate—an essentially 19thcentury ideal—that historical novelty prove ephemeral entity54


field’s fixation westphalian state tended obscure fact main actors global politics time immemorial empires rather states fact distorted view even westphalian recognize always least much empires states almost emerging european states sooner began consolidate campaigns conquest commerce farthest reaches globe… ironically european empires carried idea sovereign territorial state rest world…55


empire historically predominant form order world politics looking time frame several millennia global anarchic system european explorations subsequent imperial colonial ventures connected disparate regional systems approximately years prior emergence globalscope system pattern world politics characterized regional systems reginal systems initially anarchic marked high levels military competition almost universally tended consolidate regional empires… thus empires—not anarchic state systems—that typically dominated regional systems parts world… within global pattern regional empires european political order distinctly anomalous persisted long anarchy56

similarly anthony pagden eliot cohen jane burbank frederick cooper estimate “empires always frequent extensive political social forms tribal territories nations ever been”57 many empires endured centuries ancient egyptian chinese japanese empires counted millennia “most people throughout history lived imperial rule58

universal empireedit

states systems ended universal empire swallowed states system examples abundant must questions states system fairly directly establishment world empire evidence rather suggest expect states system culminate might argued every state system maintain existence balance power latter inherently unstable sooner later tensions conflicts resolved monopoly power67

earliest thinker approach phenomenon universal empire theoretical point view polybius

previous times events world occurred without impinging another history became whole single body events italy libya came enmeshed asia greece everything gets directed towards single goal

world longer large enough harbor several selfcontained powers trend toward world domination hegemony single power ultimate consummation powersystem engrafted upon otherwise integrated world80

writing last year german historian ludwig dehio drew similar conclusion

european tendency toward division thrust aside global trend toward unification onrush trend come rest asserted throughout planet… global order still seems going birth pangs last tempest barely gathering81
