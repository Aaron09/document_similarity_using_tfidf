information history free open source software
1990s foundation open source initiativeedit
early days computing programmers developers shared software order learn evolve field computing eventually open source notion moved side commercialization software years 19701980 1997 eric raymond published cathedral bazaar reflective analysis hacker community free software principles paper received significant attention early 1998 factor motivating netscape communications corporation release popular netscape communicator internet suite free software source code subsequently became basis behind seamonkey mozilla firefox thunderbird kompozer
netscapes prompted raymond others look bring free software foundations free software ideas perceived benefits commercial software industry concluded fsfs social activism appealing companies like netscape looked rebrand free software movement emphasize business potential sharing collaborating software source code8 term chose open source soon adopted bruce perens publisher oreilly linus torvalds others open source initiative founded february 1998 encourage term evangelize opensource principles9
open source initiative sought encourage term evangelize principles adhered commercial software vendors found increasingly threatened concept freely distributed software universal access applications source code microsoft executive publicly stated 2001 open source intellectual property destroyer cant imagine something could worse software business intellectualproperty business10 however free open software foss historically played role outside mainstream private software development companies large microsoft begun develop official opensource presences internet oracle google state farm companies serious public stake todays competitive opensource market significant shift corporate philosophy concerning development foss11
free software movement launched 1983 1998 group individuals advocated term free software replaced opensource software expression less ambiguous121314 comfortable corporate world15 software developers want publish software opensource license anybody also develop software understand internal functioning opensource software generally anyone allowed create modifications port operating systems instruction architectures share others cases market scholars casson ryan pointed several policybased reasons adoption open source particular heightened value proposition open source compared proprietary formats following categories

security
affordability
transparency
perpetuity
interoperability
flexibility
localization—particularly context local governments make software decisions casson ryan argue governments inherent responsibility fiduciary duty taxpayers includes careful analysis factors deciding purchase proprietary software implement opensource option16

open source definition notably presents opensource philosophy defines terms modification redistribution opensource software software licenses grant rights users would otherwise reserved copyright copyright holder several opensource software licenses qualified within boundaries open source definition prominent popular example general public license allows free distribution condition developments applications licence thus also free17
open source label came strategy session held april 1998 palo alto reaction netscapes january 1998 announcement source code release navigator mozilla group individuals session included oreilly linus torvalds paquin jamie zawinski larry wall brian behlendorf sameer parekh eric allman greg olson paul vixie john ousterhout guido rossum philip zimmermann john gilmore eric raymond18 used opportunity release navigators source code clarify potential confusion caused ambiguity word free english
many people claimed birth internet since 1969 started open source movement others distinguish opensource free software movements19
free software foundation started 1985 intended word free mean freedom distribute free free speech freedom cost free free beer since great deal free software already still free charge free software became associated zero cost seemed anticommercial8
open source initiative formed february 1998 eric raymond bruce perens least years evidence case histories closed software development versus open development already provided internet developer community presented open source case commercial businesses like netscape hoped label open source term suggested peterson foresight institute strategy session would eliminate ambiguity particularly individuals perceive free software anticommercial sought bring higher profile practical benefits freely available source code wanted bring major software businesses hightech industries open source perens attempted register open source service mark attempt impractical trademark standards meanwhile presentation raymonds paper upper management netscape—raymond discovered read press release20 called netscape barksdales later day—netscape released navigator source code open source favorable results21

open source initiatives definition recognized governments internationally22 standard facto definition addition many worlds largest open source software projects contributors including debian drupal association freebsd foundation linux foundation mozilla foundation wikimedia foundation wordpress foundation committed23 upholding osis mission open source definition affiliate agreement24
uses open source definition determine whether considers software license open source definition based debian free software guidelines written adapted primarily perens252627 perens base writing four freedoms free software foundation widely available later28
perens definition open source describes broad general type software license makes source code available general public relaxed nonexistent restrictions modification code explicit feature open source puts restrictions distribution organization user order enable rapid evolution software29
despite initially accepting it30 richard stallman flatly opposes term open source applied refer free software although agrees terms describe almost category software stallman considers equating terms incorrect misleading31 stallman also opposes professed pragmatism open source initiative fears free software ideals freedom community threatened compromising fsfs idealistic standards software freedom32 considers free software subset open source software richard stallman explained software example developed open source despite give users freedom restricts thus doesnt qualify free software33
opensource software licensingedit

examples free software license opensource licenses include apache license license general public license lesser general public license license eclipse public license mozilla public license
proliferation opensource licenses negative aspect opensource movement often difficult understand legal implications differences licenses 180000 opensource projects available 1400 unique licenses complexity deciding manage opensource within closedsource commercial enterprises dramatically increased homegrown others modeled mainstream foss licenses berkeley software distribution apache mitstyle massachusetts institute technology general public license view opensource practitioners starting classification schemes foss licenses grouped typically based existence obligations imposed copyleft provision strength copyleft provision35
important legal milestone open source free software movement passed 2008 federal appeals court ruled free software licenses definitely legally binding conditions copyrighted work therefore enforceable existing copyright result endusers violate licensing conditions license disappears meaning infringing copyright36 despite licensing risk commercial software vendors using open source software commercial products fulfilling license terms leveraging apache license37

development modeledit
1997 essay cathedral bazaar40 opensource evangelist eric raymond suggests model developing known bazaar model raymond likens development software traditional methodologies building cathedral carefully crafted individual wizards small bands mages working splendid isolation40 suggests software developed using bazaar style described great babbling bazaar differing agendas approaches40
traditional model development called cathedral model development takes place centralized roles clearly defined roles include people dedicated designing architects people responsible managing project people responsible implementation traditional software engineering follows cathedral model
bazaar model however different model roles clearly defined gregorio robles41 suggests software developed using bazaar model exhibit following patterns

users treated codevelopers
users treated like codevelopers access source code software furthermore users encouraged submit additions software code fixes software reports documentation codevelopers increases rate software evolves linuss states given enough eyeballs bugs shallow means many users view source code eventually find bugs suggest note users advanced programming skills furthermore users machine provides additional testing environment testing environment offers ability find
early releases
first version software released early possible increase ones chances finding codevelopers early
frequent integration
code changes integrated merged shared code base often possible avoid overhead fixing large number bugs project life cycle open source projects nightly builds integration done automatically daily basis
several versions
least versions software buggier version features stable version fewer features buggy version also called development version users want immediate latest features willing accept risk using code thoroughly tested users codevelopers reporting bugs providing fixes
high modularization
general structure software modular allowing parallel development independent components
dynamic decision making structure
need decision making structure whether formal informal makes strategic decisions depending changing user requirements factors compare extreme programming

data suggests however quite democratic bazaar model suggests analysis five billion bytes freeopen source code 31999 developers shows code written active authors average number authors involved project median
advantages disadvantagesedit
open source software usually easier obtain proprietary software often resulting increased additionally availability open source implementation standard increase adoption standard43 also helped build developer loyalty developers feel empowered sense ownership product44
moreover lower costs marketing logistical services needed also helps companies keep abreast technology developments good tool promote companys image including commercial products45 development approach helped produce reliable high quality software quickly inexpensively46
open source development offers potential flexible technology quicker innovation said reliable since typically thousands independent programmers testing fixing bugs software open source dependent company author originally created even company fails code continues exist developed users also uses open standards accessible everyone thus problem incompatible formats exist proprietary software
flexible modular systems allow programmers build custom interfaces abilities innovative since open source programs product collaboration among large number different programmers divergent perspectives corporate objectives personal goals speeds innovation47
moreover free software developed accord purely technical requirements require thinking commercial pressure often degrades quality software commercial pressures make traditional software developers attention customers requirements security requirements since features somewhat invisible customer48
sometimes said open source development process well defined stages development process system testing documentation ignored however true small mostly single programmer projects larger successful projects define enforce least rules need make teamwork possible4950 complex projects rules strict reviewing even minor change independent developers51
initiatives successful example sourcexchange eazel44 software experts researchers convinced open sources ability produce quality systems identify unclear process late defect discovery lack empirical evidence important problems collected data concerning productivity quality52 also difficult design commercially sound business model around open source paradigm consequently technical requirements satisfied ones market52 terms security open source allow hackers know weaknesses loopholes software easily closedsource software depends control mechanisms order create effective performance autonomous agents participate virtual organizations53
development toolsedit
development tools used support development product development process itself54
revision control systems concurrent versions system later subversion examples tools often open source help manage source code files changes files software project55 projects frequently hosted published sites like launchpad bitbucket github56
open source projects often loosely organized little formalised process modelling support utilities issue trackers often used organize open source software development54 commonly used bugtrackers include bugzilla redmine57
tools mailing lists provide means coordination among developers54 centralized code hosting sites also social features allow developers communicate56
organizationsedit
prominent organizations involved development include apache software foundation creators apache server linux foundation nonprofit 2012update employed linus torvalds creator linux operating system kernel eclipse foundation home eclipse software development platform debian project creators influential debian gnulinux distribution mozilla foundation home firefox browser europeanborn community developing open source middleware organizations tend sophisticated governance model membership often formed legal entity members58
open source software institute membershipbased nonprofit organization established 2001 promotes development implementation open source software solutions within federal state local government agencies ossis efforts focused promoting adoption open source software programs policies within federal government defense homeland security communities59

closed source proprietary softwareedit
main article comparison open source closed source
debate open source closed source alternatively called proprietary software sometimes heated
four reasons provided open source business conference survey63 individuals organizations choose open source software

lower cost
security
vendor lock
better quality

since innovative companies longer rely heavily software sales proprietary software become less necessity64 things like open source content management system—or cms—deployments becoming commonplace 200965 white house switched system proprietary system drupal open source companies like novell traditionally sold software oldfashioned continually debate benefits switching open source availability already switched part product offering open source code66 open source software provides solutions unique specific problems reported67 enterpriselevel companies open source software offerings capacity
market shift critical systems beginning rely open source offerings68 allowing greater funding department homeland security grants68 help hunt security bugs according pilot study organisations adopting adopting several factors statistical significance observed managers beliefs relation attitudes toward outcomes influences behaviours others ability act69
proprietary source distributors started develop contribute open source community market share shift need reinvent models order remain competitive70
many advocates argue open source software inherently safer person view edit change code71 study linux source code bugs 1000 lines code proprietary software generally scores 20–30 bugs 1000 lines72
free softwareedit
main article alternative terms free software
also comparison free opensource software licenses
according free software movements leader richard stallman main difference choosing term either open source free software lets others know ones goals open source development methodology free software social movement32 nevertheless significant overlap open source software free software33
fsf73 said term open source fosters ambiguity different kind confuses mere availability source freedom modify redistribute hand free software term criticized ambiguity word free available cost seen discouraging business adoption74 historical ambiguous usage term87576
developers used alternative terms free open source software foss freelibre open source software floss consequently describe open source software also free software77 definition open source software similar fsfs free software definition78 based debian free software guidelines written adapted primarily bruce perens input eric raymond others79
term open source originally intended trademarkable however term deemed descriptive trademark exists80 would prefer people treat open source trademark describe software licensed approved license81

opensource versus sourceavailableedit
although definition open source software widely accepted small number people organizations term refer software source available viewing legally modified redistributed software often referred sourceavailable shared source term coined microsoft 200183 2007 shared source licenses certified shared source licenses still sourceavailable only84
2007 michael tiemann president criticized85 companies sugarcrm promoting software open source fact osiapproved license sugarcrms case software socalled badgeware86 since specified badge must displayed user interface sugarcrm since switched gplv387 another example scilab prior version called open source platform numerical computation88 license89 forbade commercial redistribution modified versions
