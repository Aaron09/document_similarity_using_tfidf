method tenacity policy sticking initial belief brings comforts decisiveness leads trying ignore contrary information others views truth intrinsically private public method goes social impulse easily falters since well notice anothers opinion seems good ones initial opinion successes brilliant tend transitory
method authority overcomes disagreements sometimes brutally successes majestic longlasting cannot regulate people thoroughly enough withstand doubts indefinitely especially people learn societies present past
method priori promotes conformity less brutally fosters opinions something like tastes arising conversation comparisons perspectives terms agreeable reason thereby depends fashion paradigms goes circles time intellectual respectable like first methods sustains accidental capricious beliefs destining minds doubt
method science wherein inquiry supposes real discoverable independent particular opinion unlike methods inquiry account wrong fallibilism right thus purposely tests criticizes corrects improves

peirce held practical affairs slow stumbling ratiocination often dangerously inferior instinct traditional sentiment scientific method best suited theoretical research149 turn trammeled methods practical ends reasons first rule115 order learn must desire learn corollary must block inquiry scientific method excels others finally deliberately designed arrive eventually secure beliefs upon successful practices based starting idea people seek truth instead subdue irritating inhibitory doubt peirce showed struggle come submit truth sake beliefs integrity seek truth guidance potential conduct correctly given goal scientific method
