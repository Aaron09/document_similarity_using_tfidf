plunging first competitive diving sport


although diving popular pastime across world since ancient times first modern diving competitions held england 1880s exact origins sport unclear though likely derives diving start swimming races23 1904 book swimming ralph thomas notes english reports plunging records dating back least 18654 1877 edition british rural sports john henry walsh makes note young plunging feet 1870 also states years prior swimmer named drake could cover feet5
english amateur swimming association time called swimming association great britain first started plunging championship 188367 plunging championship discontinued 1937
fancy divingedit
diving body water also method used gymnasts germany sweden since early 19th century soft landing allowed elaborate gymnastic feats midair jump could made greater height tradition evolved fancy diving diving preliminary swimming became known plain diving
england practice high diving diving great height gained popularity first diving stages erected highgate ponds height feet 1893 first world championship event national graceful diving competition held royal life saving society 1895 event consisted standing running dives either feet
event swedish tradition fancy diving introduced sport athletes otto hagborg mauritzi demonstrated acrobatic techniques diving board highgate pond stimulated establishment amateur diving association 1901 first organization devoted diving world later amalgamated amateur swimming association fancy diving formally introduced championship 190389

competitive divingedit
diving competitions consist three disciplines springboards platform competitive athletes divided gender often group platform events competitors allowed perform dives either five seven half generally called seven nine meter towers major diving meets including olympic games world championships platform diving meter height

scoring diveedit
rules governing scoring dive usually score considers three elements dive approach flight entry primary factors affecting scoring

handstand required length time quality hold
height diver apex dive extra height resulting higher score
distance diver diving apparatus throughout dive diver must dangerously close away ideally within feet platform
properly defined body position diver according dive performed including pointed toes feet touching times
proper amounts rotation revolution upon completion dive entry water
angle entry diver enter water straight without angle
amount splash many judges award divers amount splash created diver entry less splash resulting higher score

dive assigned degree difficulty dd10 determined combination moves undertaken position used height value multiplied scores given judges
reduce subjectivity scoring major meets panels five seven judges assembled major international events olympics sevenjudge panels fivejudge panel highest lowest scores discarded middle three summed multiplied sevenjudge panels 2012 london olympics highest scores lowest discarded leaving three summed multiplied prior london olympics highest lowest scores eliminated remaining five scores multiplied ​3⁄5 allow comparison fivejudge panels canceling scores used make difficult single judge manipulate scores
general misconception scoring judging serious meets absolute score somewhat meaningless relative score absolute score wins meets accordingly good judging implies consistent scoring across dives specifically judge consistently gives scores divers consistently gives high scores divers judging yield fair relative results cause divers place correct order however absolute scores significance individual divers besides obvious instances setting records absolute scores also used rankings qualifications higher level meets
synchronised diving events panel seven nine eleven judges three mark execution diver three mark execution remaining three five judge synchronisation execution judges positioned side pool score diver nearer 2012 london olympics first eleven judges
score computed similarly scores diving events modified starting 2012 london olympics larger judging panels group judges highest lowest scores dropped leaving middle score divers execution three middle scores synchronization total weighted ​3⁄5 multiplied result emphasis synchronization divers

competitive strategyedit




1984 1988 olympic gold medal diver greg louganis


dive meets divers create dive list advance meet meet diver must accumulate points divers often simple dives look good spectators meets competitive diver attempt highest dives possible achieve consistent high scores divers scoring dives sign extreme skill sign dive list competitive lose meet diver higher lower scores
competition divers must submit lists beforehand past deadline usually event announced shortly begins cannot change dives fail perform dive announced even physically cannot execute dive announced perform difficult dive receive score zero exceptional circumstances redive granted exceedingly rare usually young divers learning compete event outside divers control caused unable performsuch loud noise
olympics highly competitive meets many divers nearly list dives competitors importance divers competing level much arrange list difficult rounds dives begin important lead confident dive build momentum also tend confident dive front difficult dive ensure good mentality difficult dive divers predive postdive rituals help either maintain regain focus coaches also play role aspect sport many divers rely coaches help keep composure meet large meet coaches rarely allowed deck talk athlete common coaches using hand gestures body movements communicate
american meets allow changes position dive even dive announced immediately execution exception rules generally observed internationally
generally ncaa rules allow dives changed diver board diver must request change directly dive announced applies especially cases wrong dive announced diver pauses hurdle change dive declared balk diver stops midhurdle change dive permitted
fina dive changed deadline divesheet submitted generally period ranging hour hours depending rulings made event organiser
divers responsibility ensure divesheet filled correctly also correct referee announcer dive describe incorrectly dive performed submitted incorrectly announced declared failed scores zero according strict reading fina practice redive would usually granted circumstances
governanceedit
global governing body diving fina also governs swimming synchronised swimming water polo open water swimming almost invariably national level diving shares governing body aquatic sports
frequently source political friction committees naturally dominated swimming officials necessarily share understand concerns diving community divers often feel example adequate support issues like provision facilities areas concern selection personnel specialised diving committees coaching officiating events team selection international competitions
sometimes attempts separate governing body means resolve frustrations rarely successful example great britain diving federation formed 1992 intention taking governance diving amateur swimming association although initially received widespread support diving community fina requirement international competitors registered national governing body major factor abandonment ambition years later
since fina refused rescind recognition british governing body aquatic sports including diving meant elite divers belong asaaffiliated clubs eligible selection international competition
united states scholastic diving almost always part schools swim team diving separate sport olympic club diving ncaa separate diving swimming special diving competitions swim season completed

mechanics divingedit




tomb diver paestum italy greek fresco dated


moment takeoff critical aspects dive determined cannot subsequently altered execution trajectory dive magnitude angular momentum
speed rotation therefore total amount rotation varied moment moment changing shape body accordance conservation angular momentum
center mass diver follows parabolic path freefall influence gravity ignoring effects resistance negligible speeds involved15
trajectoryedit
since parabola symmetrical travel away board diver passes twice amount forward travel peak flight excessive forward distance entry point penalized scoring dive obviously adequate clearance diving board essential safety grounds
greatest possible height achieved desirable several reasons

height attained factors judges reward
greater height gives longer flight time therefore time execute maneuvers
given clearance passing board forward travel distance entry point less higher trajectory

control rotationedit
magnitude angular momentum remains constant throughout dive since



angular momentum rotational velocity moment inertia



moment inertia larger body increased radius speed rotation increased moving body compact shape reduced opening straight position
since tucked shape compact gives control rotational speed dives position easier perform dives straight position hardest since almost scope altering speed angular momentum must created takeoff high degree accuracy small amount control available moving position arms slight hollowing back
opening body entry stop rotation merely slows vertical entry achieved expert divers largely illusion created starting entry slightly short vertical legs vertical disappear beneath surface small amount additional tuning available entry save techniques whereby underwater movements upper body arms viscosity water affect position legs16
twistingedit




twisting dive performed 10meter platform


dives multiple twists somersaults spectacular movements well challenging perform
rules state twisting must generated manifestly takeoff consequently divers must somersaulting angular momentum generate twisting movements physics twisting explained looking components angular momentum vector
diver leaves board total angular momentum vector horizontal pointing directly left forward dive example twisting rotation exist necessary tilt body sideways takeoff small component horizontal angular momentum vector along bodys long axis tilt seen photo
tilting done arms outstretched sides twist moved moved like turning steering wheel body reacts tilting side begins twisting rotation completion required number twist rotations motion reversed steering wheel turned back removes bodys tilt stops twisting rotation
alternative explanation moving arms precession torque body twisting rotation moving arms back produces opposite torque stops twisting rotation
entryedit
rules state body vertical nearly entry strictly speaking physically impossible achieve literally vertical position throughout entry inevitably still rotational momentum body entering water divers therefore attempt create illusion vertical especially performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements back entries technique allow upper body enter slightly short vertical continuing rotation leaves final impression legs entering vertically called pike save another knee save movements scooping upper body underwater direction rotation counteract rotation legs
arms must beside body feetfirst dives typically competed springboard fairly levels springboard extended forwards line headfirst dives much common competitively used common hands interlocked fingers extended towards water different technique become favoured last decades usual practice hand grasp palms strike water flat surface creates vacuum hands arms head vertical entry pull splash deep enough minimal effect surface water socalled entry
diver completely water choose roll scoop direction dive rotating pull legs vertical position apart aesthetic considerations important safety point view divers reinforce habit rolling direction rotation especially forward inward entries back injuries hyperextention caused attempting resurface opposite direction diving higher levels increases danger likelihood injuries
