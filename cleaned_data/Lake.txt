hydrology book proposes define term lake body water following five characteristics4

partially totally fills several basins connected straits4
essentially water level parts except relatively shortlived variations caused wind varying cover large inflows etc4
regular intrusion seawater4
considerable portion sediment suspended water captured basins happen need sufficiently small inflowtovolume ratio4

types lakes according thermal stratificationedit
addition origin various ways either naming defining types lakes major classification lakes basis thermal stratification major control animal plant life inhabiting lake fate distribution dissolved suspended material lake example thermal stratification degree frequency mixing exerts strong control distribution oxygen within addition lake classified according important factors seasonal variations lake volume level oxygen saturation salinity water mass finally names types lakes used public scientific different types lakes often informally derived either morphology aspects physical characteristics
forel30 also referred father limnology first scientist classify lakes according thermal stratification31 system classification later modified improved upon hutchinson laffler32 density water varies temperature maximum thermal stratification important physical characteristic lakes controls fauna flora sedimentation chemistry aspects individual lakes first colder heavier water typically forms layer near bottom called hypolimnion second normally overlying transition zone known metalimnion finally overlying metalimnion surface layer warmer lighter water called epilimnion however typical stratification sequence vary widely depending either specific lake time season combination both193132
based upon thermal stratification lakes classified either holomictic lakes meromictic lakes meromictic lake lake layers water intermix deepest layer water lake contain dissolved oxygen addition layers sediment bottom meromictic lake remain relatively undisturbed living aerobic organisms lack disturbance allows development lacustrine varves holomictic lake lake uniform temperature density bottom specific time year uniformity temperature density allows lake waters completely holomictic lakes nonmeromictic lakes based upon thermal stratification frequency turnover holomictic lakes divided amictic lakes cold monomictic lakes dimictic lakes warm monomictic lakes polymictic lakes oligomictic lakes classification lakes thermal stratification presupposes lakes sufficient depth form hypolimnion results shallow lakes excluded classification system1932
stratification lake always result variation density thermal gradients stratification within lake also result differences density resulting gradients salinity case difference salinity hypolimnion epilimnion separated thermocline halocline sometimes referred chemocline1932
types lake according seasonal variation lake level volumeedit
lakes informally classified named according seasonal variation lake level volume names include

ephemeral lake shortlived lake pond33 fills water dries disappears seasonally known intermittent lake34 often fill poljes35
lake popular name ephemeral lake contains water intermediately irregular infrequent intervals2536
perennial lake lake water basin throughout year subject extreme fluctuations level2533
playa lake typically shallow intermittent lake covers occupies playa either seasons especially years subsequently drying arid semiarid region2536
vlei name used south africa shallow lake varies considerably level seasons37

types lake according water chemistryedit
lakes also informally classified named according general chemistry water mass types lakes include

acid lake lake neutral lake considered highly acid drops biological consequences occur lakes include acid lakes occupying abandoned mines excavations naturally acid lakes igneous metamorphic landscapes peat bogs northern regions acidsaline lakes arid environments crater lakes active dormant volcanoes lakes acidified acid rain383940
salt lake also known brine lake inland body water situated arid semiarid region outlet containing high concentration dissolved salts principally sodium chloride examples include great salt lake utah dead near east2536
alkali sink also known salt flats lakes extreme scale large deep saline lakes shallow saline features occupy lowlying areas arid regions groundwater discharge zones typically classifiable either playas playa lakes periodically flooded either rain flood events drier intervals leaving accumulations brines evaporitic minerals2536
salt saltpan either undrained small shallow natural depression water accumulates evaporates leaving salt deposit shallow lake brackish water occupying salt term also used large recovering salt evaporation25
saline name ephemeral saline lake precipitates bottom crust subsequently modified subaerial exposure25

paleolakesedit
paleolake also spelt palaeolake lake existed past hydrological conditions different43 quaternary paleolakes often identified basis relict lacustrine landforms relict lake plains coastal landforms form recognizable relict shorelines called paleoshorelines paleolakes also recognized characteristic sedimentary deposits accumulated fossils sediments might contain paleoshorelines sedimentary deposits paleolakes provide evidence prehistoric hydrological changes times existed4344
types paleolakes include

former lake lake longer existence lakes include prehistoric lakes lakes permanently dried often result either evaporation human intervention owens lake california example former lake former lakes common feature basin range area southwestern north america45
shrunken lake lake drastically decreased size geological time lake agassiz covered much central north america good example shrunken lake notable remnants lake lake winnipeg lake winnipegosis45

paleolakes scientific economic importance example quaternary paleolakes semidesert basins important reasons first played extremely significant transient role shaping floors piedmonts many basins finally sediments contain enormous quantities geologic paleontologic information concerning past environments46 addition organicrich deposits prequaternary paleolakes important either thick deposits shale shale contain source rocks petroleum natural although significantly less economic importance strata deposited along shore paleolakes sometimes contain coal seams4748
