bill woodfulls stance


stanceedit
stance position batsman stands ball bowled ideal stance comfortable relaxed balancedcitation needed feet centimetres apart parallel astride crease additionally front shoulder pointing wicket head facing bowler weight equally balanced near back toe2 ball released batsman lift behind anticipation playing stroke shift weight onto balls feet ready move swiftly position address ball sees path bowlers hand
although textbook sideon stance common international batsmen shivnarine chanderpaul open square stance
backliftedit
backlift term used describe batsman lifts preparation hitting ball3
raised vertically possible coaching manuals often suggest correct technique slightly angled perpendicular common instruction point face direction first second slip3
players notably recent times brian lara virender sehwag4 employed exaggerated backlift others employed unorthodox open stance peter willey abbreviated backlift
forward backedit
depending upon path ball batsman either move forward back attempt intercept forward movement designated front foot shot whereas backwards movement designated back foot shot front foot shot typically used address ball arriving ankle thigh height batsman step forward towards ball bending front knee bring anticipated height ball moving forwards batsman also able intercept ball immediately pitched thus nullifying potentially dangerous lateral movement back foot shot typically used address ball arriving thigh head height batsman step back necessary stand toes raise height ball stepping back towards wicket also receives advantage extra small amount time react unexpected lateral movement variation bounce
leaveedit




leave note batsmans head focussed ball bounced hands held well ball


leave sometimes considered cricket shot even though batsman physically play interfere ball passes leave likely used batsmen first balls receive give time judge conditions pitch bowling attempting play shot leaving delivery matter judgement technique batsman still watch ball closely ensure wicket also ensure hands kept path ball cannot make accidental contact possibly lead caught batsmen leave ball certain stumps
vertical strokesedit
vertical straightbat shots played either front foot back foot depending upon anticipated height ball moment reaches batsman characteristic position vertical alignment point contact vertical shots typically played batsmans head directly point contact able accurately judge line ball point either stationary facing straight back wicket known block defensive shot angled side known glance deflection travelling forwards towards bowler known drive
defensive shotedit




taken long stride batsman blocks ball forward defensive shot


block stroke usually purely defensive stroke designed stop ball hitting wicket batsmans body shot strength behind usually played light soft bottomhand grip merely stops ball moving towards wicket block played front foot known forward defensive played back foot known backward defensive application strokes used score runs manipulating block move ball vacant portions infield case block becomes push pushing ball common ways batsmen manipulate strike
leaving blocking employed much often firstclass cricket including test matches requirement score runs quickly possible thus allowing batsman choose deliveries play
glanceedit




ranjitsinhji playing glance 1897


glance delicate straightbatted shot played ball aimed slightly side using flick ball passes batsman requiring wrist work well deflecting towards square fine area stroke involves deflecting batface towards side last moment head body moving inside line ball shot played toes shins played front foot ball pitched toes shin batsman back foot ball bounces waisthip height batsman although opposite term glance employed within cricket concept angling face towards offside deflect ball away wicket purpose scoring runs side commonly used technique would commonly described instead running steering ball third
driveedit




ellyse perry plays drive front foot notice stance position hands legs body head


drive straightbatted shot played swinging vertical line ball hitting ball front batsman along ground common shots batsmans armoury often first shot taught junior cricketers depending direction ball travels drive cover drive struck towards cover fielding position drive towards midoff straight drive straight past bowler drive stumps midon square drive towards point drive also played towards midwicket although phrase midwicket drive common usage drives played front back foot backfoot drives harder force line ball although drives deliberately struck along ground reduce risk dismissed caught batsman decide play lofted drive ball infielders potentially even boundary

virat kohli playing flick shot 2015


flick shot straightbatted shot played side flicking fulllength delivery using wrists often also called clip legs shot playing coming straight drive face angled towards side played front foot back foot either toes hips shot played square region typically played along ground flick also played lofting ball infield
horizontal shotsedit
second class cricket stroke comprises horizontal shots also known cross shots square drive pull hook sweep typically horizontal shots greater probability failing make contact ball vertical shots therefore restricted deliveries threatening stumps either dint wide short swung horizontal batsmans head typically perfectly line ball point contact
cutedit




batsman plays back foot note balance weight batsman back right


crossbatted shot played shortpitched ball placing wide side batsman makes contact ball draws alongside passes therefore requires virtually effort part uses bowlers pace divert ball square shot side near degrees wicket towards point late played ball passes batsmans body towards third shot typically played back foot also sometimes played front foot slower bowling played face rolling ball face ground thus pushing ball downwards mistimed openfaced face facing bowler generally lead ball rising giving chance batsman caught
square driveedit
although confusingly named drive square drive actually horizontal shot identical mechanics square difference square drive height ball contact played ball bouncing waist high batsman standing tall whereas square drive played wide ball shin height batsman bending knees crouching make contact
pull hookedit




ricky ponting playing pull shot

unorthodox strokeplayedit
since batsman free play shot type delivery wishes list means complete list strokes batsmen choose play many unorthodox typically highrisk shots used throughout history game advent limited overs cricket seen increased unorthodox shots ball gaps fielders placed unorthodox shots rarely used firstclass cricket pace game slower relatively important keep ones wicket score runs every ball
unorthodox shots gained enough popularity notoriety given names entered common usage
reverse sweepedit
reverse sweep crossbatted sweep shot played opposite direction standard sweep thus instead sweeping ball side swept side towards backward point third batsman also swap hands handle make stroke easier execute batsman also bring back foot front therefore making like traditional sweep advantage reverse sweep effectively reverses fielding positions thus difficult field also risky shot batsman increases chance also quite easy edge fielder
first regularly played 1970s pakistani batsman mushtaq mohammad though mushtaqs brother hanif mohammad sometimes credited inventor cricket coach woolmer credited popularising stroke famous example reverse sweep backfiring case mike gatting england allan border australia 1987 cricket world final england course victory gatting attempted reverse sweep first delivery bowled border topedged ball caught wicketkeeper greg dyer england subsequently lost momentum eventually lost match
unorthodox nature hand body position often difficult power behind reverse sweep many situations intention glance ball backward area however rare occasions players able execute reverse sweeps kevin pietersen pioneered switch hitting adept could argueoriginal research resulting shot basically sweep rather reverse sweep classic example shot would yusuf pathans robin peterson south africas villiers well known ability sixes reverse sweep ease glenn maxwell also often plays reverse sweep
slog slog sweepedit
slog powerful pull shot played midwicket usually attempt score shot would described slog typically played delivery would ordinarily pulled slog also described hitting ball corner phrase designed imply batsman unsophisticated strokeplay technique suggesting would home playing rudimentary cricket fields cows grazing along boundary edge slog effective shot batsmans power body weight swinging ball
slog sweep slog played kneeling position used sweep slog sweeps usually directed squareleg rather midwicket almost exclusively used reasonably fullpitched balls slow bowlers batsman time sight length adopt kneeling position required slog sweep front shot usually placed wider outside stump allow full swing
upper cutedit
upper shot played towards third usually ball pitched outside stump extra bounce dangerous shot edge batsman keeper slips executed correctly shot widely used modern cricket shot advantageous fast bouncy tracks seen commonly twenty20 cricket
switch hitedit
switch shot batsman changes handedness posture adopt stance mirror image traditional handedness bowler running bowl fielding team cannot manoeuvre fielders bowler runup fielding side effectively wrongfooted fielders position shot pioneered kevin pietersen first performed bowling muttiah muralitharan englands 2006 home series lanka subsequently used zealand series england 2008 pietersen performed shot twice scott styris making unbeaten century david warner australian opening batsman also frequent user switch used great effect indian offspinner ravichandran ashwin first twenty20 indian cricket teams tour australia 2012 also possible righthanded experience youth cricket
legality switch questioned first introduced cleared international cricket council legal shot risky batsman less proficient handedness likely make mistake execution shot
scoop rampedit
scoop shot also known ramp shot paddle scoop marillier shot dilscoop used number firstclass batsmen first dougie marillier played short pitched straight balls would traditionally defended aggressively pulled side play scoop shot batsman front foot aims beneath bounce ball directly behind stumps wicketkeeper
shot though risky execution advantage aimed section field fielder rarely placed particularly twenty20 international cricket number outfielders limited however marillier shot played batsmans shoulder fine basis scoop stroke batsman knee good length slightly shortoflength delivery fast medium paced bowler scoop ball head wicketkeeper scoop shot risky shot play improper execution shot lead catch offered famous example scoop backfiring 2007 world twenty20 final pakistan 1529 needed runs balls misbahulhaq improperly executed shot resulting catch sreesanth
version scoop stroke called dilscoop developed lankan righthanded batsman tillakaratne dilshan 2009 world twenty20
strategy battingedit
fundamental batsman find means safely scoring runs bowler faces batsman must take consideration bowlers strategy position fielders pitch conditions strengths weaknesses strategy decide incorporate number preconceived attacking responses various deliveries anticipate receiving designed specifically score runs minimal risk dismissed success strategy dependent upon accuracy conception technical ability carried level aggression strategy informed target rate calculated risk losing wicket dependent upon match situation strategies vary three forms international cricket test cricket international cricket
oneday international cricketedit
international matches limited overs batsmen score quickly scoring quickly means trying score least ball bowled batsmen manage score average four runs four runs ball




ball reaches batsman left held high backlift stepping forward swinging forward drive right


team goes best players first first three batsmen number known order next four numbers possibly form middle order last four numbers lower order tail
specialist batsmen team usually near order score runs openers opening batsmen first batsmen take crease necessarily best batsmen expected negotiate ball lose wickets shine ball considerably diminished hard shiny ball bounces swings difficult batsmen face addition supposed play quick innings runs fewer balls reflecting fact fielding side subject restrictions placement fielders first overs makes easier score runs recent amendment rules cricket fielding captains given mandatory fielding restrictions first overs chunks overs also known powerplay overs impose stage choice within stipulated overs
following openers onedrop batsman take openers typically play careful prolonged innings effectively tying batting brings stability batting batsmen find difficult settle helps settled batsman best batsman team usually number protect difficulties batting best bowlers fresh pitch allow play long innings
middle order often considered valuable asset batting lineup oneday internationals members responsible consolidating batting teams position middle part overs characteristic middleorder batting practice taking many singles ones twos occasional boundary four opposed flamboyant openers score primarily boundaries fielding restrictions opposition lifted middle overs percentage boundaries scored decreases middleorder batsmen often chosen ability hard fast wickets maximise number runs scored boundaries endurance patience middle order typically sets stage aggressive assault bowling final overs match achieve assault things necessary number hardhitting batsmen number wickets hand since aggression means greater likelihood losing wickets last overs oneday cricket match innings often exciting part innings large number boundaries scored wickets taken last overs batsmen often shots riskier shots played beginning innings
examples risky shots include reverse sweep paddlescoop shots used achieve boundary would possible playing safer orthodox shot finally lower order consists bowlers team known batting prowess order possible
however real restrictions batting positions captains known experiment batting lineup gain specific advantages example lowerorder batsman sometimes sent number instructions pinchhit playing aggressively attempt score runs fewer balls term borrowed baseball score quick runs shield better players wicket less accomplished lowerorder batsman less valuable anyway
test cricketedit
test cricket usual score high total possible overs unlimited batsman take time score runs general overs bowled test match cricket openers starting batsmen test cricket often chosen sound technique ability defend wicket first hours innings especially begins morning usually characterised good conditions bowling specifically terms pace bounce pitch lateral movement ball
onedrop batsman usually also chosen sound technique stabilise case opener gets middle order batting team test matches usually includes skilled batsmen terms shotplaying ability middle overs batting relatively easier initial stages innings batting innings team begins last halfhour team might employ nightwatchman batsman gets
nightwatchman usually lowerorder batsman able protect wicket primarily defending dangerous balls leaving nondangerous ones rather looking produce large number runs team complete rabbit liable expose batsmen late move prevents regular batsman face last overs left early following morning however teams employ nightwatchmen various reasons including belief middleorder batsmen able protect wicket poor conditions well good lack defensively minded lowerorder batsmen
third innings batting team score quickly large target opposition scenario usually occurs fourth days play batting captain decides many overs prepared allow opposition chase total fourth innings usually declares teams innings predetermined time fourth bowl least overs overs last good number overs bowl opposition team fourth innings essential usually fourth fifth days test match conditions good bowling especially slow bowling pitch experienced fair degree wear tear thus make target difficult possible batting side speeds rate runs till captain declares
however batting team significantly behind opposition terms runs going fourth test match typical strategy batting team involves playing defensively avoid losing wickets ensures occupy time match draws close fifth teams innings fifth match drawn stalemate reached however trying said batting team manages overhaul deficit gain substantial lead excess runs opposition captain consider declaring innings force victory final depending size lead readiness bowlers state pitch
