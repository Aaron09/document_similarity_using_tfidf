computing source code collection computer instructions possibly comments written using humanreadable programming language usually plain text source code program specially designed facilitate work computer programmers specify actions performed computer mostly writing source code source code often transformed assembler compiler binary machine code understood computer machine code might stored execution later time alternatively source code interpreted thus immediately executed
application software distributed form includes executable files source code included would useful user programmer system administrator might wish study modify program

linux information project defines source code

source code also referred source code version software originally written typed computer human plain text human readable alphanumeric characters

notion source code also taken broadly include machine code notations graphical languages neither textual nature example article presented annual ieee conference source code analysis manipulation3

purpose clarity source code taken mean fully executable description software system therefore construed include machine code high level languages executable graphical representations systems4

often several steps program translation minification original source code typed human executable program like argue intermediate file real source code count source code5 others find convenient refer intermediate file source code next steps
historyedit
earliest programs storedprogram computers entered binary front panel switches computer firstgeneration programming language distinction source code machine code
first offered software work machine source code provided additional charge time cost developing supporting software included price hardware decades distributed source code software product licenses 19996
early computer magazines published source code typein programs
occasionally entire source code large program published hardback book computers typesetting program donald knuth source code internals philip zimmermann speedscript randy thompson µcos realtime kernel jean labrosse
organizationedit
source code constitutes program usually held text files stored computers hard disk usually files carefully arranged directory tree known source tree source code also stored database common stored procedures elsewhere




complex java source code example written objectoriented programming style demonstrates boilerplate code prologue comments indicated inline comments indicated green program statements indicated blue


source code particular piece software contained single file many files though practice uncommon programs source code written different programming languages7 example program written primarily programming language might portions written assembly language optimization purposes also possible components piece software written compiled separately arbitrary programming language later integrated software using technique called library linking languages java done time class compiled separate file linked interpreter runtime
another method make main program interpreter programming languagecitation needed either designed specifically application question generalpurpose write bulk actual user functionality macros forms addins language approach taken example emacs text editor
code base computer programming project larger collection source code computer programs make project become common practice maintain code bases version control systems moderately complex software customarily requires compilation assembly several sometimes dozens even hundreds different source code files cases instructions compilations makefile included source code describe programming relationships among source code files contain information compiled
revision control system another tool frequently used developers source code maintenance
purposesedit
source code primarily used input process produces executable program compiled interpreted also used method communicating algorithms people code snippets books8
computer programmers often find helpful review existing source code learn programming techniques8 sharing source code developers frequently cited contributing factor maturation programming skills8 people consider source code expressive artistic medium9
porting software computer platforms usually prohibitively difficult without source code without source code particular piece software portability generally computationally expensivecitation needed possible porting options include binary translation emulation original platform
decompilation executable program used generate source code either assembly code highlevel language
programmers frequently adapt source code piece software projects concept known software reusability
legal aspectsedit
also history free opensource software
situation varies worldwide united states 1974 software source code copyrightable therefore always public domain softwarecitation needed
1974 commission technological uses copyrighted works contu decided computer programs extent embody authors original creation proper subject matter copyright1011
1983 united states court case apple franklin ruled applied object code copyright gave computer programs copyright status literary works
1999 united states court case bernstein united states ruled source code could considered constitutionally protected form free speech proponents free speech argued source code conveys information programmers written language used share humor artistic pursuits protected form communication121314

author nontrivial work like software11 several exclusive rights among copyright source code object code16 author right possibility grant customers users software exclusive rights form software licensing software accompanying source code associated several licensing paradigms important distinction open source proprietary software done including copyright notice declares licensing terms notice found default rights reserved implied
generally speaking software open source source code free distribute modify study proprietary source code kept secret privately owned restricted first software licenses published explicitly grant freedoms general public license 1989 license another early example 1990
proprietary software provisions various copyright laws trade secrecy patents used keep source code closed additionally many pieces retail software come enduser license agreement eula typically prohibits decompilation reverse engineering analysis modification circumventing copy protection types source code protection—beyond traditional compilation object code—include code encryption code obfuscation code morphing
qualityedit
main article software quality
program written important consequences maintainers coding conventions stress readability languagespecific conventions aimed maintenance software source code involves debugging updating priorities speed programs execution ability compile program multiple architectures often make code readability less important consideration since code quality generally depends purpose
