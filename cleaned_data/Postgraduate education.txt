next several years doctoral candidate primarily performs research usually lasts three eight years though finish quickly take substantially longer total typical doctoral degree takes four eight years entering program completion though time varies depending upon department thesis topic many factors
example astronomy degrees take five years average observational astronomy degrees take seven limiting factors weather theoretical astronomy degrees take five though substantial variation among universities departments individuals humanities social science doctorates average take somewhat longer complete natural science doctorates differences differing nature research humanities social sciences natural sciences differing expectations discipline coursework languages length thesis however time required complete doctorate also varies according candidates abilities choice research students also choose remain program fail academic position particularly disciplines tight market remaining student retain access libraries university facilities also retaining academic affiliation essential conferences jobsearches
traditionally doctoral programs intended last three four years disciplines primarily natural sciences helpful advisor light teaching load possible degree completed amount time however increasingly many disciplines including humanities requirements coursework languages expected extent thesis research assumption students take five years minimum seven years average competition jobs within fields also raises expectations length quality theses considerably

departments often money limited discretionary funding supplement minor expenses research trips travel conferences
students attain outside fellowships national science foundation national physical science consortium npsc funding differs greatly departments universities universities give five years full funding students though often teaching requirement attached universities not23
foreign students typically funded domestic students although federally subsidized student parent loans workstudy assistance generally limited citizens nationals permanent residents approved refugees24 moreover funding sources many fellowships awarded domestic students factors contributing possible financial difficulties include high costs visit families back home supporting ones family allowed work immigration laws tuition steep world standards large fees visa fees citizenship immigration services surveillance fees student exchange visitor information systems sevis25 united states congress united states department homeland security
