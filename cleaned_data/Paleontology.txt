paleontology lies boundary biology geology since paleontology focuses record past life main source evidence fossils6 found rocks7 historical reasons paleontology part geology departments many universities 19th century early 20th century geology departments found paleontological evidence important estimating ages rocks biology departments showed little interest8
paleontology also overlap archaeology primarily works objects made humans human remains paleontologists interested characteristics evolution humans organisms dealing evidence humans archaeologists paleontologists work together example paleontologists might identify animal plant fossils around archaeological site discover people lived might analyze climate time site inhabited humans9
addition paleontology often uses techniques derived sciences including biology osteology ecology chemistry physics mathematics2 example geochemical signatures rocks help discover life first arose earth10 analyses carbon isotope ratios help identify climate changes even explain major transitions permian–triassic extinction event11 relatively recent discipline molecular phylogenetics often helps using comparisons different modern organisms reconstruct evolutionary family trees also used estimate dates important evolutionary developments although approach controversial doubts reliability molecular clock12 techniques developed engineering used analyse ancient organisms might worked example fast tyrannosaurus could move powerful bite was1314 relatively commonplace study fossils using xray microtomography15 combination paleontology biology archaeology paleoneurobiology study endocranial casts endocasts species related humans learn evolution human brains16
paleontology even contributes astrobiology investigation possible life planets developing models life arisen providing techniques detecting evidence life17
subdivisionsedit

analyses using engineering techniques show tyrannosaurus devastating bite raise doubts fast could move


instead focusing individual organisms paleoecology examines interactions different organisms places food chains twoway interaction organisms environment20 example development oxygenic photosynthesis bacteria hugely increased productivity diversity ecosystems21 also caused oxygenation atmosphere together prerequisite evolution complex eukaryotic cells multicellular organisms built22
paleoclimatology although sometimes treated part paleoecology19 focuses history earths climate mechanisms changed it23 sometimes included evolutionary developments example rapid expansion land plants devonian period removed carbon dioxide atmosphere reducing greenhouse effect thus helping cause carboniferous period24
biostratigraphy fossils work chronological order rocks formed useful paleontologists geologists25 biogeography studies spatial distribution organisms also linked geology explains earths geography changed time26

occasionally unusual environments preserve soft tissues lagerstätten allow paleontologists examine internal anatomy animals sediments represented shells spines claws preserved however even lagerstätten present incomplete picture life time majority organisms living time probably represented lagerstätten restricted narrow range environments softbodied organisms preserved quickly events mudslides exceptional events cause quick burial make difficult study normal environments animals31 sparseness fossil record means organisms expected exist long found fossil record known signorlipps effect32

levels linnaean taxonomy


naming groups organisms clear widely agreed important disputes paleontology based misunderstandings names37 linnaean taxonomy commonly used classifying living organisms runs difficulties dealing newly discovered organisms significantly different known ones example hard decide level place higherlevel grouping genus family order important since linnaean rules naming groups tied levels hence group moved different level must renamed38
paleontologists generally approaches based cladistics technique working evolutionary family tree organisms37 works logic groups similarities either group closely related either characters compared anatomical presence notochord molecular comparing sequences proteins result successful analysis hierarchy clades groups share common ancestor ideally family tree branches leading node junction sometimes little information achieve paleontologists make junctions several branches cladistic technique sometimes fallible features wings camera eyes evolved convergently must taken account analyses36

common index fossils used date rocks northeast


paleontology seeks living things changed time substantial hurdle difficulty working fossils beds preserve fossils typically lack radioactive elements needed radiometric dating technique means giving rocks greater million years absolute accurate within better41 although radiometric dating requires careful laboratory work basic principle simple rates various radioactive elements decay known ratio radioactive element element decays shows long radioactive element incorporated rock radioactive elements common rocks volcanic origin fossilbearing rocks dated radiometrically volcanic layers41
consequently paleontologists must usually rely stratigraphy date fossils stratigraphy science deciphering layercake sedimentary record compared jigsaw puzzle42 rocks normally form relatively horizontal layers layer younger underneath fossil found layers whose ages known fossils must known ages43 rock sequences continuous broken faults periods erosion difficult match rock beds directly next another however fossils species survived relatively short time used link isolated rocks technique called biostratigraphy instance conodont eoplacognathus pseudoplanus short range middle ordovician period44 rocks unknown found traces pseudoplanus must midordovician index fossils must distinctive globally distributed short time range useful however misleading results produced index fossils turn longer fossil ranges first thought45 stratigraphy biostratigraphy general provide relative dating often sufficient studying evolution however difficult time periods problems involved matching rocks across different continents46
familytree relationships also help narrow date lineages first appeared instance fossils date million years calculated family tree says ancestor must evolved million years
also possible estimate long living clades diverged approximately long last common ancestor must lived assuming mutations accumulate constant rate molecular clocks however fallible provide approximate timing example sufficiently precise reliable estimating groups feature cambrian explosion first evolved47 estimates produced different techniques vary factor two12
