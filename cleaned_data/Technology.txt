optimism
also extropianism

luddites smashing power loom 1812


somewhat skeptical side certain philosophers like herbert marcuse john zerzan believe technological societies inherently flawed suggest inevitable result society become evermore technological cost freedom psychological health
many luddites prominent philosopher martin heidegger hold serious although entirely deterministic reservations technology question concerning technology61 according heidegger scholars hubert dreyfus charles spinosa heidegger oppose technology hopes reveal essence technology confines stultified compulsion push blindly technology comes thing rebel helplessly indeed promises open expressly essence technology find unexpectedly taken freeing claim62 entails complex relationship technology either technooptimists technopessimists tend allow63
poignant criticisms technology found considered dystopian literary classics aldous huxleys brave world anthony burgesss clockwork orange george orwells nineteen eightyfour goethes faust faust selling soul devil return power physical world also often interpreted metaphor adoption industrial technology recently modern works science fiction philip dick william gibson films blade runner ghost shell project highly ambivalent cautionary attitudes toward technologys impact human society identity
late cultural critic neil postman distinguished toolusing societies technological societies called technopolies societies dominated ideology technological scientific progress exclusion harm cultural practices values worldviews64
darin barney written technologys impact practices citizenship democratic culture suggesting technology construed object political debate means medium discussion setting democratic deliberation citizenship setting democratic culture barney suggests technology tends make ethical questions including question good life consists nearly impossible already give answer question good life includes technology65
nikolas kompridis also written dangers technology genetic engineering nanotechnology synthetic biology robotics warns technologies introduce unprecedented challenges human beings including possibility permanent alteration biological nature concerns shared philosophers scientists public intellectuals written similar issues francis fukuyama jürgen habermas william michael sandel66
another prominent critic technology hubert dreyfus published books internet computers still cant
infamous antitechnological treatise industrial society future written unabomber kaczynski printed several major newspapers later books part effort bombing campaign technoindustrial infrastructure
appropriate technology
also technocriticism technorealism
notion appropriate technology developed 20th century thinkers schumacher jacques ellul describe situations desirable technologies required access centralized infrastructure parts skills imported elsewhere ecovillage movement emerged part concern
optimism skepticism 21st century
section mainly focuses american concerns even reasonably generalized western countries

inadequate quantity quality american jobs fundamental economic challenges face whats linkage technology fundamental problem
bernstein jared it’s skills that’s holding wages it’s weak economy among things american prospect october 2014

article jared bernstein senior fellow center budget policy priorities67 questions widespread idea automation broadly technological advances mainly contributed growing labor market problem thesis appears third optimism skepticism essentially stands neutral approach linkage technology american issues concerning unemployment declining wages
uses main arguments defend point first recent technological advances increasing number workers losing jobs scientific evidence fails clearly demonstrate technology displaced many workers created problems solved indeed automation threatens repetitive jobs higherend jobs still necessary complement technology manual jobs requires flexibility judgment common sense68 remain hard replace machines second studies shown clear links recent technology advances wage trends last decades
therefore according bernstein instead focusing technology hypothetical influences current american increasing unemployment declining wages needs worry policy fails offset imbalances demand trade income opportunity68

people internet mobile devices excessive quantities likely experience fatigue exhaustion result disruptions sleeping patterns continuous studies shown increased weight gain associated people spend long hours online exercising frequently heavy internet also displayed school lower grades excessive amounts also noted mobile phones whilst driving increased occurrence road accidents particularly amongst teen drivers statistically teens reportedly fourfold amount road traffic incidents years older high percentage adolescents write read texts driving71 context mass media technology negative impact people mental physical health
complex technological systems
thomas hughes stated technology considered solve problems need aware complex varied characters efficiently72 difference wheel compass cooking machines oven stove consider part none technologies
technology often considered narrowly according hughes technology creative process involving human ingenuity73 definitions emphasis creativity avoids unbounded definitions mistakenly include cooking “technologies also highlights prominent role humans therefore responsibilities complex technological systems
technology everywhere dramatically changed landscapes societies hughes argues engineers scientists managers often believed technology shape world want often supposed technology easily controllable assumption thoroughly questioned72 instance evgeny morozov particularly challenges concepts “internetcentrism” “solutionism74 internetcentrism refers idea society convinced internet stable coherent forces solutionism ideology every social issue solved thanks technology especially thanks internet fact technology intrinsically contains uncertainties limitations according alexis madrigals review morozovs theory ignore lead “unexpected consequences could eventually cause damage problems seek address75 benjamin cohen gwen ottinger also discussed multivalent effects technology76
therefore recognition limitations technology broadly scientific knowledge needed especially cases dealing environmental justice health issues ottinger continues reasoning argues ongoing recognition limitations scientific knowledge goes hand hand scientists engineers’ comprehension role approach technology science require technical professionals conceive roles process differently consider collaborators research problem solving rather simply providers information technical solutions77
competitiveness
technology properly defined application science accomplish function science leading edge well established function high visibility significantly mundane technology exploitation foundation competitive advantage
technologybased planning used build industrial giants wwii dupont used transform superpower economicbased planning
animal species
also tool animals structures built animals ecosystem engineer




adult gorilla uses branch walking stick gauge waters depth example technology usage nonhuman primates


basic technology also feature animal species apart humans include primates chimpanzees78 dolphin communities79 crows8081 considering generic perspective technology ethology active environmental conditioning control also refer animal examples beavers dams bees honeycombs
ability make tools considered defining characteristic genus homo82 however discovery tool construction among chimpanzees related primates discarded notion technology unique humans example researchers observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools foraging tools used include leaf sponges termite fishing probes pestles levers83 west african chimpanzees also stone hammers anvils cracking nuts84 capuchin monkeys vista brazil85
future technology
main article emerging technologies
theories technology often attempt predict future technology based high technology science time predictions future however technologys uncertain
2005 futurist kurzweil predicted future technology would mainly consist overlapping revolution genetics nanotechnology robotics robotics important three86
