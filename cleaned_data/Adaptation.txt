historyedit
main article history evolutionary thought
adaptation observable fact life accepted philosophers natural historians ancient times independently views evolution explanations differed empedocles believe adaptation required final cause purpose came naturally since things survived aristotle believe final causes assumed species fixed
natural theology adaptation interpreted work deity evidence existence god1 william paley believed organisms perfectly adapted lives argument shadowed gottfried wilhelm leibniz argued brought best possible worlds voltaires pangloss2 parody optimistic idea david hume also argued design3 bridgewater treatises product natural theology though authors managed present work fairly neutral manner series lampooned robert knox held quasievolutionary views bilgewater treatises charles darwin broke tradition emphasising flaws limitations occurred animal plant worlds4
lamarckism protoevolutionary hypothesis inheritance acquired characteristics whose main purpose explain adaptations natural means5 jeanbaptiste lamarck proposed tendency organisms become complex moving ladder progress plus influence circumstances usually expressed disuse6
natural historians buffon accepted adaptation also accepted evolution without voicing opinions mechanism illustrates real merit darwin alfred russel wallace secondary figures henry walter bates putting forward mechanism whose significance glimpsed previously century later experimental field studies breeding experiments people ford theodosius dobzhansky produced evidence natural selection engine behind adaptation much stronger force previously thought789

adaptation isedit
adaptation primarily process rather physical form part body11 internal parasite liver fluke illustrate distinction parasite simple bodily structure nevertheless organism highly adapted specific environment adaptation matter visible traits parasites critical adaptations take place life cycle often quite complex12 however practical term adaptation often refers product features species result process many aspects animal plant correctly called adaptations though always features whose function remains doubt using term adaptation evolutionary process adaptive trait bodily part function product distinguish different senses word13141516
adaptation main processes explain observed diversity species different species darwins finches process speciation species arise typically reproductive isolation1718 favorite example used today study interplay adaptation speciation evolution cichlid fish african lakes question reproductive isolation complex1920
adaptation always simple matter ideal phenotype evolves given external environment organism must viable stages development stages evolution places constraints evolution development behavior structure organisms main constraint much debate requirement genetic phenotypic change evolution relatively small developmental systems complex interlinked however clear relatively small mean example polyploidy plants reasonably common large genetic change21 origin eukaryotic symbiosis dramatic example22
