areas world subtropical climates according köppen climate classification


subtropics geographic climate zones located roughly tropics latitude 235° tropic cancer tropic capricorn temperate zones normally referring latitudes 35–665° north south equator
subtropical climates often characterized warm summers cool mild winters infrequent frost subtropical climates fall basic types humid subtropical rainfall often concentrated warmest months example brisbane queensland jacksonville florida summer mediterranean seasonal rainfall concentrated cooler months example naples italy angeles california
subtropical climates occur high elevations within tropics southern mexican plateau vietnam taiwan climate classifications term help define various temperature precipitation regimes planet earth
great portion worlds deserts located within subtropics development subtropical ridge within savanna regimes subtropics season seen annually summer yearly rainfall falls within mediterranean climate regimes season occurs winter areas bordering warm oceans prone locally heavy rainfall tropical cyclones contribute significant percentage annual rainfall plants palms citrus mango pistachio lychee avocado grown within subtropics
