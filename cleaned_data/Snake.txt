skin
main article snake scales
skin snake covered scales contrary popular notion snakes slimy possible confusion snakes worms snakeskin smooth texture snakes specialized belly scales travel gripping surfaces body scales smooth keeled granular eyelids snake transparent spectacle scales remain permanently closed also known brille
shedding scales called ecdysis normal usage molting sloughing case snakes complete outer layer skin shed layer41 snake scales discrete extensions epidermis—hence shed separately complete outer layer molt akin sock turned inside out42
shape number scales head back belly often characteristic used taxonomic purposes scales named mainly according positions body advanced caenophidian snakes broad belly scales rows dorsal scales correspond vertebrae allowing scientists count vertebrae without dissection
molting




snake shedding skin


molting ecdysis serves number functions firstly worn skin replaced secondly helps parasites mites ticks renewal skin moulting supposed allow growth animals insects however disputed case snakes4243
molting occurs periodically throughout snakes life molt snake stops eating often hides moves safe place shedding skin becomes dull looking eyes become cloudy bluecolored inner surface skin liquefies causes skin separate skin beneath days eyes clear snake crawls skin skin breaks near mouth snake wriggles aided rubbing rough surfaces many cases cast skin peels backward body head tail piece like pulling sock insideout larger brighter layer skin formed underneath4244
older snake shed skin twice year younger snake still growing shed four times year44 discarded skin gives perfect imprint scale pattern usually possible identify snake discarded skin reasonably intact42 periodic renewal snake symbol healing medicine pictured asclepius45

skeleton




compared skeletons snakes radically different reptiles turtle right made almost entirely extended ribcage


skeleton snakes consists solely skull hyoid vertebral column ribs though henophidian snakes retain vestiges pelvis rear limbs
skull snake consists solid complete neurocranium many bones loosely attached particularly highly mobile bones facilitate manipulation ingestion large prey items left right sides lower joined flexible ligament anterior tips allowing separate widely posterior lower bones articulate quadrate bone allowing mobility bones mandible quadrate bones also pick ground borne vibrations47 sides move independently another snakes resting jaws surface sensitive stereo hearing detect position prey jawquadratestapes pathway capable detecting vibrations angstrom scale despite absence outer ossicle mechanism impedance matching used vertebrates receive vibrations air4849
hyoid small bone located posterior ventral skull neck region serves attachment muscles snakes tongue tetrapods
vertebral column consists anywhere vertebrae tail vertebrae comparatively number often less total lack ribs body vertebrae ribs articulating vertebrae projections allow strong muscle attachment enabling locomotion without limbs

reproduction
also sexual selection scaled reptiles
although wide range reproductive modes used snakes snakes employ internal fertilization accomplished means paired forked hemipenes stored inverted males tail59 hemipenes often grooved hooked spined order grip walls females cloaca59
species snakes eggs abandon shortly laying however species king cobra actually construct nests stay vicinity hatchlings incubation59 pythons coil around eggclutches remain hatch60 female python leave eggs except occasionally bask drink water even shiver generate heat incubate eggs60
species snake ovoviviparous retain eggs within bodies almost ready hatch6162 recently confirmed several species snake fully viviparous constrictor green anaconda nourishing young placenta well yolk highly unusual among reptiles anything else outside requiem sharks placental mammals6162 retention eggs live birth often associated colder environments5962




garter snake studied sexual selection


sexual selection snakes demonstrated three thousand species different tactics acquiring mates63 ritual combat males females want mate includes topping behavior exhibited viperids male twist around vertically elevated fore body opponent forcing downward common neck biting occur snakes entwined64
facultative parthenogenesis
parthenogenesis natural form reproduction growth development embryos occur without fertilization agkistrodon contortrix copperhead agkistrodon piscivorus cotton mouth reproduce facultative parthenogenesis capable switching sexual mode reproduction asexual mode65 type parthenogenesis likely occurs automixis terminal fusion process terminal products meiosis fuse form diploid zygote process leads genome wide homozygosity expression deleterious recessive alleles often developmental abnormalities captiveborn wildborn contortrix piscivorus appear capable form parthenogenesis65
reproduction squamate reptiles almost exclusively sexual males ordinarily pair determining chromosomes females pair however colombian rainbow epicrates maurus also reproduce facultative parthenogenesis resulting production female progeny66 females likely produced terminal automixis
