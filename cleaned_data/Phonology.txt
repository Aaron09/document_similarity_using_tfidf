phonology branch linguistics concerned systematic organization sounds languages traditionally focused largely study systems phonemes particular languages therefore used also called phonemics phonematics also cover linguistic analysis either level beneath word including syllable onset rime articulatory gestures articulatory features mora levels language sound considered structured conveying linguistic meaning
phonology also includes study equivalent nonoral languages sign languages

early evidence systematic study sounds language appears century ashtadhyayi sanskrit grammar composed pāṇini particular shiva sutras auxiliary text ashtadhyayi introduces considered list phonemes sanskrit language notational system used throughout main text deals matters morphology syntax semantics
study phonology exists today defined formative studies 19thcentury polish scholar baudouin courtenay together students mikołaj kruszewski shcherba shaped modern usage term phoneme series lectures 18761877 word phoneme coined years earlier 1873 french linguist dufrichedesgenettes paper read 24th meeting société linguistique paris5 dufrichedesgenettes proposed phoneme serve oneword equivalent german sprachlaut6 baudouin courtenays subsequent work though often unacknowledged considered starting point modern phonology also worked theory phonetic alternations called allophony morphophonology influence work saussure according koerner7




nikolai trubetzkoy 1920s


influential school phonology interwar period prague school leading members prince nikolai trubetzkoy whose grundzüge phonologie principles phonology3 published posthumously 1939 among important works field period directly influenced baudouin courtenay trubetzkoy considered founder morphophonology although concept also recognized courtenay trubetzkoy also developed concept archiphoneme another important figure prague school roman jakobson prominent linguists 20th century
1968 noam chomsky morris halle published sound pattern english basis generative phonology view phonological representations sequences segments made distinctive features features expansion earlier work roman jakobson gunnar fant morris halle features describe aspects articulation perception universally fixed binary values least levels representation underlying representation surface phonetic representation ordered phonological rules govern underlying representation transformed actual pronunciation socalled surface form important consequence influence phonological theory downplaying syllable emphasis segments furthermore generativists folded morphophonology phonology solved created problems
natural phonology theory based publications proponent david stampe 1969 explicitly 1979 view phonology based universal phonological processes interact another ones active suppressed languagespecific rather acting segments phonological processes distinctive features within prosodic groups prosodic groups small part syllable large entire utterance phonological processes unordered respect apply simultaneously though output process input another second prominent natural phonologist patricia donegan stampes wife many natural phonologists europe geoffrey nathan principles natural phonology extended morphology wolfgang dressler founded natural morphology
1976 john goldsmith introduced autosegmental phonology phonological phenomena longer seen operating linear sequence segments called phonemes feature combinations rather involving parallel sequences features reside multiple tiers autosegmental phonology later evolved feature geometry became standard theory representation theories organization phonology different lexical phonology optimality theory
government phonology originated early 1980s attempt unify theoretical notions syntactic phonological structures based notion languages necessarily follow small principles vary according selection certain binary parameters languages phonological structures essentially restricted variation accounts differences surface realizations principles held inviolable though parameters sometimes come conflict prominent figures field include jonathan kaye jean lowenstamm jeanroger vergnaud monik charette john harris
course summer institute 1991 alan prince paul smolensky developed optimality theory—an overall architecture phonology according languages choose pronunciation word best satisfies list constraints ordered importance lowerranked constraint violated violation necessary order obey higherranked constraint approach soon extended morphology john mccarthy alan prince become dominant trend phonology appeal phonetic grounding constraints representational elements features various approaches criticized proponents substancefree phonology especially mark hale charles reiss89
integrated approach phonological theory combines synchronic diachronic accounts sound patterns initiated evolutionary phonology recent years10
analysis phonemesedit
important part traditional pregenerative schools phonology studying sounds grouped distinctive units within language units known phonemes example english sound aspirated pronounced spot aspirated pronounced however english speakers intuitively treat sounds variations allophones phonological category phoneme traditionally would argued aspirated interchanged unaspirated spot native speakers english would still hear words sounds perceived languages however sounds perceived different consequently assigned different phonemes example thai hindi quechua minimal pairs words aspiration contrasting feature words different meanings difference pronunciation aspirated sound unaspirated




vowels modern standard arabic israeli hebrew phonemic point view note intersection circles—the distinction short made speakers arabic lacks articulation short vowels hebrew lacks distinction vowel length






vowels modern standard arabic israeli hebrew phonetic point view note circles totally separate—none vowelsounds made speakers language made speakers


part phonological study language therefore involves looking data phonetic transcriptions speech native speakers trying deduce underlying phonemes sound inventory language presence absence minimal pairs mentioned frequently used criterion deciding whether sounds assigned phoneme however considerations often need taken account well
particular contrasts phonemic language change time time sounds place manner articulation differ voicing allophones phoneme english later came belong separate phonemes main factors historical change languages described historical linguistics
findings insights speech perception articulation research complicate traditional somewhat intuitive idea interchangeable allophones perceived phoneme first interchanged allophones phoneme result unrecognizable words second actual speech even word level highly coarticulated problematic expect able splice words simple segments without affecting speech perception
different linguists therefore take different approaches problem assigning sounds phonemes example differ extent require allophones phonetically similar also differing ideas whether grouping sounds purely tool linguistic analysis reflects actual process human brain processes language
since early 1960s theoretical linguists moved away traditional concept phoneme preferring consider basic units abstract level component morphemes units called morphophonemes analysis using approach called morphophonology
topics phonologyedit
addition minimal units serve purpose differentiating meaning phonemes phonology studies sounds alternate replace another different forms morpheme allomorphs well example syllable structure stress feature geometry accent intonation
phonology also includes topics phonotactics phonological constraints sounds appear positions given language phonological alternation pronunciation sound changes application phonological rules sometimes given order feeding bleeding11 well prosody study suprasegmentals topics stress intonation
principles phonological analysis applied independently modality designed serve general analytical tools languagespecific ones principles applied analysis sign languages phonemes sign languages even though sublexical units instantiated speech sounds
