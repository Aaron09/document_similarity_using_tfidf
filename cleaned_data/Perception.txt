perception latin perceptio organization identification interpretation sensory information order represent understand presented information environment1
perception involves signals nervous system turn result physical chemical stimulation sensory system2 example vision involves light striking retina smell mediated odor molecules hearing involves pressure waves
perception passive receipt signals also shaped recipients learning memory expectation attention34
perception split processes processing sensory input transforms lowlevel information higherlevel information extracts shapes object recognition processing connected persons concepts expectations knowledge restorative selective mechanisms attention influence perception
perception depends complex functions nervous system subjectively seems mostly effortless processing happens outside conscious awareness
since rise experimental psychology 19th century psychologys understanding perception progressed combining variety techniques psychophysics quantitatively describes relationships physical qualities sensory input perception5 sensory neuroscience studies brain mechanisms underlying perception perceptual systems also studied computationally terms information process perceptual issues philosophy include extent sensory qualities sound smell color exist objective reality rather mind perceiver3
although senses traditionally viewed passive receptors study illusions ambiguous images demonstrated brains perceptual systems actively preconsciously attempt make sense input3 still active debate extent perception active process hypothesis testing analogous science whether realistic sensory information rich enough make process unnecessary3
perceptual systems brain enable individuals world around stable even though sensory information typically incomplete rapidly varying human animal brains structured modular different areas processing different kinds sensory information modules take form sensory maps mapping aspect world across part brains surface different modules interconnected influence instance taste strongly influenced smell6

process terminologyedit
process perception begins object real world termed distal stimulus distal object2 means light sound another physical process object stimulates bodys sensory organs sensory organs transform input energy neural activity—a process called transduction27 pattern neural activity called proximal stimulus2 neural signals transmitted brain processed2 resulting mental recreation distal stimulus percept
example would shoe shoe distal stimulus light shoe enters persons stimulates retina stimulation proximal stimulus8 image shoe reconstructed brain person percept another example would telephone ringing ringing telephone distal stimulus sound stimulating persons auditory receptors proximal stimulus brains interpretation ringing telephone percept different kinds sensation warmth sound taste called sensory modalities79
psychologist jerome bruner developed model perception according people following process form opinions10

encounter unfamiliar target open different informational cues want learn target
second step collect information target gradually encounter familiar cues help categorize target
stage cues become less open selective search cues confirm categorization target also actively ignore even distort cues violate initial perceptions perception becomes selective finally paint consistent picture target

according alan saks gary johns three components perception10

perceiver person becomes aware something comes final understanding factors influence perceptions experience motivational state finally emotional state different motivational emotional states perceiver react perceive something different ways also different situations might employ perceptual defence tend want
target person perceived judged ambiguity lack information target leads greater need interpretation addition
situation also greatly influences perceptions different situations call additional information target

stimuli necessarily translated percept rarely single stimulus translate percept ambiguous stimulus translated multiple percepts experienced randomly time called multistable perception stimuli absence result different percepts depending subjects culture previous experiences ambiguous figures demonstrate single stimulus result percept example rubin vase interpreted either vase faces percept bind sensations multiple senses whole picture talking person television screen example bound sound speech speakers form percept talking person percept also term used leibniz11 bergson deleuze guattari12 define perception independent perceivers
realityedit
case visual perception people actually percept shift minds eye13 others picture thinkers necessarily perceive shapeshifting world changes esemplastic nature shown experiment ambiguous image multiple interpretations perceptual level
confusing ambiguity perception exploited human technologies camouflage also biological mimicry example european peacock butterflies whose wings bear eyespots birds respond though eyes dangerous predator
also evidence brain ways operates slight delay allow nerve impulses distant parts body integrated simultaneous signals14
perception oldest fields psychology oldest quantitative laws psychology webers states smallest noticeable difference stimulus intensity proportional intensity reference fechners quantifies relationship intensity physical stimulus perceptual counterpart example testing much darker computer screen viewer actually notices study perception gave rise gestalt school psychology emphasis holistic approach

constancyedit
main article subjective constancy
perceptual constancy ability perceptual systems recognize object widely varying sensory inputs4118–12015 example individual people recognized views frontal profile form different shapes retina coin looked faceon makes circular image retina held angle makes elliptical image16 normal perception recognized single threedimensional object without correction process animal approaching distance would appear gain size1718 kind perceptual constancy color constancy example white piece paper recognized different colors intensities light18 another example roughness constancy hand drawn quickly across surface touch nerves stimulated intensely brain compensates speed contact affect perceived roughness18 constancies include melody odor brightness words19 constancies always total variation percept much less variation physical stimulus18 perceptual systems brain achieve perceptual constancy variety ways specialized kind information processed20 phonemic restoration notable example hearing
groupingedit
main article principles grouping




closure human brain tends perceive complete shapes even forms incomplete


principles grouping gestalt laws grouping principles psychology first proposed gestalt psychologists explain humans naturally perceive objects organized patterns objects gestalt psychologists argued principles exist mind innate disposition perceive patterns stimulus based certain rules principles organized categories proximity similarity closure good continuation common fate good form
principle proximity states else equal perception tends group stimuli close together part object stimuli apart separate objects principle similarity states else equal perception lends seeing stimuli physically resemble part object stimuli different part different object allows people distinguish adjacent overlapping objects based visual texture resemblance principle closure refers minds tendency complete figures forms even picture incomplete partially hidden objects part information needed make complete picture minds missing example part shapes border missing people still tend shape completely enclosed border ignore gaps principle good continuation makes sense stimuli overlap intersection objects people tend perceive single uninterrupted object principle common fate groups stimuli together basis movement visual elements seen moving direction rate perception associates movement part stimulus allows people make moving objects even details color outline obscured principle good form refers tendency group together forms similar shape pattern color etc21222324 later research identified additional grouping principles25
contrast effectsedit
main article contrast effect
common finding across many different kinds perception perceived qualities object affected qualities context object extreme dimension neighboring objects perceived away extreme simultaneous contrast effect term used stimuli presented time whereas successive contrast applies stimuli presented another26
contrast effect noted 17th century philosopher john locke observed lukewarm water feel cold depending whether hand touching previously cold water27 early 20th century wilhelm wundt identified contrast fundamental principle perception since effect confirmed many different areas27 effects shape visual qualities like color brightness kinds perception including heavy object feels28 experiment found thinking name hitler subjects rating person hostile29 whether piece music perceived good depend whether music heard pleasant unpleasant30 effect work objects compared need similar television reporter seem smaller interviewing tall basketball player standing next tall building28 brain brightness contrast exerts effects neuronal firing rates neuronal synchrony31
effect experienceedit
main article perceptual learning
experience organisms learn make finer perceptual distinctions learn kinds categorization winetasting reading xray images music appreciation applications process human sphere research focused relation kinds learning whether takes place peripheral sensory systems brains processing sense information32 empirical research show specific practices yoga mindfulness meditation daoshi mindbody disciplines modify human perceptual modality specifically practices enable perception skills switch external exteroceptive field towards higher ability focus internal signals proprioception also asked provide verticality judgments highly selftranscendent yoga practitioners significantly less influenced misleading visual context increasing selftranscendence enable yoga practitioners optimize verticality judgment tasks relying internal vestibular proprioceptive signals coming body rather exteroceptive visual cues33
effect motivation expectationedit
main article psychology
perceptual also called perceptual expectancy predisposition perceive things certain way34 example perception shaped topdown processes drives expectations35 perceptual sets occur different senses17 long term special sensitivity hearing ones name crowded room short term ease hungry people notice smell food36 simple demonstration effect involved brief presentations nonwords sael subjects told expect words animals read seal others expecting boatrelated words read sail36
sets created motivation result people interpreting ambiguous figures want see35 instance someone perceives unfolds sports game biased strongly support teams37 experiment students allocated pleasant unpleasant tasks computer told either number letter would flash screen whether going taste orange juice drink unpleasanttasting health drink fact ambiguous figure flashed screen could either read letter number letters associated pleasant task subjects likely perceive letter letters associated unpleasant task tended perceive number 1334
perceptual demonstrated many social contexts people primed think someone warm likely perceive variety positive characteristics word warm replaced cold someone reputation funny audience likely find amusing36 individuals perceptual sets reflect personality traits example people aggressive personality quicker correctly identify aggressive words situations36
classic psychological experiment showed slower reaction times less accurate answers deck playing cards reversed color suit symbol cards spades black hearts38
philosopher andy clark explains perception although occurs quickly simply bottomup process minute details together form larger wholes instead brains calls predictive coding starts broad constraints expectations state world expectations makes detailed predictions errors lead predictions learning processes clark says research various implications completely unbiased unfiltered perception means great deal feedback perception expectation perceptual experiences often shape beliefs perceptions based existing beliefs39 indeed predictive coding provides account type feedback assists stabilizing inferencemaking process physical world perceptual constancy examples

evolutionary psychology perceptionedit
many philosophers jerry fodor write purpose perception knowledge evolutionary psychologists hold primary purpose guide action46 example depth perception seems evolved help know distances objects rather help move around space46 evolutionary psychologists animals fiddler crabs humans eyesight collision avoidance suggesting vision basically directing action providing knowledge46
building maintaining sense organs metabolically expensive organs evolve improve organisms fitness46 half brain devoted processing sensory information brain consumes roughly onefourth ones metabolic resources senses must provide exceptional benefits fitness46 perception accurately mirrors world animals useful accurate information senses46
scientists study perception sensation long understood human senses adaptations46 depth perception consists processing half dozen visual cues based regularity physical world46 vision evolved respond narrow range electromagnetic energy plentiful pass objects46 sound waves provide useful information sources distances objects larger animals making hearing lowerfrequency sounds smaller animals making hearing higherfrequency sounds46 taste smell respond chemicals environment significant fitness environment evolutionary adaptedness46 sense touch actually many senses including pressure heat cold tickle pain46 pain unpleasant adaptive46 important adaptation senses range shifting organism becomes temporarily less sensitive sensation46 example ones eyes automatically adjust bright ambient light46 sensory abilities different organisms often coevolve case hearing echolocating bats moths evolved respond sounds bats make46
evolutionary psychologists claim perception demonstrates principle modularity specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks46 example people damage particular part brain suffer specific defect able recognize faces prospagnosia46 suggests indicates socalled facereading module46
