typesedit
words homozygous heterozygous hemizygous used describe genotype diploid organism single locus homozygous describes genotype consisting identical alleles given locus heterozygous describes genotype consisting different alleles locus hemizygous describes genotype consisting single copy particular gene otherwise diploid organism nullizygous refers otherwisediploid organism copies gene missing
homozygousedit
cell said homozygous particular gene identical alleles gene present homologous chromosomes2 cell organism question called homozygote true breeding organisms always homozygous traits held constant
individual homozygousdominant particular trait carries copies allele codes dominant trait allele often called dominant allele normally represented capital letter dominant allele producing purple flowers plants organism homozygousdominant particular trait genotype represented doubling symbol trait
individual homozygousrecessive particular trait carries copies allele codes recessive trait allele often called recessive allele usually represented lowercase form letter used corresponding dominant trait reference example recessive allele producing white flowers plants genotype organism homozygousrecessive particular trait represented doubling appropriate letter
heterozygousedit
diploid organism heterozygous gene locus cells contain different alleles gene3 cell organism called heterozygote specifically allele question therefore heterozygosity refers specific genotype heterozygous genotypes represented capital letter representing dominant allele lowercase letter representing recessive allele alternatively heterozygote gene assumed capital letter usually written first
trait question determined simple complete dominance heterozygote express trait coded dominant allele trait coded recessive allele present complex dominance schemes results heterozygosity complex
hemizygousedit
chromosome diploid organism hemizygous copy present2 cell organism called hemizygote hemizygosity also observed copy gene deleted heterogametic gene located chromosome hemizygosity must confused haploinsufficiency describes mechanism producing phenotype organisms male heterogametic humans almost xlinked genes hemizygous males normal chromosomes chromosome genes chromosome transgenic mice generated exogenous microinjection embryos pronucleus also considered hemizygous introduced allele expected incorporated copy locus transgenic later bred homozygosity maintained inbred line reduce need confirm genotypes litter
cultured mammalian cells chinese hamster ovary cell line number genetic loci present functional hemizygous state mutations deletions alleles4
nullizygousedit
nullizygous organism carries mutant alleles gene mutant alleles complete lossoffunction null alleles homozygous null nullizygous synonymous2 mutant cell organism called nullizygote
autozygous allozygousedit
zygosity also refer origins alleles genotype alleles locus originate common ancestor nonrandom mating inbreeding genotype said autozygous also known identical descent alleles come different sources least extent descent traced genotype called allozygous known identical state ibsclarification needed
alleles autozygous genotypes come source always homozygous allozygous genotypes homozygous heterozygous genotypes often necessarily allozygous different alleles arisen mutation time common origin hemizygous nullizygous genotypes contain enough alleles allow comparison sources classification irrelevant
monozygotic dizygotic twinsedit
details terms monozygotic dizygotic twin
discussed zygosity used context specific genetic locus example5 addition word zygosity also used describe genetic similarity dissimilarity twins6 identical twins monozygotic meaning develop zygote splits forms embryos fraternal twins dizygotic develop separate eggs fertilized separate sperm
