defense treaty soviet threat
united states attempting erect alliance form middle east defense organization keep soviet union near east tried nasser alliance41 central problem american policy middle east region perceived strategically important united states weighed defense commitments europe east lacked sufficient troops resist soviet invasion middle east42 1952 general omar bradley joint chiefs staff declared planning session event soviet invasion near east staff come take stuff there42
consequence american diplomats favoured creation natotype organization near east provide necessary military power deter soviets invading region42 eisenhower administration even truman administration near east huge soviet influence could projected accordingly required americansupported security system43 american diplomat raymond hare later recalled

hard back period really definite fear hostilities active russian occupation middle east physically practically hear russian boots clumping desert sands44

projected middle east defense organization medo centered egypt44 national security council directive march 1953 called egypt near east advised washington develop egypt point strength43
major dilemma american policy strongest powers near east britain france also nations whose influence many local nationalists resented42 1953 onwards american diplomacy attempted unsuccessfully persuade powers involved near east local imperial aside differences unite soviet union45 americans took view fear soviet union helped historic francogerman enmity could anticommunism recent arabisraeli dispute source constant puzzlement american officials 1950s arab states israelis seemed interest fighting rather uniting soviet unioncitation needed visit middle east 1953 drum support medo secretary state john foster dulles found much astonishment arab states fearful zionism communists46
policy united states colored considerable uncertainty befriend near east american policy torn desire maintain good relations nato allies britain france also major colonial powers desire align third world nationalists free world camp47 though would entirely false describe coup deposing king farouk july 1952 central intelligence agency coup nasser society free officers nonetheless close contact operatives miles copeland beforehand nasser maintained links potential allies egyptian communist party left muslim brotherhood right48

returned washington dulles advised eisenhower arab states believed united states back state israel aggressive expansion basic political problem improve moslem states attitudes towards western democracies prestige area constant decline ever since war46 immediate consequence policy evenhandedness united states publicly sided arab states several disputes israel 1953–5456 moreover dulles share sentimental regard angloamerican special relationship americans lean towards egyptian side angloegyptian disputes57 extremely difficult negotiations british evacuation suez canal base 1954–55 americans generally supported egypt though time trying hard limit extent damage might cause angloamerican relations58

nasser arms purchase
nasser wanted united states supply arms generous scale egypt67 nasser refused promise arms might would used israel rejected hand american demand military advisory group sent egypt part price arms sales68
nassers first choice buying weapons united states frequent antiisraeli speeches sponsorship fedayeen making raids israel made difficult eisenhower administration approval congress sell weapons egypt american public opinion deeply hostile towards selling arms egypt might used israel moreover eisenhower feared starting middle eastern arms race68 eisenhower much valued tripartite declaration keeping peace near east 1950 order limit extent arabs israelis could engage arms race three nations dominated arms trade noncommunist world namely united states united kingdom france signed tripartite declaration committed limiting much arms could sell near east also ensuring arms sales side matched arms sales equal quantity quality other69 eisenhower viewed tripartite declaration sharply restricted many arms egypt could west elements keeping peace israel arabs believed setting arms race would inevitably lead
egyptians made continuous attempts purchase heavy arms czechoslovakia years 1955 deal70

nasser played widespread suspicion western defence pact merely veiled colonialism arab disunity weakness—especially struggle israel—was consequence british machinations39 also began align egypt kingdom saudi arabia—whose rulers hereditary enemies hashemites—in effort frustrate british efforts draw syria jordan lebanon orbit baghdad pact nasser struck blow britain negotiating arms deal communist czechoslovakia september 195588 thereby ending egypts reliance western arms later members warsaw pact also sold arms egypt syria practice sales eastern bloc authorised soviet union attempt increase soviet influence middle east caused tensions united states warsaw pact nations strong presence region

nasser britain
british prime minister anthony eden especially upset sacking glubb pasha british politician recalled

eden last straw reverse insisted nassers nasser enemy middle east would rest destroyed friends eliminated last vestiges influence nasser must therefore destroyed91

sacking glubb pasha grievous blow british influence eden became consumed obsessional hatred nasser march 1956 onwards private committed overthrow nasser92 american historian donald neff wrote edens often hysterical overwrought views towards nasser almost certainly reflected influence amphetamines eden become addicted following botched operation 1953 together related effects sustained sleep deprivation eden slept average hours night early 195693
increasingly nasser came viewed british circles—and particular eden—as dictator akin benito mussolini ironicallyeditorializing buildup crisis labour leader hugh gaitskell leftleaning tabloid newspaper mirror first made comparison nasser mussolini angloegyptian relations would continue downward spiral
britain eager tame nasser looked towards united states support however eisenhower strongly opposed britishfrench military action94 americas closest arab ally saudi arabia fundamentally opposed hashemitedominated baghdad pact egypt keen increase influence region95 failure baghdad pact aided goal reducing britains dominance region great britain would preferred overthrow nasser america however uncomfortable czech arms deal thought wiser propitiate him96
aswan high
1956 nasser officially recognised peoples republic china angered secretary dulles sponsor republic china89 move coupled impression project beyond egypts economic capabilities caused eisenhower withdraw american financial aswan project july89
eisenhower administration believed nasser able secure soviet economic support high would beyond capacity soviet union support turn would strain sovietegyptian relations97 eisenhower wrote march 1956 egypt finds thus isolated rest arab world ally sight except soviet russia would quickly sick prospect would join search decent peace region97 dulles told brother director allen dulles soviets make offer make propaganda within satellite bloc dont bread squeezed build dam97

hasan afif elhasan says 1955–1956 american proposed nasser solve arab–israeli conflict peacefully exchange finance high nile river nasser rejected offer would mean siding west opposed remaining neutral cold since alternative peace agreement unpredictable consequences nassers refusal accept proposal irrational according elhasan107
