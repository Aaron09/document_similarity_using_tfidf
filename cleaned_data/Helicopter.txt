main limitation helicopter speed73 several reasons helicopter cannot fast fixedwing aircraft helicopter hovering outer tips rotor travel speed determined length blade rotational speed moving helicopter however speed blades relative depends speed helicopter well rotational speed airspeed advancing rotor blade much higher helicopter possible blade exceed speed sound thus produce vastly increased drag vibration
time advancing blade creates lift traveling forward retreating blade produces less lift aircraft accelerate speed blade tips spinning retreating blade passes moving speed blade produces lift resulting high torque stresses central shaft retreatingblade side vehicle cause loss control dual counterrotating blades prevent situation advancing retreating blades balanced forces
advancing blade higher airspeed retreating blade generates dissymmetry lift rotor blades designed flap lift twist advancing blade flaps develops smaller angle attack conversely retreating blade flaps develops higher angle attack generates lift high speeds force rotors flap excessively retreating blade reach high angle stall reason maximum safe forward airspeed helicopter given design rating called velocity never exceed74 addition possible helicopter airspeed excessive amount retreating blade stalls results high vibration pitchup roll retreating blade
noise
closing years 20th century designers began working helicopter noise reduction urban communities often expressed great dislike noisy aircraft police passenger helicopters unpopular redesigns followed closure city heliports government action constrain flight paths national parks places natural beauty
