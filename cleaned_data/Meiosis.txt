overviewedit
although process meiosis related general cell division process mitosis differs important respects


recombination
meiosis
shuffles genes chromosomes pair received parent producing recombinant chromosomes unique genetic combinations every gamete


mitosis
occurs needed repair damage
usually occurs identical sister chromatids result genetic changes






chromosome number ploidy
meiosis
produces four genetically unique cells half number chromosomes parent


mitosis
produces genetically identical cells number chromosomes parent





meiosis begins diploid cell contains copies chromosome termed homologs first cell undergoes replication homolog consists identical sister chromatids homologs pair exchange homologous recombination leading physical connections crossovers homologs first meiotic division homologs segregated separate daughter cells spindle apparatus cells proceed second division without intervening round replication sister chromatids segregated separate daughter cells produce total four haploid cells female animals employ slight variation pattern produce large ovum small polar bodies recombination individual chromatid consist combination maternal paternal resulting offspring genetically distinct either parent furthermore individual gamete include assortment maternal paternal recombinant chromatids genetic diversity resulting sexual reproduction contributes variation traits upon natural selection
meiosis uses many mechanisms mitosis type cell division used eukaryotes divide cell identical daughter cells plants fungi protists meiosis results formation spores haploid cells divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization eukaryotes like bdelloid rotifers ability carry meiosis acquired ability reproduce parthenogenesis
meiosis occur archaea bacteria generally reproduce asexual processes binary fission however sexual process known horizontal gene transfer involves transfer bacterium archaeon another recombination molecules different parental origin

gametic life cycle






zygotic life cycle


main article biological life cycle
meiosis occurs eukaryotic life cycles involving sexual reproduction consisting constant cyclical process meiosis fertilization takes place alongside normal mitotic cell division multicellular organisms intermediary step diploid haploid transition organism grows certain stages life cycle germ cells produce gametes somatic cells make body organism involved gamete production
cycling meiosis fertilization events produces series transitions back forth alternating haploid diploid states organism phase life cycle occur either diploid state gametic diploid life cycle haploid state zygotic haploid life cycle sporic haplodiploid life cycle distinct organism phases haploid state diploid state sense three types life cycles utilize sexual reproduction differentiated location organism phasescitation needed
gametic life cycle diplontic life cycle humans part organism diploid grown diploid cell called zygote organisms diploid germline stem cells undergo meiosis create haploid gametes spermatozoa males females fertilize form zygote diploid zygote undergoes repeated cellular division mitosis grow organism
zygotic life cycle organism haploid instead spawned proliferation differentiation single haploid cell called gamete organisms opposing contribute haploid gametes form diploid zygote zygote undergoes meiosis immediately creating four haploid cells cells undergo mitosis create organism many fungi many protozoa utilize zygotic life cyclecitation needed
finally sporic life cycle living organism alternates haploid diploid states consequently cycle also known alternation generations diploid organisms germline cells undergo meiosis produce spores spores proliferate mitosis growing haploid organism haploid organisms gamete combines another haploid organisms gamete creating zygote zygote undergoes repeated mitosis differentiation become diploid organism sporic life cycle considered fusion gametic zygotic life cyclescitation needed
processedit
preparatory steps lead meiosis identical pattern name interphase mitotic cell cyclecitation needed
interphase divided three phases

growth phase active phase cell synthesizes vast array proteins including enzymes structural proteins need growth chromosomes consists single linear molecule
synthesis phase genetic material replicated cells chromosomes duplicates become identical sister chromatids attached centromere replication change ploidy cell since centromere number remains identical sister chromatids condensed densely packaged chromosomes visible light microscope take place prophase meiosis
growth phase phase seen mitosis present meiosis meiotic prophase corresponds closely phase mitotic cell cycle

interphase followed meiosis meiosis meiosis separates homologous chromosomes still made sister chromatids daughter cells thus reducing chromosome number half meiosis sister chromatids decouple resultant daughter chromosomes segregated four daughter cells diploid organisms daughter cells resulting meiosis haploid contain copy chromosome species cells enter resting phase known interkinesis meiosis meiosis
meiosis divided prophase metaphase anaphase telophase stages similar purpose analogous subphases mitotic cell cycle therefore meiosis includes stages meiosis prophase metaphase anaphase telophase meiosis prophase metaphase anaphase telophase
meiosis generates gamete genetic diversity ways independent assortment independent orientation homologous chromosome pairs along metaphase plate metaphase orientation sister chromatids metaphase subsequent separation homologs sister chromatids anaphase allows random independent distribution chromosomes daughter cell ultimately gametes8 crossing physical exchange homologous chromosomal regions homologous recombination prophase results combinations within chromosomes9
meiosis specific genes highly transcribed10 addition strong meiotic stagespecific expression mrna also pervasive translational controls selective usage preformed mrna regulating ultimate meiotic stagespecific protein expression genes meiosis11 thus transcriptional translational controls determine broad restructuring meiotic cells needed carry meiosis

prophase iedit
prophase typically longest phase meiosis prophase homologous chromosomes pair exchange homologous recombination often results chromosomal crossover process critical pairing homologous chromosomes hence accurate segregation chromosomes first meiosis division combinations created crossover significant source genetic variation result combinations alleles beneficial paired replicated chromosomes called bivalents tetrads chromosomes four chromatids chromosome coming parent process pairing homologous chromosomes called synapsis stage nonsister chromatids crossover points called chiasmata plural singular chiasma13 prophase historically divided series substages named according appearance chromosomes
leptoteneedit
first stage prophase leptotene stage also known leptonema greek words meaning thin threads1427in stage prophase individual chromosomes—each consisting sister chromatids—become individualized form visible strands within nucleus142715353 sister chromatids closely associate visually indistinguishable another leptotene lateral elements synaptonemal complex assemble leptotene short duration progressive condensation coiling chromosome fibers takes place

zygotene stage also known zygonema greek words meaning paired threads1427 occurs chromosomes approximately line homologous chromosome pairs organisms called bouquet stage telomeres cluster nucleus stage synapsis pairingcoming together homologous chromosomes takes place facilitated assembly central element synaptonemal complex pairing brought zipperlike fashion start centromere procentric chromosome ends proterminal portion intermediate individuals pair equal length position centromere thus pairing highly specific exact paired chromosomes called bivalent tetrad chromosomes
pachyteneedit
pachytene pronounced ˈpækɪtiːn pakəteen stage also known pachynema greek words meaning thick threads1427 point tetrad chromosomes formed known bivalent stage homologous recombination including chromosomal crossover crossing occurs nonsister chromatids homologous chromosomes exchange segments regions homology chromosomes however wholly identical exchange information small region homology sites exchange happens chiasmata form exchange information nonsister chromatids results recombination information chromosome complete information gaps formed result process chromosomes cannot distinguished synaptonemal complex actual crossing perceivable microscope chiasmata visible next stage
