austrian view inflation money supply unsustainable boom asset prices stocks bonds capital goods time belatedly tightened 1928 late austrian view significant economic contraction inevitable45 february 1929 hayek published paper predicting federal reserves actions would lead crisis starting stock credit markets46
according rothbard government support failed enterprises keeping wages market values actually prolonged depression47 hayek unlike rothbard believed since 1970s along monetarists federal reserve contributed problems depression permitting money supply shrink earliest years depression48 however 1932 1934 hayek criticised bank england taking contractionary stance49
hans sennholz argued boom busts plagued american economy 1819–20 1839–43 1857–60 1873–78 1893–97 1920–21 generated government creating boom easy money credit soon followed inevitable bust spectacular crash 1929 followed five years reckless credit expansion federal reserve system coolidge administration passing sixteenth amendment passage federal reserve rising government deficits passage hawleysmoot tariff revenue 1932 exacerbated crisis prolonging it50
ludwig mises wrote 1930s credit expansion cannot increase supply real goods merely brings rearrangement diverts capital investment away course prescribed state economic wealth market conditions causes production pursue paths would follow unless economy acquire increase material goods result upswing lacks solid base real prosperity illusory prosperity develop increase economic wealth accumulation savings made available productive investment rather arose credit expansion created illusion increase sooner later must become apparent economic situation built sand5152

breakdown international trade
many economists argued sharp decline international trade 1930 helped worsen depression especially countries significantly dependent foreign trade 1995 survey american economic historians twothirds agreed smoot–hawley tariff least worsened great depression65 historians economists partly blame american smoot–hawley tariff enacted june 1930 worsening depression seriously reducing international trade causing retaliatory tariffs countries foreign trade small part overall economic activity concentrated businesses like farming much larger factor many countries66 average valorem rate duties dutiable imports 1921–25 tariff jumped 1931–35 dollar terms american exports declined next four years billion 1929 billion 1933 physical volume exports fall also prices fell written hardest farm commodities wheat cotton tobacco lumber
governments around world took various steps spending less money foreign goods imposing tariffs import quotas exchange controls restrictions formed tension trade nations causing major deduction depression countries enforced measures protectionism countries raised tariffs drastically enforced severe restrictions foreign exchange transactions countries condensed trade exchange restrictions marginally67

countries remained gold standard keeping currencies fixed likely restrict foreign trade countries resorted protectionist policies strengthen balance payments limit gold losses hoped restrictions depletions would hold economic decline67
countries abandoned gold standard allowed currencies depreciate caused balance payments strengthen also freed monetary policy central banks could lower interest rates lenders last resort possessed best policy instruments fight depression need protectionism67
