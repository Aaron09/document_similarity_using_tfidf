formal systems completeness consistency effective axiomatizationedit
incompleteness theorems apply formal systems sufficient complexity express basic arithmetic natural numbers consistent effectively axiomatized concepts detailed particularly context firstorder logic formal systems also called formal theories general formal system deductive apparatus consists particular axioms along rules symbolic manipulation rules inference allow derivation theorems axioms example system firstorder peano arithmetic system variables intended denote natural numbers systems theory sentences formal system express statements natural numbers incompleteness theorems formal provability within systems rather provability informal sense
several properties formal system including completeness consistency existence effective axiomatization incompleteness theorems show systems contain sufficient amount arithmetic cannot possess three properties
effective axiomatizationedit
formal system said effectively axiomatized also called effectively generated theorems recursively enumerable franzén 2004
means computer program principle could enumerate theorems system without listing statements theorems examples effectively generated theories include peano arithmetic zermelo–fraenkel theory
theory known true arithmetic consists true statements standard integers language peano arithmetic theory consistent complete contains sufficient amount arithmetic however recursively enumerable axioms thus satisfy hypotheses incompleteness theorems
completenessedit
axioms syntactically negation complete statement axioms language statement negation provable axioms smith 2007 notion relevant gödels first incompleteness theorem confused semantic completeness means axioms proves semantic tautologies given language completeness theorem gödel proved first order logic semantically complete syntactically complete since sentences expressible language first order logic neither proved disproved axioms logic alone example flower pretty
mere system logic would absurd expect syntactic completeness system mathematics thinkers hilbert believed matter time find axiomatization would allow either prove disprove proving negation every mathematical formula
formal system might syntactically incomplete design logics generally incomplete simply necessary axioms discovered included example euclidean geometry without parallel postulate incomplete possible prove disprove parallel postulate remaining axioms similarly theory dense linear orders complete becomes complete extra axiom stating endpoints order continuum hypothesis statement language provable within complete case obvious candidate axiom resolves issue
theory firstorder peano arithmetic consistent infinite recursively enumerable axioms encode enough arithmetic hypotheses incompleteness theorem thus first incompleteness theorem peano arithmetic complete theorem gives explicit example statement arithmetic neither provable disprovable peanos arithmetics moreover statement true usual model moreover effectively axiomatized consistent extension peano arithmetic complete
consistencyedit
axioms simply consistent statement statement negation provable axioms inconsistent otherwise
peano arithmetic provably consistent within similarly provably consistent within exists inaccessible cardinal proves consistent least cardinal sitting inside neumann universe model theory consistent model
takes statements language peano arithmetic axioms theory complete recursively enumerable axioms describe addition multiplication however consistent
additional examples inconsistent theories arise paradoxes result axiom schema unrestricted comprehension assumed theory
systems contain arithmeticedit
incompleteness theorems apply formal systems able prove sufficient collection facts natural numbers sufficient collection theorems robinson arithmetic systems peano arithmetic directly express statements natural numbers others theory able interpret statements natural numbers language either options appropriate incompleteness theorems
theory algebraically closed fields given characteristic complete consistent infinite recursively enumerable axioms however possible encode integers theory theory cannot describe arithmetic integers similar example theory real closed fields essentially equivalent tarskis axioms euclidean geometry euclidean geometry tarskis formulation example complete consistent effectively axiomatized theory
system presburger arithmetic consists axioms natural numbers addition operation multiplication omitted presburger arithmetic complete consistent recursively enumerable encode addition multiplication natural numbers showing gödels theorems needs theory encode addition also multiplication
willard 2001 studied weak families arithmetic systems allow enough arithmetic relations formalise gödel numbering strong enough multiplication function fail prove second incompleteness theorem systems consistent capable proving consistency selfverifying theories
conflicting goalsedit
choosing axioms goal able prove many correct results possible without proving incorrect results example could imagine true axioms allow prove every true arithmetical claim natural numbers smith 2007 standard system firstorder logic inconsistent axioms prove every statement language sometimes called principle explosion thus automatically complete axioms complete consistent however proves maximal noncontradictory theorems hinman 2005
pattern illustrated previous sections peano arithmetic exists inaccessible cardinal cannot generally broken exists inaccessible cardinal cannot proved consistent also complete illustrated exists inaccessible cardinal theory unresolved continuum hypothesis
first incompleteness theorem shows formal systems express basic arithmetic complete consistent finite list axioms never created time additional consistent statement added axiom true statements still cannot proved even axiom axiom ever added makes system complete cost making system inconsistent even possible infinite list axioms complete consistent effectively axiomatized
first incompleteness theoremedit
gödels first incompleteness theorem first appeared theorem gödels 1931 paper formally undecidable propositions principia mathematica related systems hypotheses theorem improved shortly thereafter barkley rosser 1936 using rossers trick
resulting theorem incorporating rossers improvement paraphrased english follows formal system includes assumption system effectively generated

first incompleteness theorem consistent formal system within certain amount elementary arithmetic carried incomplete statements language neither proved disproved raatikainen 2015

unprovable statement referred theorem often referred gödel sentence system proof constructs particular gödel sentence system infinitely many statements language system share properties conjunction gödel sentence logically valid sentence
effectively generated system gödel sentence possible define larger system contains whole plus additional axiom result complete system gödels theorem also apply thus also cannot complete case indeed theorem axiom states provable contradiction presented provability within however incompleteness theorem applies gödel statement showing also incomplete differ refer rather
syntactic form gödel sentenceedit
gödel sentence designed refer indirectly sentence states particular sequence steps used construct another sentence constructed sentence provable however sequence steps constructed sentence turns gödel sentence indirectly states unprovability within smith 2007
prove first incompleteness theorem gödel demonstrated notion provability within system could expressed purely terms arithmetical functions operate gödel numbers sentences system therefore system prove certain facts numbers also indirectly prove facts statements provided effectively generated questions provability statements within system represented questions arithmetical properties numbers would decidable system complete
thus although gödel sentence refers indirectly sentences system read arithmetical statement gödel sentence directly refers natural numbers asserts natural number particular property property given primitive recursive relation smith 2007 gödel sentence written language arithmetic simple syntactic form particular expressed formula language arithmetic consisting number leading universal quantifiers followed quantifierfree body formulas level

proof contradiction three essential parts begin choose formal system meets proposed criteria

statements system represented natural numbers known gödel numbers significance properties statements—such truth falsehood—will equivalent determining whether gödel numbers certain properties properties statements therefore demonstrated examining gödel numbers part culminates construction formula expressing idea statement provable system applied statement system
formal system possible construct number whose matching statement interpreted selfreferential essentially says statement unprovable done using technique called diagonalization socalled origins cantors diagonal argument
within formal system statement permits demonstration neither provable disprovable system therefore system cannot fact ωconsistent hence original assumption proposed system criteria false

arithmetization syntaxedit
main problem fleshing proof described seems first construct statement equivalent cannot proved would somehow contain reference could easily give rise infinite regress gödels ingenious technique show statements matched numbers often called arithmetization syntax proving statement replaced testing whether number given property allows selfreferential formula constructed avoids infinite regress definitions technique later used alan turing work entscheidungsproblem
simple terms method devised every formula statement formulated system gets unique number called gödel number possible mechanically convert back forth formulas gödel numbers numbers involved might long indeed terms number digits barrier matters numbers constructed simple example english stored sequence numbers computers using ascii unicode



word hello represented 7269767679 using decimal ascii number 7269767679
logical statement represented 120061121032061062032121061120 using octal ascii number 120061121032061062032121061120



principle proving statement true false shown equivalent proving number matching statement doesnt given property formal system strong enough support reasoning numbers general support reasoning numbers represent formulae statements well crucially system support reasoning properties numbers results equivalent reasoning provability equivalent statements
construction statement provabilityedit
shown principle system indirectly make statements provability analyzing properties numbers representing statements possible show create statement actually
formula contains exactly free variable called statement form classsign soon replaced specific number statement form turns bona fide statement either provable system certain formulas show every natural number true proved precise requirement original proof weaker proof sketch suffice particular true every specific arithmetic operation finite number natural numbers 2×36
statement forms statements therefore cannot proved disproved every statement form assigned gödel number denoted choice free variable used form relevant assignment gödel number
notion provability also encoded gödel numbers following since proof list statements obey certain rules gödel number proof defined every statement whether number gödel number proof relation gödel number potential gödel number proof arithmetical relation numbers therefore statement form bewy uses arithmetical relation state gödel number proof exists

bewy gödel number formula gödel number proof formula encoded

name short beweisbar german word provable name originally used gödel denote provability formula described note bewy merely abbreviation represents particular long formula original language string claimed part language
important feature formula bewy statement provable system bewgp also provable proof would corresponding gödel number existence causes bewgp satisfied
diagonalizationedit
next step proof obtain statement indirectly asserts unprovability although gödel constructed statement directly existence least statement follows diagonal lemma says sufficiently strong formal system statement form statement system proves



letting negation bewx obtain theorem

bewgp

defined roughly states gödel number gödel number unprovable formula
statement literally equal bewgp rather states certain calculation performed resulting gödel number unprovable statement calculation performed resulting gödel number turns gödel number similar following sentence english

preceded quotes unprovable preceded quotes unprovable

sentence directly refer stated transformation made original sentence obtained result thus sentence indirectly asserts unprovability proof diagonal lemma employs similar method
assume axiomatic system ωconsistent statement obtained previous section
provable bewgp would provable argued asserts negation bewgp thus system would inconsistent proving statement negation contradiction shows cannot provable
negation provable bewgp would provable constructed equivalent negation bewgp however specific number cannot gödel number proof provable previous paragraph thus hand system proves number certain property gödel number proof hand every specific number prove property impossible ωconsistent system thus negation provable
thus statement undecidable axiomatic system neither proved disproved within system
fact show provable requires assumption system consistent stronger assumption ωconsistency required show negation provable thus constructed particular system

system ωconsistent prove neither negation undecidable
system consistent situation prove negation later case statement false provable system ωconsistent

tries missing axioms avoid incompleteness system either axioms definition gödel number proof statement changes means formula bewx different thus apply diagonal lemma obtain statement different previous undecidable system ωconsistent
proof berrys paradoxedit
george boolos 1989 sketches alternative proof first incompleteness theorem uses berrys paradox rather liar paradox construct true unprovable formula similar proof method independently discovered saul kripke boolos 1998 booloss proof proceeds constructing computably enumerable true sentences arithmetic another sentence true contained gives first incompleteness theorem corollary according boolos proof interesting provides different sort reason incompleteness effective consistent theories arithmetic boolos 1998
