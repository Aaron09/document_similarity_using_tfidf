since adoption international system units 1971 numerous criticisms concept mole unit like metre second arisen

number molecules given amount material fixed dimensionless quantity expressed simply number requiring distinct base unit7
thermodynamic mole irrelevant analytical chemistry could cause avoidable costs advanced economies13
mole true metric measuring unit rather parametric unit amount substance parametric base quantity14
