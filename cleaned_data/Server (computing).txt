historyedit
word server computing comes queueing theory3 dates 20th century notably used kendall 1953 along service paper introduced kendalls notation earlier papers erlang 1909 concrete terms telephone operators used
computing server dates least 19694 earliest documents describing arpanet predecessor internet contrasted user distinguishing types host serverhost userhost serving also dates early documents contrasting servinghost usinghost
jargon file defines server common sense process performing service requests usually remote 1981 version reading

server kind daemon performs service requester often runs computer server runs

operationedit




network based client–server model multiple individual clients request services resources centralized servers


strictly speaking term server refers computer program process running program metonymy refers device used device dedicated running several server programs network device called host addition server words serve service noun verb frequently used though servicer servant nota word service noun refer either abstract form functionality service alternatively refer computer program turns computer server windows service originally used servers serve users users servers sense obey today often says servers serve data sense give instance servers serve pages users service requests
server part client–server model model server serves data clients nature communication client server request response contrast peertopeer model relationship ondemand reciprocation principle computerized process used called another process particularly remotely particularly share resource server calling process processes client thus general purpose computer connected network host servers example files device shared process process file server similarly server software capable computer laptop personal computer host server
request–response common client–server design others publish–subscribe pattern publish–subscribe pattern clients register pub–sub server subscribing specified types messages initial registration done request–response thereafter pub–sub server forwards matching messages clients without requests server pushes messages client rather client pulling messages server request–response6
referring hardware word server typically designates computer models specialized role general server performs role better generic personal computer
