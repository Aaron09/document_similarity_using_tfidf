recently refreshed sourdough bubbling fermentation recipe calls sourdough left last time recipe made


recursion process procedure goes steps procedure involves invoking procedure procedure goes recursion said recursive
understand recursion must recognize distinction procedure running procedure procedure steps based rules running procedure involves actually following rules performing steps analogy procedure like written recipe running procedure like actually preparing meal
recursion related reference within specification procedure execution procedure instance recipe might refer cooking vegetables another procedure turn requires heating water forth however recursive procedure least steps calls instance procedure like sourdough recipe calling dough left last time recipe made course immediately creates possibility endless loop recursion properly used definition step question skipped certain cases procedure complete like sourdough recipe also tells starter dough case youve never made even properly defined recursive procedure easy humans perform requires distinguishing partially executed invocation procedure requires administration various simultaneous instances procedures progressed reason recursive definitions rare everyday situations example could following procedure find maze proceed forward reaching either exit branching point dead considered branching point branches point reached exit terminate otherwise branch turn using procedure recursively every trial fails reaching dead ends return path branching point report failure whether actually defines terminating procedure depends nature maze must allow loops case executing procedure requires carefully recording currently explored branching points branches already exhaustively tried
language
linguist noam chomsky among many others argued lack upper bound number grammatical sentences language lack upper bound grammatical sentence length beyond practical constraints time available utter explained consequence recursion natural language12 understood terms recursive definition syntactic category sentence sentence structure follows verb another sentence dorothy thinks witches dangerous sentence witches dangerous occurs larger sentence defined recursively roughly something structure includes noun phrase verb optionally another sentence really special case mathematical definition recursion
provides understanding creativity language—the unbounded number grammatical sentences—because immediately predicts sentences arbitrary length dorothy thinks toto suspects said course many structures apart sentences defined recursively therefore many ways sentence embed instances category inside another years languages general proved amenable kind analysis
recently however generally accepted idea recursion essential property human language challenged daniel everett basis claims pirahã language andrew nevins david pesetsky cilene rodrigues among many argued this3 literary selfreference case argued different kind mathematical logical recursion4
recursion plays crucial role syntax also natural language semantics word example construed function apply sentence meanings create sentences likewise noun phrase meanings verb phrase meanings others also apply intransitive verbs transitive verbs ditransitive verbs order provide single denotation suitably flexible typically defined take different types meanings arguments done defining simple case combines sentences defining cases recursively terms simple one5
