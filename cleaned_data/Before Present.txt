radiocarbon datingedit
radiocarbon dating first used 1940 beginning 1954 metrologists established 1950 origin year scale radiocarbon dating using 1950based reference sample oxalic acid according scientist currie lloyd

dates determined using radiocarbon dating come kinds uncalibrated also called libby calibrated also called cambridge dates13 uncalibrated radiocarbon dates clearly noted uncalibrated years identical calendar dates fact level atmospheric radiocarbon carbon14 strictly constant span time radiocarbondated uncalibrated radiocarbon ages converted calendar dates means calibration curves based comparison radiocarbon dates samples independently dated methods dendrochronology dating basis tree growthrings stratigraphy dating basis sediment layers sedimentary rock calibrated dates expressed indicates calibrated years calendar years 1950
