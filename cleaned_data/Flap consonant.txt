contrast stops trillsedit
main difference flap stop flap buildup pressure behind place articulation consequently release burst otherwise flap similar brief stop
flaps also contrast trills airstream causes articulator vibrate trills realized single contact like flap variable whereas flap limited single contact trill brief made single contact sometimes erroneously described allophonic flap true flap active articulation whereas trill passive articulation flap tongue makes active gesture contact target place articulation whereas trill contact vibration caused airstream rather active movement
flapedit
many linguists terms flap indiscriminately peter ladefoged proposed might useful distinguish however usage inconsistent contradicting even different editions text1 proposed version distinction strikes point contact directly brief stop whereas flap strikes point contact tangentially flaps typically made retracting tongue behind alveolar ridge moving forward strikes ridge passing later however used term flap cases2 subsequent work labiodental flap clarified issue flaps involve retraction active articulator forwardstriking movement3 linguists make distinction alveolar transcribed fishhook flap transcribed small capital recognized ipa4 terms retroflex flap symbol captures initial retraction subsequent forward movement tongue involved otherwise alveolars typically called taps articulations flaps language confirmed contrast flap place articulation however distinction claimed norwegian alveolar apical postalveolarretroflex apical flap differ place speakers5

retroflex flap also common norwegian dialects swedish dialects
lateral flapsedit
many languages africa asia pacific dont distinguish lateral flap however also possible many languages lateral–central contrast even consistently neutral articulation perceived sometimes lateral sometimes central suggested case japanese example8

derived symbols becoming frequent fontediting software widely accessible note besides sanctioned unicode value however retroflex lateral flap written unicodecompliant fashion digraph alveolar lateral flap righttail diacritic
palatal velar lateral flaps represented short diacritic letter homorganic approximant although diacritic would need appear palatal ascender
noncoronal flapsedit
common noncoronal flap labiodental flap found throughout central africa languages margi 2005 adopted righthook



sound supported fonts previously transcribed breve diacritic symbols
flaps much less common include epiglottal flap bilabial flap banda allophone labiodental flap velar lateral flap allophone kanite melpa often transcribed breve diacritic note like velar trill central velar flap possible tongue soft palate cannot move together easily enough produce sound
flaps found breve diacritic could used represent would properly combined symbol corresponding voiced stop palatal uvular flap unlike velar flap believed articulatorily possible could represented ɢ̆ʀ̆9
