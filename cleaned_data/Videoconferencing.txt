artists conception 21st century videotelephony imagined early 20th century 1910






video telephone booth 1930


concept videotelephony first popularized late 1870s united states europe although basic sciences permit earliest trials would take nearly half century discovered first embodied device came known video telephone videophone evolved intensive research experimentation several telecommunication fields notably electrical telegraphy telephony radio television
simple analog videophone communication could established early invention television antecedent usually consisted closedcircuit television systems connected coax cable radio example german reich postzentralamt post office video telephone network serving berlin several german cities coaxial cables 1936 194067
development crucial video technology first started latter half 1920s united kingdom united states spurred notably john logie baird atts bell labs occurred part least serve adjunct supplementing telephone number organizations believed videotelephony would superior plain voice communications however video technology deployed analog television broadcasting long could become practical—or popular—for videophones




multiple user videoconferencing first demonstrated stanford research institutes computer technology 1968


first manned space flights nasa used radiofrequency video links direction channels routinely type videotelephony reporting distant locations news media become regular users mobile links satellites using specially equipped trucks much later special satellite videophones briefcase
technique expensive though could used applications telemedicine distance education business meetings attempts using normal telephony networks transmit slowscan video first systems developed corporation first researched 1950s failed mostly poor picture quality lack efficient video compression techniques greater bandwidth mbits rate picturephone 1970s also achieve commercial success mostly high cost also lack network effect hundred picturephones world users extremely contacts could actually call interoperability videophone systems would exist decades
videotelephony developed parallel conventional voice telephone systems midtolate 20th century expensive videoconferencing systems rapidly evolved throughout 1980s 1990s proprietary equipment software network requirements standardsbased technologies available anyone purchase reasonable cost
late 20th century advent powerful video codecs combined highspeed internet broadband isdn service videotelephony become practical technology regular
1980s digital telephony transmission networks became possible isdn networks assuring minimum rate usually kilobitss compressed video audio transmission time also research forms digital video audio communication many technologies media space widely used today videoconferencing still important area research89 first dedicated systems started appear isdn networks expanding throughout world first commercial videoconferencing systems sold companies came picturetel corp initial public offering november 1984

videoconferencing systems throughout 1990s rapidly evolved expensive proprietary equipment software network requirements standardsbased technology readily available general public reasonable cost
finally 1990s internet protocolbased videoconferencing became possible efficient video compression technologies developed permitting desktop personal computer pcbased videoconferencing 1992 cuseeme developed cornell dorcey 1995 first public videoconference north america africa took place linking technofair francisco technorave cyberdeli cape town winter olympics opening ceremony nagano japan seiji ozawa conducted beethovens ninth symphony simultaneously across five continents nearreal time
videoconferencing technology initially used primarily within internal corporate communication networks first community service usages technology started 1992 unique partnership picturetel corporations time promoting jointly developed desktop based videoconferencing product known pcs1 next years project diane diversified information assistance network grew utilize variety videoconferencing platforms create multistate cooperative public service distance education network consisting several hundred schools libraries science museums zoos parks many community oriented organizations
2000s videotelephony popularized free internet services skype ichat plugins online telecommunication programs promoted cost albeit lowerquality videoconferencing virtually every location internet connection

adoptionedit
century futurists envisioned future telephone conversations take place actual facetoface encounters video well audio sometimes simply possible practical facetoface meetings people sometimes telephone conversation conference call adequate times email exchanges adequate however videoconferencing adds another possible alternative considered

live conversation needed
nonverbal visual information important component conversation
parties conversation cant physically come location
expense time travel consideration

observers argue three outstanding issues prevented videoconferencing becoming widely adopted form communication despite ubiquity videoconferencingcapable systems18

contact contact plays large role conversational turntaking perceived attention intent aspects group communication19 traditional telephone conversations give contact cues many videoconferencing systems arguably worse provide incorrect impression remote interlocutor avoiding contact telepresence systems cameras located screens reduce amount parallax observed users issue also addressed research generates synthetic image contact using stereo reconstruction20
telcordia technologies formerly bell communications research owns patent eyetoeye videoconferencing using rear projection screens video camera behind evolved 1960s military system provided videoconferencing services white house various government military facilities technique eliminates need special cameras image processing21
appearance consciousness second psychological problem videoconferencing camera video stream possibly even recorded burden presenting acceptable onscreen appearance present audioonly communication early studies alphonse chapanis found addition video actually impaired communication possibly consciousness camera22
signal latency information transport digital signals many steps need time telecommunicated conversation increased latency time larger 150–300 becomes noticeable soon observed unnatural distracting therefore next stable large bandwidth small total roundtrip time another major technical requirement communication channel interactive videoconferencing23
bandwidth quality service countries difficult expensive high quality connection fast enough goodquality video conferencing technologies adsl limited upload speeds cannot upload download simultaneously full speed internet speeds increase higher quality high definition video conferencing become readily available
complexity systems users technical want simple interface hardware systems unplugged cord flat battery remote control seen failure contributing perceived unreliability drives users back traditional meetings successful systems backed support teams proactively support provide fast assistance required
perceived lack interoperability systems readily interconnect example isdn systems require gateway popular software solutions cannot easily connect hardware systems systems different standards features qualities require additional configuration connecting dissimilar systems free software systems circumvent limitation making relatively easy single user communicate multiple incompatible platforms
expense commercial systems welldesigned telepresence systems require specially designed rooms cost hundreds thousands dollars rooms codecs integration equipment multipoint control units high fidelity sound systems furniture monthly charges also required bridging services high capacity broadband service

reasons many systems often used internal corporate less likely result lost sales alternative companies lacking dedicated facilities rental videoconferencingequipped meeting rooms cities around world clients book rooms turn meeting technical aspects prearranged support readily available needed issue eyecontact solved advancing technology including smartphones screen camera essentially place ubiquity smartphones tablet computers computers builtin audio webcams developed countries obviates need expensive hardware
