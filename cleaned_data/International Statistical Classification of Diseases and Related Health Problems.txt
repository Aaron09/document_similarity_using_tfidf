international conference ninth revision international statistical classification diseases injuries causes death convened geneva september october 1975 discussions leading conference originally intended little change updating classification mainly expense adapting data processing systems time classification revised
enormous growth interest ways found responding partly modifying classification partly introducing special coding provisions number representations made specialist bodies become interested using statistics subject areas classification regarded inappropriately arranged considerable pressure detail adaptation classification make relevant evaluation medical care classifying conditions chapters concerned part body affected rather dealing underlying generalized disease5
scale representations countries areas detailed sophisticated classification irrelevant nevertheless needed classification based order assess progress health care control disease field test biaxial classification approach—one axis criterion anatomy another etiology—showed impracticability approach routine usecitation needed
final proposals presented accepted conference 197810 retained basic structure although much additional detail level four digit subcategories optional five digit subdivisions benefit users requiring detail care taken ensure categories three digit level appropriate
