physicists time maxwell strong interest psychology particularly interested following steps isaac newton thomas young study colour vision 1855 1872 published intervals series investigations concerning perception colour colourblindness colour theory awarded rumford medal theory colour vision101
isaac newton demonstrated using prisms white lights sunlight composed number monochromatic components could recombined white light102 newton also showed orange paint made yellow could look exactly like monochromatic orange light although composed monochromatic yellow lights hence paradox puzzled physicists time complex lights composed monochromatic light could look alike physically different called metameres thomas young later proposed paradox could explained colours perceived limited number channels eyes proposed threefold103 trichromatic colour theory maxwell used recently developed linear algebra prove youngs theory monochromatic light stimulating three receptors able equally stimulated three different monochromatic lights fact three different lights demonstrated case104 inventing colour matching experiments colourimetry
maxwell also interested applying theory colour perception namely colour photography stemming directly psychological work colour perception three lights could reproduce perceivable colour colour photographs could produced three coloured filters course 1855 paper maxwell proposed three blackandwhite photographs scene taken green blue filters transparent prints images projected onto screen using three projectors equipped similar filters superimposed screen result would perceived human complete reproduction colours scene105
