sibilance acoustic characteristic fricative affricate consonants higher amplitude pitch made directing stream tongue towards sharp edge teeth held close together consonant uses sibilance called sibilant examples sibilants consonants beginning english words ship chip jump second consonant vision symbols international phonetic alphabet used denote sibilant sounds words respectively specifically sounds chip jump affricates whereas rest fricatives sibilants characteristically intense sound accounts paralinguistic getting ones attention calling someone using psst quieting someone using shhhh
alveolar hissing sibilants back tongue forms narrow channel grooved focus stream intensely resulting high pitch hushing sibilants occasionally termed shibilants english tongue flatter resulting pitch lowercitation needed
broader category stridents include fricatives sibilants sibilants also stridents terms sometimes used interchangeably however terms mean thing english stridents english sibilants high pitched subset stridents english sibilants stridents sibilants lower pitch
stridency refers perceptual intensity sound sibilant consonant obstacle fricatives affricates refers critical role teeth producing sound obstacle airstream nonsibilant fricatives affricates produce characteristic sound directly tongue lips place contact mouth without secondary involvement teeth

sibilant typesedit
sibilants coronal consonants made front part tongue however great deal variety among sibilants tongue shape point contact tongue point contact upper side mouth
following variables affect sibilant sound quality along possible values ordered sharpest highestpitched dullest lowestpitched

tongue shape grooved alveolopalatal palatoalveolar retroflex
place articulation point contact upper side mouth dental dentialveolar alveolar postalveolar palatal
point contact tongue laminal closed laminal nonclosed apical subapical

palatoalveolar domed tongue convex moderately palatalized sounds occur english denoted letter combinations shin chin vision
retroflex flat concave tongue palatalization sounds occur large number varieties also names flat postalveolar apicoalveolar subapical palatal true retroflex sounds dullest lowestpitched sibilants

latter three postalveolar types sounds often known hushing sounds quality opposed hissing alveolar sounds alveolar sounds fact occur several varieties addition normal sound english
