late period
information late egyptian language
writing developed became widespread among egyptian people simplified glyph forms developed resulting hieratic priestly demotic popular scripts variants also suited hieroglyphs papyrus hieroglyphic writing however eclipsed existed alongside forms especially monumental formal writing rosetta stone contains three parallel scripts hieroglyphic demotic greek
late survival
hieroglyphs continued used persian rule intermittent centuries alexander greats conquest egypt ensuing ptolemaic roman periods appears misleading quality comments greek roman writers hieroglyphs came least part response changed political situation believed hieroglyphs functioned distinguish true egyptians foreign conquerors another reason refusal tackle foreign culture terms characterized grecoroman approaches egyptian culture generallycitation needed learned hieroglyphs sacred writing grecoroman authors imagined complex rational system allegorical even magical system transmitting secret mystical knowledgecitation needed

wahshiyyas translation ancient egyptian hieroglyph alphabet


knowledge hieroglyphs lost completely medieval period early attempts decipherment dhulnun almisri wahshiyya 10th century respectively18
early modern tradition decipherment attemtps begins work piero valeriano bolzani 1556 famous early decipherers athanasius kircher lingua aegyptiaca restituta 1643 kircher called hieroglyphics language hitherto unknown europe many pictures letters many riddles sounds short many mazes escaped mountains climbed notions long discredited portions work valuable later scholars kircher helped pioneer egyptology field serious study medieval early modern attempts hampered fundamental assumption hieroglyphs recorded ideas sounds language bilingual texts available symbolic translation could proposed without possibility verification




rosetta stone british museum


breakthrough decipherment came discovery rosetta stone napoleons troops 1799 napoleons egyptian invasion stone presented hieroglyphic demotic version text parallel greek translation plenty material falsifiable studies translation suddenly available early 19th century scholars silvestre sacy johan david åkerblad thomas young studied inscriptions stone able make headway finally jeanfrançois champollion made complete decipherment 1820s lettre dacier 1822 wrote

complex system writing figurative symbolic phonetic text phrase would almost word19

hieroglyphs survive today forms directly half dozen demotic glyphs added greek alphabet writing coptic indirectly inspiration original alphabet ancestral nearly every alphabet ever used including latin alphabet

visually hieroglyphs less figurative represent real illusional elements sometimes stylized simplified generally perfectly recognizable form however sign according context interpreted diverse ways phonogram phonetic reading logogram ideogram semagram determinative semantic reading determinative read phonetic constituent facilitated understanding differentiating word homophones
phonetic reading




hieroglyphs typical graecoroman period


nondeterminative hieroglyphic signs phonetic nature meaning sign read independently visual characteristics according rebus principle example picture could stand english words first person pronoun picture called phonogram word
phonograms formed consonant called uniliteral signs consonants biliteral signs three triliteral signs
twentyfour uniliteral signs make socalled hieroglyphic alphabet egyptian hieroglyphic writing normally indicate vowels unlike cuneiform reason labelled abjad alphabet alphabet without vowels
thus hieroglyphic writing representing pintail duck read egyptian derived main consonants egyptian word duck note halfrings opening left sometimes replaced digit egyptian alef
also possible hieroglyph pintail duck without link meaning order represent phonemes independently vowels could accompany consonants write word complemented context signs detailed text keep watch sꜣṯw hard ground example











characters












character used order signify according context pintail duck appropriate determinative words similar consonants meaning little vertical stroke explained















character used word keep watchclarification needed
arabic script vowels written egyptian hieroglyphs debatable whether vowels written possibly arabic semivowels english could double vowels modern transcriptions added consonants pronunciation example good typically written nefer reflect egyptian vowels obscure merely modern convention likewise commonly transliterated
hieroglyphs written right left left right bottom usual direction right left20 although convenience modern texts often normalized lefttoright order reader must consider direction asymmetrical hieroglyphs turned order determine proper reading order example human animal hieroglyphs face left look left must read left right vice versa idea hieroglyphs face beginning line
many ancient writing systems words separated blanks punctuation marks however certain hieroglyphs appear particularly common words making possible readily distinguish words
uniliteral signs




hieroglyphs amada temple founded tuthmosis


main article transliteration ancient egyptian uniliteral signs
egyptian hieroglyphic script contained uniliterals symbols stood single consonants much like letters english would possible write egyptian words manner signs egyptians never never simplified complex writing true alphabet21
uniliteral glyph unique reading several fell together egyptian developed middle egyptian example foldedcloth glyph seems originally doorbolt glyph sound came pronounced sound lost uniliterals first appear middle egyptian texts
besides uniliteral glyphs also biliteral triliteral signs represent specific sequence three consonants consonants vowels vowel combinations language
phonetic complements
egyptian writing often redundant fact happens frequently word might follow several characters writing sounds order guide reader example word beautiful good perfect written unique triliteral read















































however considerably common triliteral uniliterals word thus written nfrfr still reads merely alphabetic characters adding clarity spelling preceding triliteral hieroglyph
redundant characters accompanying biliteral triliteral signs called phonetic complements complementaries placed front sign rarely sign general rule even framing appearing ancient egyptian scribes consistently avoided leaving large areas blank space writing might additional phonetic complements sometimes even invert order signs would result aesthetically pleasing appearance good scribes attended artistic even religious aspects hieroglyphs would simply view communication tool various examples phonetic complements seen
















complementary placed sign reads meaning tongue



















four complementaries frame triliteral sign scarab beetle reads ḫprj meaning name khepri final glyph determinative ruler


notably phonetic complements also used allow reader differentiate signs homophones always unique reading example symbol seat chair














read according word found presence phonetic complements—and suitable determinative—allows reader know three readings choose




reading













written last character determinative house found meaning seat throne place






















written determinative used female personal names periods meaning isis








reading













wsjr written wsjr phonetic complement read following determinative meaning osiris






reading














ḥtmt written ḥḥtmmt determinative anubis jackal meaning kind wild animal























written determinative flying bird meaning disappear






finally sometimes happens pronunciation words might changed connection ancient egyptian case rare writing adopt compromise notation readings indicated jointly example adjective sweet became middle egyptian write





















bnrj written bnri determinative





fully read pronounced retained order keep written connection ancient word fashion english language words knife victuals longer pronounced written
semantic reading
besides phonetic interpretation characters also read meaning instance logograms spoken ideograms semagrams latter also called determinatives22
logograms
hieroglyph used logogram defines object image logograms therefore frequently used common nouns always accompanied mute vertical stroke indicating status logogram usage vertical stroke explained theory hieroglyphs would ability used logograms logograms accompanied phonetic complements examples

meaning reed



















meaning mountain



cases semantic connection indirect metonymic metaphoric
















meaning character fact represents temple flag standard



















meaning soul character traditional representation bird human head



















meaning flamingo corresponding phonogram means bird associated metonymy color



determinatives
determinatives semagrams semantic symbols specifying meaning placed word mute characters serve clarify word homophonic glyphs common similar procedure existed english words spelling would followed indicator would read would finetune meaning retort chemistry retort rhetoric would thus distinguished
number determinatives exist divinities humans parts human body animals plants certain determinatives possess literal figurative meaning example roll papyrus











used define books also abstract ideas determinative plural shortcut signal three occurrences word plural since egyptian language dual sometimes indicated strokes special character explained
several examples determinatives borrowed book hiéroglyphes reading hieroglyphs jean capart illustrate importance
















nfrw three strokes marks plural literally beautiful young people young military recruits word youngperson determinative symbol











determinative indicating babies children

filling stroke
filling stroke character indicating quadrat would otherwise incomplete
signs joined together
signs contraction several others signs however function existence example forearm hand holds scepter used determinative words meaning direct drive derivatives
doubling
doubling sign indicates dual tripling sign indicates plural
grammatical signs

vertical stroke indicating sign logogram
strokes dual three strokes plural
direct notation flexional endings example













spelling
standard orthography—correct spelling—in egyptian much looser modern languages fact several variants exist almost every word finds

redundancies
omission graphemes ignored whether intentional
substitutions grapheme another impossible distinguish mistake alternate spelling
errors omission drawing signs much problematic writing cursive hieratic writing especially demotic schematization signs extreme

however many apparent spelling errors constitute issue chronology spelling standards varied time writing word kingdom might considerably different kingdom furthermore egyptians perfectly content include older orthography historical spelling alongside newer practices though acceptable english archaic spellings modern texts often ancient spelling errors simply misinterpretations context today hieroglyphicists numerous cataloguing systems notably manuel codage gardiners sign list clarify presence determinatives ideograms ambiguous signs transliteration
