term high definition described series television systems originating august 1936 however systems high definition compared earlier systems based mechanical systems lines resolution ongoing competition companies nations create true hdtv spanned entire 20th century system became last beginning 21st century race continued current systems
british highdefinition service started trials august 1936 regular service november 1936 using mechanical baird line sequential scan later inaccurately rechristened progressive electronic marconiemi line interlaced systems baird system discontinued february 19372 1938 france followed 441line system variants also used number countries ntsc 525line system joined 1941 1949 france introduced even higherresolution standard lines system high definition even todays standards monochrome technical limitations time prevented achieving definition capable systems used interlacing aspect ratio except 240line system progressive actually described time technically correct term sequential 405line system started later changed 405line system adopted time revolutionary idea interlaced scanning overcome flicker problem 240line frame rate 240line system could doubled frame rate would meant transmitted signal would doubled bandwidth unacceptable option video baseband bandwidth required
color broadcasts started similarly higher resolutions first ntsc color system 1953 compatible earlier monochrome systems therefore lines resolution european standards follow 1960s secam color systems added monochrome line broadcasts
nippon hōsō kyōkai japan broadcasting corporation began conducting research unlock fundamental mechanism video sound interactions five human senses 1964 tokyo olympics create hdtv system ended scoring much higher subjective tests ntscs previously dubbed hdtv system color created 1972 included 1125 lines aspect ratio refresh rate society motion picture television engineers smpte headed charles ginsburg became testing study authority hdtv technology international theater smpte would test hdtv systems different companies every conceivable perspective problem combining different formats plagued technology many years

notationedit
hdtv broadcast systems identified three major parameters

frame size pixels defined number horizontal pixels number vertical pixels example 1280 1920 1080 often number horizontal pixels implied context omitted case 720p 1080p
scanning system identified letter progressive scanning interlaced scanning
frame rate identified number video frames second interlaced systems number frames second specified uncommon field rate incorrectly used instead

three parameters used specified following form frame sizescanning systemframe field rate frame sizeframe field ratescanning system22 often frame size frame rate dropped value implied context case remaining numeric parameter specified first followed scanning system
example 1920×1080p25 identifies progressive scanning format frames second frame 1920 pixels wide 1080 pixels high 1080i25 1080i50 notation identifies interlaced scanning format frames fields second frame 1920 pixels wide 1080 pixels high 1080i30 1080i60 notation identifies interlaced scanning format frames fields second frame 1920 pixels wide 1080 pixels high 720p60 notation identifies progressive scanning format frames second frame pixels high 1280 pixels horizontally implied
systems support three scanning rates systems support much wider frame rates 5994i 23976p 2997p 5994p days standard definition television fractional rates often rounded whole numbers 23976p often called 5994i often called high definition television supports fractional slightly different integer rates therefore strict usage notation required avoid ambiguity nevertheless 2997p5994i almost universally called likewise 23976p called
commercial naming product frame rate often dropped implied context 1080i television frame rate also specified without resolution example means progressive scan frames second means interlaced frames second23
single standard hdtv color support colors typically broadcast using 10bits channel color space depending underlying image generating technologies receiver subsequently converted color space using standardized algorithms transmitted directly internet colors typically preconverted 8bit channels additional storage savings assumption viewed srgb computer screen added benefit original broadcasters losses preconversion essentially make files unsuitable professional rebroadcasting
