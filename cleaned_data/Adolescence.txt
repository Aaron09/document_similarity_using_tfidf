upper body teenage structure changed resemble adult form


puberty period several years rapid physical growth psychological changes occur culminating sexual maturity average onset puberty girls boys1819 every persons individual timetable puberty influenced primarily heredity although environmental factors diet exercise also exert influences2021 factors also contribute precocious delayed puberty1221
significant parts pubertal development involve distinctive physiological changes individuals height weight body composition circulatory respiratory systems22 changes largely influenced hormonal activity hormones play organizational role priming body behave certain puberty begins23 active role referring changes hormones adolescence trigger behavioral physical changes24
puberty occurs long process begins surge hormone production turn causes number physical changes stage life characterized appearance development secondary characteristics example deeper voice larger adams apple boys development breasts curved prominent hips girls strong shift hormonal balance towards adult state triggered pituitary gland secretes surge hormonal agents blood stream initiating chain reaction occur male female gonads subsequently activated puts state rapid growth development triggered gonads commence mass production necessary chemicals testes primarily release testosterone ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen production hormones increases gradually sexual maturation boys develop gynecomastia imbalance hormones tissue responsiveness obesity25
facial hair males normally appears specific order puberty first facial hair appear tends grow corners upper typically years age2627 spreads form moustache entire upper followed appearance hair upper part cheeks area lower lip26 hair eventually spreads sides lower border chin rest lower face form full beard26 human biological processes specific order vary among individuals facial hair often present late adolescence around ages appear significantly later2728 develop full facial hair years puberty27 facial hair continues coarser darker thicker another years puberty27
major landmark puberty males spermarche first ejaculation occurs average 1329 females menarche onset menstruation occurs average ages 1320303132 menarche influenced heredity girls diet lifestyle contribute well20 regardless genes girl must certain proportion body attain menarche20 consequently girls highfat diet physically active begin menstruating earlier average girls whose diet contains less whose activities involve reducing exercise ballet gymnastics2021 girls experience malnutrition societies children expected perform physical labor also begin menstruating later ages20
timing puberty important psychological social consequences early maturing boys usually taller stronger friends33 advantage capturing attention potential partners becoming handpicked sports pubescent boys often tend good body image confident secure independent34 late maturing boys less confident poor body image comparing already developed friends peers however early puberty always positive boys early sexual maturation boys accompanied increased aggressiveness surge hormones affect them34 appear older peers pubescent boys face increased social pressure conform adult norms society view emotionally advanced despite fact cognitive social development behind appearance34 studies shown early maturing boys likely sexually active likely participate risky behaviors35
girls early maturation sometimes lead increased selfconsciousness though typical aspect maturing females36 bodies developing advance pubescent girls become insecure dependent36 consequently girls reach sexual maturation early likely peers develop eating disorders anorexia nervosa nearly half american high school girls diets lose weight36 addition girls deal sexual advances older boys emotionally mentally mature37 addition earlier sexual experiences unwanted pregnancies late maturing girls early maturing girls exposed alcohol drug abuse38 experiences tend perform well school inexperienced peers39
girls usually reached full physical development around ages 15–1731940 boys usually complete puberty around ages 16–17194041 increase height beyond postpubertal uncommon girls attain reproductive maturity four years first physical changes puberty appear3 contrast boys accelerate slowly continue grow years first visible pubertal changes3441





approximate outline development periods child teenager development adolescence marked right



growth spurt
adolescent growth spurt rapid increase individuals height weight puberty resulting simultaneous release growth hormones thyroid hormones androgens42 males experience growth spurt years later average females peak height velocity time rapid growth adolescents grow growth rate nearly identical toddler—about inches year males inches females43 addition changes height adolescents also experience significant increase weight marshall 1978 weight gained adolescence constitutes nearly half ones adult body weight43 teenage early adult males continue gain natural muscle growth even puberty34
accelerated growth different body parts happens different times adolescents fairly regular sequence first places grow extremities—the head hands feet—followed arms legs torso shoulders44 nonuniform growth reason adolescent body seem proportion
puberty bones become harder brittle conclusion puberty ends long bones close process called epiphysis ethnic differences skeletal changes example united states america bone density increases significantly among black white adolescents might account decreased likelihood black women developing osteoporosis fewer bone fractures there45
another significant physical changes puberty happen bodily distribution muscle process different females males puberty nearly differences muscle distribution puberty boys grow muscle much faster girls although sexes experience rapid muscle development contrast though sexes experience increase body increase much significant girls frequently increase girls happens years puberty ratio muscle among postpubertal boys around three girls five four help explain differences athletic performance46
pubertal development also affects circulatory respiratory systems adolescents heart lungs increase size capacity changes lead increased strength tolerance exercise differences apparent males tend develop larger hearts lungs higher systolic blood pressure lower resting heart rate greater capacity carrying oxygen blood greater power neutralizing chemical products muscular exercise higher blood hemoglobin blood cells47
despite genetic differences environmental factors play large role biological changes adolescence example girls tend reduce physical activity preadolescence4849 receive inadequate nutrition diets often lack important nutrients iron50 environmental influences turn affect female physical development
reproductionrelated changes
primary characteristics directly related organs males first stages puberty involve growth testes scrotum followed growth penis51 time penis develops seminal vesicles prostate bulbourethral gland also enlarge develop first ejaculation seminal fluid generally occurs year beginning accelerated penis growth although often determined culturally rather biologically since many boys first ejaculation occurs result masturbation44 boys generally fertile adult appearance42
females changes primary characteristics involve growth uterus vagina aspects reproductive system menarche beginning menstruation relatively late development follows long series hormonal changes52 generally girl fully fertile several years menarche regular ovulation follows menarche years53 unlike males therefore females usually appear physically mature capable becoming pregnant
changes secondary characteristics include every change directly related sexual reproduction males changes involve appearance pubic facial body hair deepening voice roughening skin around upper arms thighs increased development sweat glands females secondary changes involve elevation breasts widening hips development pubic underarm hair widening areolae elevation nipples54 changes secondary characteristics take place puberty often referred terms five tanner stages55 named british pediatrician devised categorization system
changes brain
human brain fully developed time person reaches puberty ages brain undergoes changes important implications behavior cognitive development brain reaches adult size time person years age56 thus brain grow size much adolescence however creases brain continue become complex late teens biggest changes folds brain time occur parts cortex process cognitive emotional information56
course adolescence amount white matter brain increases linearly amount grey matter brain follows invertedu pattern57 process called synaptic pruning unnecessary neuronal connections brain eliminated amount grey matter pared however mean brain loses functionality rather becomes efficient increased myelination insulation axons reduction unused pathways58
first areas brain pruned involving primary functions motor sensory areas areas brain involved complex processes lose matter later development include lateral prefrontal cortices among regions59 developmentally significant changes brain occur prefrontal cortex involved decision making cognitive control well higher cognitive functions adolescence myelination synaptic pruning prefrontal cortex increases improving efficiency information processing neural connections prefrontal cortex regions brain strengthened60 leads better evaluation risks rewards well improved control impulses specifically developments dorsolateral prefrontal cortex important controlling impulses planning ahead development ventromedial prefrontal cortex important decision making changes orbitofrontal cortex important evaluating rewards risks
three neurotransmitters play important roles adolescent brain development glutamate dopamine serotonin glutamate excitatory neurotransmitter synaptic pruning occurs adolescence neural connections pruned contain receptors glutamate excitatory neurotransmitters61 early adulthood synaptic balance brain inhibitory excitatory
dopamine associated pleasure attuning environment decisionmaking adolescence dopamine levels limbic system increase input dopamine prefrontal cortex increases62 balance excitatory inhibitory neurotransmitters increased dopamine activity adolescence implications adolescent risktaking vulnerability boredom cognitive development
serotonin neuromodulator involved regulation mood behavior development limbic system plays important role determining rewards punishments processing emotional experience social information changes levels neurotransmitters dopamine serotonin limbic system make adolescents emotional responsive rewards stress corresponding increase emotional variability also increase adolescents vulnerability effect serotonin limited limbic system several serotonin receptors gene expression change dramatically adolescence particularly human frontal prefrontal cortex
cognitive development
adolescence also time rapid cognitive development64 piaget describes adolescence stage life individuals thoughts start taking abstract form egocentric thoughts decrease allows individual think reason wider perspective65 combination behavioural fmri studies demonstrated development executive functions cognitive skills enable control coordination thoughts behaviour generally associated prefrontal cortex66 thoughts ideas concepts developed period life greatly influence ones future life playing major role character personality formation67
biological changes brain structure connectivity within brain interact increased experience knowledge changing social demands produce rapid cognitive growth changes brain particular changes take place varies individuals changes discussed begin puberty shortly skills continue develop adolescent ages dual systems model proposes maturational imbalance development socioemotional system cognitive control systems brain contribute impulsivity behaviors characteristic adolescence68
theoretical perspectives
least major approaches understanding cognitive change adolescence constructivist view cognitive development based work piaget takes quantitative statetheory approach hypothesizing adolescents cognitive improvement relatively sudden drastic second informationprocessing perspective derives study artificial intelligence attempts explain cognitive development terms growth specific components thinking process
improvements cognitive ability
time individuals reached basic thinking abilities comparable adults improvements occur five areas adolescence

attention improvements seen selective attention process focuses stimulus tuning another divided attention ability attention stimuli time also improves6970
memory improvements seen working memory longterm memory71
processing speed adolescents think quickly children processing speed improves sharply five middle adolescence begins level appear change late adolescence adulthood72
organization adolescents aware thought processes mnemonic devices strategies think efficiently73
metacognition

studies since 2005 indicate brain fully formed early twenties74
hypothetical abstract thinking
adolescents thinking less bound concrete events children contemplate possibilities outside realm currently exists manifestation adolescents increased facility thinking possibilities improvement skill deductive reasoning leads development hypothetical thinking provides ability plan ahead future consequences action provide alternative explanations events also makes adolescents skilled debaters reason friends parents assumptions adolescents also develop sophisticated understanding probability
appearance systematic abstract thinking another notable aspect cognitive development adolescence example adolescents find easier children comprehend sorts higherorder abstract logic inherent puns proverbs metaphors analogies increased facility permits appreciate ways language used convey multiple messages satire metaphor sarcasm children younger nine often cannot comprehend sarcasm all75 also permits application advanced reasoning logical processes social ideological matters interpersonal relationships politics philosophy religion morality friendship faith fairness honesty
metacognition
third gain cognitive ability involves thinking thinking process referred metacognition often involves monitoring ones cognitive activity thinking process adolescents improvements knowledge thinking patterns lead better selfcontrol effective studying also relevant social cognition resulting increased introspection selfconsciousness intellectualization sense thought ones thoughts rather freudian definition defense mechanism adolescents much better able children understand people complete control mental activity able introspect lead forms adolescent egocentrism results distinct problems thinking imaginary audience personal fable likely peak fifteen along selfconsciousness general76
related metacognition abstract thought perspectivetaking involves sophisticated theory mind77 adolescents reach stage social perspectivetaking understand thoughts actions person influence another person even personally involved78
relativistic thinking
compared children adolescents likely question others assertions less likely accept facts absolute truths experience outside family circle learn rules taught absolute fact relativistic begin differentiate rules instituted common sense—not touching stove—and based culturallyrelative standards codes etiquette dating certain delineation younger children make lead period questioning authority domains79
wisdom
wisdom capacity insight judgment developed experience80 increases ages fourteen twentyfive levels thus adolescenceadulthood transition individuals acquire type wisdom associated wisdom intelligence adolescents improve substantially tests since scores relative others group relative standing usually change—everyone matures approximately rate
risktaking
injuries sustained adolescents related risky behavior crashes alcohol unprotected great deal research done cognitive emotional processes underlying adolescent risktaking addressing question important distinguish whether adolescents likely engage risky behaviors prevalence whether make riskrelated decisions similarly differently adults cognitive processing perspective whether processes value different things thus arrive different conclusions behavioral decisionmaking theory proposes adolescents adults weigh potential rewards consequences action however research shown adolescents seem give weight rewards particularly social rewards adults81
research seems favor hypothesis adolescents adults think risk similar ways hold different values thus come different conclusions argued evolutionary benefits increased propensity risktaking adolescence example without willingness take risks teenagers would motivation confidence necessary leave family origin addition population perspective advantage group individuals willing take risks methods counterbalancing conservative elements typical received knowledge held older adults risktaking also reproductive advantages adolescents newfound priority sexual attraction dating risktaking required impress potential mates research also indicates baseline sensation seeking affect risktaking behavior throughout lifespan8283
given potential consequences engaging sexual behavior somewhat risky particularly adolescents unprotected using poor birth control methods withdrawal multiple sexual partners poor communication aspects sexual behavior increase individual andor social risk qualities adolescents lives often correlated risky sexual behavior include higher rates experienced abuse lower rates parental support monitoring84
inhibition
related increased tendency risktaking adolescents show impaired behavioral inhibition including deficits extinction learning85 important implications engaging risky behavior unsafe illicit drug adolescents less likely inhibit actions negative outcomes future86 phenomenon also consequences behavioral treatments based principle extinction exposure therapy anxiety drug addiction8788 suggested impaired inhibition specifically extinction help explain adolescent propensity relapse drugseeking even following behavioral treatment addiction89

addition sharing household chores certain cultures expect adolescents share familys financial responsibilities according family economic financial education specialists adolescents develop sound money management skills practices saving spending money well planning ahead future economic goals199 differences families distribution financial responsibilities provision allowance reflect various social background circumstances intrafamilial processes influenced cultural norms values well business sector market economy given society200 instance many developing countries common children attend fewer years formal schooling reach adolescence begin working201
adolescence time frequently marked participation workforce number adolescents workforce much lower years past result increased accessibility perceived importance formal higher education202 example half 16yearolds china employed 1980 whereas less fourth cohort employed 1990202
furthermore amount time adolescents spend work leisure activities varies greatly culture result cultural norms expectations well various socioeconomic factors american teenagers spend less time school working time leisure activities—which include playing sports socializing caring appearance—than adolescents many countries203 differences influenced cultural values education amount responsibility adolescents expected assume family community
time management financial roles social responsibilities adolescents therefore closely connected education sector processes career development adolescents well cultural norms social expectations many ways adolescents experiences assumed social roles responsibilities determine length quality initial pathway adult roles204
