history serveredit
original specification file transfer protocol written abhay bhushan published april 1971 1980 predecessor tcpip2 protocol later replaced tcpip version june 1980 october 1985 current specification several proposed standards amend example 1579 february 1994 enables firewallfriendly passive mode 2228 june 1997 proposes security extensions 2428 september 1998 adds support ipv6 defines type passive mode4
protocol overviewedit
communication data transferedit




illustration starting passive connection using port


active passive mode determines data connection established5 cases client creates control connection random usually unprivileged port server command port

active mode client starts listening incoming data connections server port sends command port inform server port listening server initiates data channel client port server data port
situations client behind firewall unable accept incoming connections passive mode used mode client uses control connection send pasv command server receives server address server port number server56 client uses open data connection arbitrary client port server address server port number received7

modes updated september 1998 support ipv6 changes introduced passive mode time updating extended passive mode8
server responds control connection threedigit status codes ascii optional text message example means last command successful numbers represent code response optional text represents humanreadable explanation request need account storing file1 ongoing transfer file data data connection aborted using interrupt message sent control connection
transferring data network four data representations used234

ascii mode used text data converted needed sending hosts character representation 8bit ascii transmission necessary receiving hosts character representation consequence mode inappropriate files contain data plain text
image mode commonly called binary mode sending machine sends file byte byte recipient stores bytestream receives image mode support recommended implementations
ebcdic mode used plain text hosts using ebcdic character
local mode allows computers identical setups send data proprietary format without need convert ascii

text files different format control record structure options provided features designed facilitate files containing telnet
data transfer done three modes12

stream mode data sent continuous stream relieving processing rather processing left endoffile indicator needed unless data divided records
block mode breaks data several blocks block header byte count data field passes tcp4
compressed mode data compressed using simple algorithm usually runlength encoding

software also implements deflatebased compressed mode sometimes called mode command enables mode described internet draft standardized9
loginedit
login uses normal username password scheme granting access2 username sent server using user command password sent using pass command2 sequence unencrypted wire vulnerable network sniffing attack10 information provided client accepted server server send greeting client session commence2 server supports users without providing login credentials server authorize limited access sessions2
anonymous ftpedit
host provides service provide anonymous access2 users typically service anonymous lowercase casesensitive servers account prompted user name although users commonly asked send email address instead password3 verification actually performed supplied data11 many hosts whose purpose provide software updates allow anonymous logins3
firewall traversaledit
normally transfers data server connect back client port command sent client problematic nats firewalls allow connections internet towards internal hosts12 nats additional complication representation addresses port number port command refer internal hosts address port rather public address port
approaches solve problem client server pasv command causes data connection established client server12 widely used modern clients another approach alter values port command using applicationlevel gateway purpose12
differences httpedit
http essentially fixes bugs made inconvenient many small ephemeral transfers typical pages
stateful control connection maintains current working directory flags transfer requires secondary connection data transferred passive mode secondary connection client server whereas default active mode connection server client apparent role reversal active mode random port numbers transfers firewalls gateways hard time http stateless multiplexes control data single connection client server wellknown port numbers trivially passes gateways simple firewalls manage
setting control connection quite slow roundtrip delays sending required commands awaiting responses customary bring control connection hold open multiple file transfers rather drop reestablish session afresh time contrast http originally dropped connection transfer cheap http subsequently gained ability reuse connection multiple transfers conceptual model still independent requests rather session
transferring data connection control connection idle transfer takes long firewall decide control connection dead stop tracking effectively breaking connection confusing download single http connection idle requests normal expected connections dropped timeout
browser supportedit
common browsers retrieve files hosted servers although support protocol extensions ftps313 ftp—rather http—url supplied accessible contents remote server presented manner similar used content fullfeatured client within firefox form extension called fireftp
syntaxedit
syntax described 1738 taking form ftpuserpasswordhostporturlpath bracketed parts optional
example ftppublicftpserversexamplecommydirectorymyfiletxt represents file myfiletxt directory mydirectory server publicftpserversexamplecom resource ftpuser001secretpasswordprivateftpserversexamplecommydirectorymyfiletxt adds specification username password must used access resource
details specifying username password found browsers documentation firefox14 internet explorer15 default browsers passive pasv mode easily traverses enduser firewalls
variation existed different browsers treat path resolution cases nonroot home directory user16
securityedit
designed secure protocol many security weaknesses17 1999 authors 2577 listed vulnerability following problems

brute force attack
bounce attack
packet capture
port stealing guessing next open port usurping legitimate connection
spoofing attack
username enumeration

encrypt traffic transmissions clear text usernames passwords commands data read anyone able perform packet capture sniffing network217 problem common many internet protocol specifications smtp telnet imap designed prior creation encryption mechanisms ssl4
common solutions problem include

using secure versions insecure protocols ftps instead telnets instead telnet
using different secure protocol handle file transfer protocol secure copy protocol
using secure tunnel secure shell virtual private network

sshedit
practice tunneling normal session secure shell connection17 uses multiple connections unusual tcpip protocol still particularly difficult tunnel many clients attempting tunnel control channel initial clienttoserver connection port protect channel data transferred software either sets connections data channels thus confidentiality integrity protection
otherwise necessary client software specific knowledge protocol monitor rewrite control channel messages autonomously open packet forwardings data channels software packages support mode include
