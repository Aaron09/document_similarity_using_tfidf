unlike semiautomatic firearms require trigger pull round fired machine designed fire long trigger held nowadays term restricted relatively heavy weapons able provide continuous frequent bursts automatic fire long ammunition lasts machine guns normally used personnel aircraft light vehicles provide suppressive fire either directly indirectly commonly mounted fast attack vehicles technicals provide heavy mobile firepower armored vehicles tanks engaging targets small justify primary weaponry fast effectively engage aircraft defensive armament strafing ground targets though fighter aircraft true machine guns mostly supplanted largecaliber rotary guns
machine guns practice sustained fire almost continuously hours automatic weapons overheat less minute become practically machine guns fire open bolt permit cooling breech bursts also usually either barrel cooling system slowheating heavyweight barrel removable barrels allow barrel replaced
although subdivided light medium heavy generalpurpose even lightest machine guns tend substantially larger heavier standard infantry arms medium heavy machine guns either mounted tripod vehicle carried foot machine associated equipment tripod ammunition spare barrels require additional crew members
light machine guns designed provide mobile fire support squad typically aircooled weapons fitted magazine drum bipod fullsize rifle rounds modern examples often intermediate rounds medium machine guns fullsized rifle rounds designed used fixed positions mounted tripod heavy machine term originating world describe heavyweight medium machine guns persisted world japanese hotchkiss m1914 clones today however used refer automatic weapons caliber least less generalpurpose machine usually lightweight medium machine either used bipod drum light machine role tripod belt feed medium machine role
machine guns usually simple iron sights though optics becoming common common aiming system direct fire alternate solid ball rounds tracer ammunition rounds usually tracer round every four ball rounds shooters trajectory walk fire target direct fire soldiers

operationedit




direct impingement






piston


many machine guns locked breech type follow cycle

pulling manually electrically bolt assemblybolt carrier rearward cocking lever point bolt carrier engages sear stays rear position trigger activated making bolt carrier move forward
loading fresh round chamber locking bolt
firing round firing striker except aircraft medium calibre using electric ignition primers hitting primer ignites powder bolt reaches locked position
unlocking removing spent case chamber ejecting weapon bolt moving rearward
loading next round firing chamber usually recoil spring also known main spring tension pushes bolt back battery strips round feeding device belt
cycle repeated long trigger activated operator releasing trigger resets trigger mechanism engaging sear weapon stops firing bolt carrier fully rear

operation basically locked breech automatic firearms regardless means activating mechanisms also multichambered formats revolver cannon automatic weapons including many submachine guns schwarzlose machine lock instead simple blowback type delayed blowback
