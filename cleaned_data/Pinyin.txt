tonesedit




relative pitch changes four tones


pinyin system also uses diacritics mark four tones mandarin diacritic placed letter represents syllable nucleus unless letter missing many books printed china fonts vowels tone marks rendered different font surrounding text tending give pinyin texts typographically ungainly appearance style likely rooted early technical limitations many believe pinyins rules call practice also latin alpha rather standard style letter found fonts problem happens g—often written u0261 official rules hanyu pinyin however specify practice3833418

second tone rising highrising tone denoted acute accent




third tone fallingrising tone marked caronháček rounded breve though breve sometimes substituted font limitations




fourth tone falling highfalling tone represented grave accent

rules placing tone markedit
briefly tone mark always placed order—a exception tone mark placed instead pinyin tone marks appear primarily nucleus syllable example kuài initial medial nucleus coda exception syllabic nasals like nucleus syllable consonant diacritic carried written dummy vowel
nucleus written medial coda nucleus dropped writing case coda consonant vowel left medial takes diacritic however coda vowel coda rather medial takes diacritic absence written nucleus occurs syllables ending absence written nucleus finals priority receiving tone marker long vowels medial takes diacritic
algorithm find correct vowel letter follows40

take tone mark
takes tone mark
otherwise second vowel takes tone mark

worded differently

take tone mark case mark goes
otherwise vowels case second vowel takes tone mark

tone written tittle omitted
phonological intuitionedit
placement tone marker written letters appears also inferred nature vowel sound medial final rule tone marker goes spelled vowel nearsemivowel exception triphthongs spelled vowel letters semivowels tone marker goes second spelled vowel
specifically spelling diphthong begins serves nearsemivowel letter take tone marker likewise spelling diphthong ends representing nearsemivowel letter receive tone marker triphthong spelled three replaced start syllable first third letters coincide nearsemivowels hence receive tone marker letter written represent triphthongs middle nonsemivowel sound tone marker goes final second vowel letter
using tone colorsedit
addition tone number mark tone color suggested visual learning although formal standards number different color schemes

dummitts color scheme first used tone tone orange tone green tone blue neutral tone black41
unimelb color scheme tone blue tone green tone purple tone neutral tone grey
hanping color scheme tone blue tone green tone orange tone neutral tone grey42
pleco color scheme tone tone green tone blue tone purple neutral tone grey
thomas color scheme tone green tone blue tone tone black neutral tone grey

third tone exceptionsedit
spoken chinese third tone often pronounced half third tone pitch rise additionally third tones appear consecutively nǐhǎo hello first syllable pronounced second tone pinyin words like hello still written third tones nǐhǎo
soundedit
umlaut placed letter occurs initials order represent sound necessary order distinguish front high rounded vowel donkey back high rounded vowel oven tonal markers added umlaut
however used contexts could represent front high rounded vowel namely letters example sound word fish transcribed pinyin simply practice opposed wade–giles always uses tongyong pinyin always uses whereas wade–giles needs umlaut distinguish pinyin pinyin ambiguity cannot arise pinyin convenient form used instead genuine ambiguities happen nunü lulü distinguished umlaut
many fonts output methods support umlaut cannot place tone marks likewise using input methods difficult present simple many keyboard layouts reasons sometimes used instead convention example common cellphones instead additionally stores china instead transliteration names drawback tone marks letter
also presents problem transcribing names passports affecting people names consist sound particularly people surname fairly common surname particularly compared surname previously practice varied among different passport issuing offices transcribing others used july 2012 ministry public security standardized practice passports4344
although written written ambiguous correct according rules used instead however chinese input methods microsoft pinyin support nvelve typing nuelue
pinyin taiwanedit
also chinese language romanization taiwan
taiwan republic china adopted tongyong pinyin modification hanyu pinyin official romanization system national level october 2002 january 2009 switched hanyu pinyin tongyong pinyin common phonetic variant pinyin developed taiwan designed romanize languages dialects spoken island addition mandarin chinese kuomintang party resisted adoption preferring hanyu pinyin system used mainland china general internationally romanization preferences quickly became associated issues national identity preferences split along party lines affiliated parties panblue coalition supported hanyu pinyin democratic progressive party affiliated parties pangreen coalition favored tongyong pinyin
tongyong pinyin made official system administrative order allowed adoption local governments voluntary localities governments controlled notably taipei hsinchu kinmen county overrode order converted hanyu pinyin january 2009 nationallevel switch45 though slightly different capitalization convention mainland china areas taiwan adopted tongyong pinyin consistent national policy 2009 switch many street signs taiwan today still display tongyong pinyin especially northern taiwan display hanyu pinyin still unusual spellings street signs buildings derived older wade–giles mps2 systems
adoption hanyu pinyin official romanization system taiwan preclude official retention earlier spellings international familiarity retention spelling taipei taibei pinyin systems even continuation name taipei municipality created 2010 personal names taiwanese passports honor choices taiwanese citizens often prefer wade–giles romanization personal names transition hanyu pinyin official also necessarily gradual universities government entities retain earlier spellings longestablished names budget restraints preclude widespread replacement signage stationery every area primary education taiwan continues teach pronunciation using zhuyin mandarin phonetic symbols
comparison orthographiesedit
pinyin used foreign students learning chinese second language
pinyin assigns latin letters sound values quite different languages drawn criticism lead confusion uninformed speakers apply either native english assumed pronunciations words however problem limited pinyin since many languages latin alphabet natively also assign different values letters recent study chinese writing literacy concluded large pinyin represents chinese sounds better wade–giles system fewer extra marks45
