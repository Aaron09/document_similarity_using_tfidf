history developmentedit
first recorded mention terms chest voice head voice around 13th century distinguished throat voice pectoris guttoris capitis—at time likely head voice referred falsetto register writers johannes garlandia jerome moravia14 terms later adopted within canto italian opera singing method chest voice identified lowest head voice highest three vocal registers chest passagio head registers15 approach still taught vocal pedagogists today another current popular approach based canto model divide womens voices three registers mens voices divided chest register head register falsetto register womans voices chest register middle register head register pedagogists teach head register vocal technique used singing describe resonance felt singers head16
however knowledge physiology increased past hundred years understanding physical process singing vocal production result many vocal pedagogists ralph appelman indiana university william vennard university southern california redefined even abandoned terms chest voice head voice15 particular terms chest register head register become controversial since vocal registration commonly seen today product laryngeal function unrelated physiology chest lungs head reason many vocal pedagogists argue meaningless speak registers produced chest head argue vibratory sensations felt areas resonance phenomena described terms related vocal resonance registers vocal pedagogists prefer terms chest voice head voice term register view believes problems people identify register problems really problems resonance adjustment view also alignment views academic fields study vocal registration including speech pathology phonetics linguistics although methods still current vocal pedagogical practice tends adopt newer scientific view also vocal pedagogists take ideas viewpoints12
contemporary term chest voice often refers specific kind vocal coloration vocal timbre classical singing limited entirely lower part modal register normal voice within forms singing chest voice often applied throughout modal register chest timbre wonderful array sounds singers vocal interpretive palette17 however overly strong chest voice higher registers attempt higher notes chest lead forcing forcing lead consequently vocal deterioration18

european classical music opera voices treated like musical instruments composers write vocal music must understanding skills talents vocal properties singers voice classification process human singing voices evaluated thereby designated voice types qualities include limited vocal range vocal weight vocal tessitura vocal timbre vocal transition points breaks lifts within voice considerations physical characteristics speech level scientific testing vocal registration19 science behind voice classification developed within european classical music slow adapting modern forms singing voice classification often used within opera associate possible roles potential voices currently several different systems within classical music including german fach system choral music system among many others system universally applied accepted15
however classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories women typically divided three groups soprano mezzosoprano contralto usually divided four groups countertenor tenor baritone bass considering voices prepubescent children eighth term treble applied within major categories several subcategories identify specific vocal qualities like coloratura facility vocal weight differentiate voices12
noted within choral music singers voices divided solely basis vocal range choral music commonly divides vocal parts high voices within satb soprano alto tenor bass result typical choral situation gives many opportunities misclassification occur12 since people medium voices must assigned part either high mezzosoprano must sing soprano alto baritone must sing tenor bass either option present problems singer singers fewer dangers singing singing high20

vocal techniqueedit


play media


realtime vocal tract singing


singing done proper vocal technique integrated coordinated effectively coordinates physical processes singing four physical processes involved producing vocal sound respiration phonation resonation articulation processes occur following sequence

breath taken
sound initiated larynx
vocal resonators receive sound influence
articulators shape sound recognizable units

although four processes often considered separately studied actual practice merge coordinated function effective singer speaker rarely reminded process involved mind body coordinated perceives resulting unified function many vocal problems result lack coordination within process22
since singing coordinated difficult discuss individual technical areas processes without relating others example phonation comes perspective connected respiration articulators affect resonance resonators affect vocal folds vocal folds affect breath control forth vocal problems often result breakdown part coordinated process causes voice teachers frequently focus intensively area process student issue resolved however areas singing much result coordinated functions hard discuss traditional heading like phonation resonation articulation respiration
voice student become aware physical processes make singing processes function student begins task trying coordinate inevitably students teachers become concerned area technique another various processes progress different rates resulting imbalance lack coordination areas vocal technique seem depend strongly students ability coordinate various functions are12

extending vocal range maximum potential
developing consistent vocal production consistent tone quality
developing flexibility agility
achieving balanced vibrato

developing singing voiceedit
singing skill requires highly developed muscle reflexes singing require much muscle strength require high degree muscle coordination individuals develop voices careful systematic practice songs vocal exercises vocal exercises several purposes including12 warming voice extending vocal range lining voice horizontally vertically acquiring vocal techniques legato staccato control dynamics rapid figurations learning sing wide intervals comfortably singing trills singing melismas correcting vocal faults
vocal pedagogists instruct students exercise voices intelligent manner singers thinking constantly kind sound making kind sensations feeling singing22
learning sing activity benefits involvement instructor singer hear sounds inside head others hear outside therefore wise guide tell student kinds sounds producing guides singer understand internal sounds correspond desired sounds required style singing student aims recreatecitation needed
extending vocal rangeedit
important goal vocal development learn sing natural limits26 ones vocal range without obvious distracting changes quality technique vocal pedagogists teach singer achieve goal physical processes involved singing laryngeal action breath support resonance adjustment articulatory movement effectively working together vocal pedagogists believe coordinating processes establishing good vocal habits comfortable tessitura voice slowly expanding range3
three factors significantly affect ability sing higher lower

energy factor energy several connotations refers total response body making sound dynamic relationship breathingin muscles breathingout muscles known breath support mechanism amount breath pressure delivered vocal folds resistance pressure dynamic level sound
space factor space refers size inside mouth position palate larynx generally speaking singers mouth opened wider higher sings internal space position soft palate larynx widened relaxing throat vocal pedagogists describe feeling like beginning yawn
depth factor depth connotations refers actual physical sensations depth body vocal mechanism mental concepts depth related tone quality

mckinney says three factors expressed three basic rules sing higher must energy sing lower must less sing higher must space sing lower must less sing higher must depth sing lower must less12
postureedit
singing process functions best certain physical conditions body place ability move body freely obtain needed quantity seriously affected posture various parts breathing mechanism sunken chest position limit capacity lungs tense abdominal wall inhibit downward travel diaphragm good posture allows breathing mechanism fulfill basic function efficiently without undue expenditure energy good posture also makes easier initiate phonation tune resonators proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension body vocal pedagogists also noted singers assume good posture often provides greater sense selfassurance poise performing audiences also tend respond better singers good posture habitual good posture also ultimately improves overall health body enabling better blood circulation preventing fatigue stress body3
eight components ideal singing posture

feet slightly apart
legs straight knees slightly bent
hips facing straight forward
spine aligned
abdomen flat
chest comfortably forward
shoulders back
head facing straight forward

breathing breath supportedit
natural breathing three stages breathingin period breathing period resting recovery period stages usually consciously controlled within singing four stages breathing breathingin period inhalation setting controls period suspension controlled exhalation period phonation recovery period
stages must conscious control singer become conditioned reflexes many singers abandon conscious controls reflexes fully conditioned ultimately leads chronic vocal problems27
vibratoedit
vibrato technique sustained note wavers quickly consistently higher lower pitch giving note slight quaver vibrato pulse wave sustained tone vibrato occurs naturally result proper breath support relaxed vocal apparatus28 studies shown vibrato result neuromuscular tremor vocal folds 1922 schoen first make comparison vibrato tremor change amplitude lack automatic control half rate normal muscular discharge29 singers vibrato means expression many successful artists sing deep rich vibrato
