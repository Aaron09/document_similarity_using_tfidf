visual system human brain slow process information images slipping across retina degrees second25 thus able moving brain must compensate motion head turning eyes frontaleyed animals small area retina high visual acuity fovea centralis covers degrees visual angle people clear view world brain must turn eyes image object regard falls fovea failure make movements correctly lead serious visual degradation
eyes allows brain determine depth distance object called stereovision gives sense threedimensionality vision eyes must point accurately enough object regard falls corresponding points retinas stimulate stereovision otherwise double vision might occur persons congenitally crossed eyes tend ignore eyes vision thus suffer double vision stereovision movements controlled muscles attached allow elevate depress converge diverge roll muscles controlled voluntarily involuntarily track objects correct simultaneous head movements
extraocular musclesedit
main article extraocular muscles
muscles control movements lateral rectus medial rectus inferior rectus superior rectus inferior oblique superior oblique muscles exert different tensions torque exerted globe causes turn almost pure rotation millimeter translation26 thus considered undergoing rotations single point center
rapid movementedit
main article rapid movement sleep
rapid movement typically refers sleep stage vivid dreams occur stage eyes move rapidly unique form movement
saccadesedit
main article saccade
saccades quick simultaneous movements eyes direction controlled frontal lobe brain irregular drifts movements smaller saccade larger microsaccade subtend tenth degree
microsaccadesedit
main article microsaccade
even looking intently single spot eyes drift around ensures individual photosensitive cells continually stimulated different degrees without changing input cells would otherwise stop generating output microsaccades move total adult humans
vestibuloocular reflexedit
main article vestibuloocular reflex
vestibuloocular reflex reflex movement stabilizes images retina head movement producing movement direction opposite head movement response neural input vestibular system inner thus maintaining image center visual field example head moves right eyes move left applies head movements left right tilt right left give input ocular muscles maintain visual stability
smooth pursuit movementedit
main article pursuit movement
eyes also follow moving object around tracking less accurate vestibuloocular reflex requires brain process incoming visual information supply feedback following object moving constant speed relatively easy though eyes often make saccadic jerks keep smooth pursuit movement move 100°s adult humans
difficult visually estimate speed light conditions moving unless another point reference determining speed
optokinetic reflexedit
main article optokinetic response
optokinetic reflex optokinetic nystagmus stabilizes image retina visual feedback induced entire visual scene drifts across retina eliciting rotation direction velocity minimizes motion image retina gaze direction deviates forward heading compensatory saccade induced reset gaze centre visual field

eyes converge point object


creature binocular vision looks object eyes must rotate around vertical axis projection image centre retina eyes look nearby object eyes rotate towards convergence object farther away rotate away divergence
pupil constrictionedit
lenses cannot refract light rays edges well closer center image produced lens therefore somewhat blurry around edges spherical aberration minimized screening peripheral light rays looking betterfocused center pupil serves purpose constricting focused nearby objects small apertures also give increase depth field allowing broader range focus vision pupil dual purpose near vision reduce spherical aberration increase depth field28
accommodation lensedit
changing curvature lens carried ciliary muscles surrounding lens process called accommodation accommodation narrows inner diameter ciliary body actually relaxes fibers suspensory ligament attached periphery lens allows lens relax convex globular shape convex lens refracts light strongly focuses divergent light rays near objects onto retina allowing closer objects brought better focus2829
