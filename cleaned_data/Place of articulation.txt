overviewedit
human voice produces sounds following manner12

pressure lungs creates steady flow trachea windpipe larynx voice pharynx back throat
vocal folds larynx vibrate creating fluctuations pressure known sound waves
resonances vocal tract modify waves according position shape lips tongue soft palate speech organs creating formant regions different qualities sonorant voiced sound
mouth nose openings radiate sound waves environment

larynxedit
larynx voice cylindrical framework cartilage serves anchor vocal folds muscles vocal folds contract airflow lungs impeded vocal folds forced apart increasing pressure lungs process continues periodic cycle felt vibration buzzing singing vibration frequency vocal folds determines pitch sound produced voiced phonemes pure vowels definition distinguished buzzing sound periodic oscillation vocal cords
lips mouth used similar create similar sound toddler trumpeter demonstrate rubber balloon inflated tied stretched tightly across neck produces squeak buzz depending tension across neck level pressure inside balloon similar actions similar results occur vocal cords contracted relaxed across larynx
place articulation passiveedit
passive place articulation place stationary part vocal tract articulation occurs anywhere lips upper teeth gums roof mouth back throat although continuum several contrastive areas languages distinguish consonants articulating different areas languages contrast sounds within area unless feature contrasts well following areas contrastive

upper labial
upper teeth either edge teeth inner surface dental
alveolar ridge line behind teeth alveolar
back alveolar ridge postalveolar
hard palate roof mouth palatal
soft palate back roof mouth velar
uvula hanging entrance throat uvular
throat pharynx pharyngeal
epiglottis entrance windpipe voice epiglottal

regions strictly separated instance sounds many languages surface tongue contacts relatively large area back upper teeth alveolar ridge common enough received name dentialveolar likewise alveolar postalveolar regions merge hard soft palate soft palate uvula adjacent regions terms like prevelar intermediate palatal velar postvelar velar uvular upper lower pharyngeal used specify precisely articulation takes place however although language contrast prevelar postvelar sounds also contrast palatal uvular sounds type consonant contrasts limited number always exact location
place articulation activeedit

bilabial consonants lips move articulatory gesture brings lips together convention lower said active upper passive similarly linguolabial consonants tongue contacts upper upper actively moving meet tongue nonetheless tongue conventionally said active passive reason parts mouth vocal tract typically active vocal tract typically passive
dorsal gestures different parts body tongue contact different parts roof mouth cannot independently controlled subsumed term dorsal unlike coronal gestures involving front tongue flexible
epiglottis active contacting pharynx passive contacted aryepiglottal folds distinctions made laryngeal areas difficult observe subject ongoing investigation several stillunidentified combinations thought possible
glottis acts upon sometimes fuzzy line glottal aryepiglottal epiglottal consonants phonation uses areas
unlike passive articulation continuum five discrete active articulators labial consonants flexible front tongue coronal consonants laminal apical subapical middle–back tongue dorsal consonants root tongue together epiglottis pharyngeal radical consonants glottis glottal consonants articulators discrete independently work together called coarticulation distinction however various coronal articulations laminal apical subapical continuum without clear boundaries

precise vocabulary compounding places articulation sometimes seen however usually reduced passive articulation generally sufficient thus dorsal–palatal dorsal–velar dorsal–uvular usually called palatal velar uvular ambiguity additional terms invented subapical–palatal commonly called retroflex
note additional shades passive articulation sometimes specified using post example prepalatal near border postalveolar region hard palate prevelar back hard palate also postpalatal even mediopalatal middle hard palate postvelar near border soft palate uvula useful precise description sounds articulated somewhat farther forward back prototypical consonant purpose fronted retracted diacritics used however additional shade needed phonemically distinguish consonants single language3
homorganic consonantsedit
main article homorganic consonant
consonants place articulation alveolar sounds english said homorganic similarly labial velar homorganic homorganic nasal rule instance assimilation operates many languages nasal consonant must homorganic following stop english intolerable implausible another example found yoruba present tense hide hiding present sleep nsun sleeping
central lateral articulationedit
main article lateral consonant
tongue contacts mouth surface dimensions length width points articulation along length considered however articulation varies along width well airstream directed center tongue consonant said central however deflected side escaping side tongue side teeth said lateral nonetheless simplicitys sake place articulation assumed point along length tongue consonant addition said central lateral consonant lateral alveolar like english tongue contacts alveolar ridge allows flow side lateral palatal like castilian spanish indigenous australian languages contrast dental alveolar retroflex palatal laterals many native american languages lateral fricatives affricates well
coarticulationedit
languages consonants simultaneous places articulation called coarticulation doubly articulated articulators must independently movable therefore major categories labial coronal dorsal pharyngeal
common doubly articulated consonants labial–velar stops like less commonly found throughout western africa central africa combinations rare include labial–postalveolar stops found distinct consonants single language guinea uvular–epiglottal stop found somali
commonly coarticulation involves secondary articulation approximantic nature articulations similar labialized labial palatalized velar case english velar consonant secondary labial articulation
common coarticulations include

labialization rounding lips producing obstruction english
palatalization raising body tongue toward hard palate producing obstruction russian
velarization raising back tongue toward soft palate velum english dark also transcribed
pharyngealization constriction throat pharynx arabic emphatic

production vowelsedit
vowel phoneme airflow impeded mostly voicing action vocal cords
welldefined fundamental frequency provided vocal cords voiced phonemes convenience necessity since strictly unvoiced whisper still quite intelligible interest therefore focused modulations additions fundamental tone parts vocal apparatus determined variable dimensions oral pharyngeal even nasal cavities
formantsedit
formants resonant frequencies vocal tract emphasize particular voice harmonics near frequency resonance turbulent nonperiodic energy noise near formant frequency case whispered speech formants tell listener vowel spoken
