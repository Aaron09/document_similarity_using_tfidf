evolution 9000 standardsedit
9000 standard continually revised standing technical committees advisory groups receive feedback professionals implementing standard
1987 versionedit
90001987 structure standard 5750 three models quality management systems selection based scope activities organization

90011987 model quality assurance design development production installation servicing companies organizations whose activities included creation products
90021987 model quality assurance production installation servicing basically material 9001 without covering creation products
90031987 model quality assurance final inspection test covered final inspection finished product concern product produced

90001987 also influenced existing defense standards specs wellsuited manufacturing emphasis tended placed conformance procedures rather overall process management likely actual intentcitation needed
1994 versionedit
90001994 emphasized quality assurance preventive actions instead checking final product continued require evidence compliance documented procedures first edition downside companies tended implement requirements creating shelfloads procedure manuals becoming burdened bureaucracy companies adapting improving processes could actually impeded quality systemcitation needed
2000 versionedit
90012000 replaced three former standards 1994 issue 9001 9002 9003 design development procedures required company fact engage creation products 2000 version sought make radical change thinking actually placing front centre concept process management monitoring optimisation companys tasks activities instead inspection final product 2000 version also demanded involvement upper executives order integrate quality business system avoid delegation quality functions junior administrators another goal improve effectiveness process performance metrics numerical measurement effectiveness tasks activities expectations continual process improvement tracking customer satisfaction made explicit
9000 requirements include

auditingedit
types auditing required become registered standard auditing external certification body external audit audits internal staff trained process internal audits continual process review assessment verify system working supposed find improve correct prevent problems identified considered healthier internal auditors audit outside usual management line bring degree independence judgments
1994 standard auditing process could adequately addressed performing conformance auditing

tell describe business process
show says reference procedure manuals
prove happened exhibit evidence documented records

2000 standard uses different approach auditors expected beyond mere auditing rote conformance focusing risk status importance means expected make judgments effective rather merely adhering formally prescribed difference previous standard explained thus

1994 version question broad manual says whereas 2000 version questions specific process help achieve stated objectives good process better

debate effectiveness 9000 commonly centers following questions

quality principles 9001 value
help implement 9001compliant quality management system
help obtain 9001 certification

effectiveness system implemented depends number factors significant

commitment senior management monitor control improve quality organizations implement system without desire commitment often take cheapest road certificate wall ignore problem areas uncovered audits
well system integrates current business practices many organizations implement make system cookiecutter quality manual instead creating manual documents existing practices adds processes meet standard necessary
well system focuses improving customer experience broadest definition quality whatever customer perceives good quality means company doesnt necessarily make product never fails customers higher tolerance product failures always receive shipments ontime positive experience dimension customer service system take account areas customer experience industry expectations seek improve continual basis means taking account processes deal three stakeholders customers suppliers organization company able sustain improvements customers experience
well auditor finds communicates areas improvement auditors provide consulting clients audit potential auditors point areas improvement many auditors simply rely submitting reports indicate compliance noncompliance appropriate section standard however executives like speaking foreign language auditors clearly identify communicate areas improvement language terms executive management understands facilitate action improvement initiatives companies audit management doesnt understand noncompliant business implications associated noncompliance simply ignore reports focus understand

criticisms 9000edit
common criticism 9000 9001 amount money time paperwork required registration7 dalgleish cites inordinate often unnecessary paperwork burden says quality managers feel isos overhead paperwork excessive extremely inefficient44
according barnes opponents claim documentation proponents believe company documented quality systems paperwork already completed42 wilson suggests standards elevate inspection correct procedures broader aspects quality therefore workplace becomes oppressive quality improved8
study showing reasons adopting standard include risks uncertainty knowing direct relationships improved quality kind many resources needed additional risks include much certification cost increased bureaucratic processes risk poor company image certification process fails40 according john seddon 9001 promotes specification control procedures rather understanding improvement9 wade argues 9000 effective guideline promoting standard helps mislead companies thinking certification means better quality undermining need organization quality standards41 short wade argues reliance specifications 9001 guarantee successful quality system
standard seen especially prone failure company interested certification quality9 certifications fact often based customer contractual requirements rather desire actually improve quality4245 want certificate wall chances create paper system doesnt much actually business said isos roger frost45 certification independent auditor often seen problem area according barnes become vehicle increase consulting services42
dalgleish argues quality positive effect return investment market share sales growth better sales margins competitive advantage taking quality approach unrelated 9000 registration46 fact advises 9001 implemented without certification simply quality benefits achieved47
abrahamson argues fashionable management discourse quality circles tends follow lifecycle form bell curve possibly indicating management fad48
pickrell arguescitation needed systems merely gauge whether processes followed gauge good processes whether correct parameters measured controlled ensure quality furthermore unique technical solutions involved creation part validate robustness technical solution part advanced quality planning unheard isocertified plant display poor quality performance poor process selection andor poor technical solutions
