grammar
main article grammar

grammatical categories
main article grammatical category
grammar described system categories rules determine categories combine form different aspects meaning73 languages differ widely whether encoded categories lexical units however several categories common nearly universal universal categories include encoding grammatical relations participants predicates grammatically distinguishing relations predicate encoding temporal spatial relations predicates system grammatical person governing reference distinction speakers addressees speaking74
word classes
languages organize parts speech classes according functions positions relative parts languages instance make basic distinction group words prototypically denotes things concepts group words prototypically denotes actions events first group includes english words song usually called nouns second includes sing called verbs another common category adjective words describe properties qualities nouns word classes open words continuously added class relatively closed fixed number words class english class pronouns closed whereas class adjectives open since infinite number adjectives constructed verbs saddened nouns like suffix nounlike languages korean situation opposite pronouns constructed whereas number adjectives fixed75
word classes also carry differing functions grammar prototypically verbs used construct predicates nouns used arguments predicates sentence sally runs predicate runs word predicates specific state argument sally verbs curse take arguments sally cursed john predicate take single argument called intransitive predicate take arguments called transitive76
many word classes exist different languages conjunctions like serve join sentences articles introduce noun interjections ideophones like splash mimic sound event languages positionals describe spatial position event entity many languages classifiers identify countable nouns belonging particular type particular shape instance japanese general noun classifier humans used counting humans whatever called77

morphemes classified according whether independent morphemes socalled roots whether cooccur attached morphemes bound morphemes affixes classified according position relation root prefixes precede root suffixes follow root infixes inserted middle root affixes serve modify elaborate meaning root languages change meaning words changing phonological structure word example english word past tense process called ablaut furthermore morphology distinguishes process inflection modifies elaborates word process derivation creates word existing english verb sing inflectional forms singing sung verbs derivational form singer noun derived verb agentive suffix er79
languages differ widely much rely morphological processes word formation languages example chinese morphological processes grammatical information encoded syntactically forming strings single words type morphosyntax often called isolating analytic almost full correspondence single word single aspect meaning languages words consisting several morphemes vary degree morphemes discrete units many languages notably indoeuropean languages single morphemes several distinct meanings cannot analyzed smaller segments example latin word bonus good consists root meaning good suffix indicates masculine gender singular number nominative case languages called fusional languages several meanings fused single morpheme opposite fusional languages agglutinative languages construct words stringing morphemes together chains morpheme discrete semantic unit example language turkish example word evlerinizden houses consists morphemes evlerinizden meanings housepluralyourfrom languages rely morphology greatest extent traditionally called polysynthetic languages express equivalent entire english sentence single word example persian single word nafahmidamesh means didnt understand consisting morphemes nafahmidamesh meanings negationunderstandpastiit another example complexity yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq means said going hunt reindeer word consists morphemes tuntussurqatarniksaitengqiggteuq meanings reindeerhuntfuturesaynegationagainthirdpersonsingularindicative except morpheme tuntu reindeer none morphemes appear isolation80
many languages morphology crossreference words within sentence sometimes called agreement example many indoeuropean languages adjectives must crossreference noun modify terms number case gender latin adjective bonus good inflected agree noun masculine gender singular number nominative case many polysynthetic languages verbs crossreference subjects objects types languages single verb include information would require entire sentence english example basque phrase ikusi nauzu past tense auxiliary verb nauzu similar english agrees subject expressed prefix object expressed suffix sentence could directly transliterated youdidme81

languages change speakers adopt invent ways speaking pass members speech community language change happens levels phonological level levels vocabulary morphology syntax discourse even though language change often initially evaluated negatively speakers language often consider changes decay sign slipping norms language usage natural inevitable109
changes affect specific sounds entire phonological system sound change consist replacement speech sound phonetic feature another complete loss affected sound even introduction sound place none sound changes conditioned case sound changed occurs vicinity certain sounds sound change usually assumed regular means expected apply mechanically whenever structural conditions irrespective nonphonological factors hand sound changes sometimes sporadic affecting particular word words without seeming regularity sometimes simple change triggers chain shift entire phonological system affected happened germanic languages sound change known grimms affected stop consonants system original consonant became germanic languages previous turn became previous became process applied stop consonants explains italic languages latin words like pater pisces whereas germanic languages like english father fish110
another example great vowel shift english reason spelling english vowels correspond well current pronunciation vowel shift brought already established orthography synchronization pronunciation another source sound change erosion words pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct shortens words leaving syllables sounds kind change caused latin domina eventually become french madame american english maam111
change also happens grammar languages discourse patterns idioms particular constructions become grammaticalized frequently happens words morphemes erode grammatical system unconsciously rearranged compensate lost element example varieties caribbean spanish final eroded away since standard spanish uses final morpheme marking second person subject verbs caribbean varieties express second person using pronoun means sentence whats name ¿como llamas ˈkomo ˈjamas standard spanish ˈkomo ˈjama caribbean spanish simple sound change affected morphology syntax112 another common cause grammatical change gradual petrification idioms grammatical forms example english going construction lost aspect movement varieties english almost become fullfledged future tense gonna
language change motivated language internal factors changes pronunciation motivated certain sounds difficult distinguish aurally produce patterns change cause rare types constructions drift towards common types113 causes language change social certain pronunciations become emblematic membership certain groups social classes ideologies therefore adopted wish identify groups ideas issues identity politics profound effects language structure114
