features human circadian 24hour biological clock


circadian rhythm sɜːrˈkeɪdiən biological process displays endogenous entrainable oscillation hours 24hour rhythms driven circadian clock widely observed plants animals fungi cyanobacteria1
term circadian comes latin circa meaning around approximately diēm meaning formal study biological temporal rhythms daily tidal weekly seasonal annual rhythms called chronobiology processes 24hour oscillations generally called diurnal rhythms strictly speaking called circadian rhythms unless endogenous nature confirmed2
although circadian rhythms endogenous builtin selfsustained adjusted entrained local environment external cues called zeitgebers german time giver include light temperature redox cycles medical science abnormal circadian rhythm humans known circadian rhythm disorder3

criteriaedit
called circadian biological rhythm must meet three general criteria17

rhythm endogenous freerunning period lasts approximately hours rhythm persists constant conditions constant darkness period hours period rhythm constant conditions called freerunning period denoted greek letter rationale criterion distinguish circadian rhythms simple responses daily external cues rhythm cannot said endogenous unless tested persists conditions without external periodic input diurnal animals active daylight hours general slightly greater hours whereas nocturnal animals active night general shorter hours
rhythms entrainable rhythm reset exposure external stimuli light heat process called entrainment external stimulus used entrain rhythm called zeitgeber time giver travel across time zones illustrates ability human biological clock adjust local time person usually experience entrainment circadian clock brought sync local time
rhythms exhibit temperature compensation words maintain circadian periodicity range physiological temperatures many organisms live broad range temperatures differences thermal energy affect kinetics molecular processes cells order keep track time organisms circadian clock must maintain roughly 24hour periodicity despite changing kinetics property known temperature compensation temperature coefficient measure compensating effect coefficient remains approximately temperature increases rhythm considered temperaturecompensated
