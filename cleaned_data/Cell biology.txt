techniques used study cellsedit
also green fluorescent protein fluorescence microscope




electron micrograph blood cells clotting






cell division studied using fluorescence stain specific structures


cells observed microscope using several different techniques include optical microscopy transmission electron microscopy scanning electron microscopy fluorescence microscopy correlative lightelectron microscopy confocal microscopy
several different methods used study cells

cell culture basic technique growing cells laboratory independent organism
immunostaining also known immunohistochemistry specialized histological method used localize proteins cells tissue slices unlike regular histology uses stains identify cells cellular components protein classes immunostaining requires reaction antibody directed protein interest within tissue cell proper controls published protocols need reference links specificity antibodyantigen reaction achieved complex formed identified either attached directly antibody added additional technical step commonly used tags include fluorophores enzymes case former detection location immunostained protein occurs fluorescence microscopy enzymatic horse radish peroxidase chemical reaction carried results dark color location protein interest darkened pattern detected using light microscopy
computational genomics used find patterns genomic information5
microarrays identify changes transcript levels different experimental conditions
gene knockdown mutates selected gene
situ hybridization shows cells expressing particular transcript
used determine many copies gene present cell
transfection introduces gene cell usually expression construct
