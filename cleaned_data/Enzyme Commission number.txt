strictly speaking numbers specify enzymes enzymecatalyzed reactions different enzymes instance different organisms catalyze reaction receive number2 furthermore convergent evolution completely different protein folds catalyze identical reaction therefore would assigned identical number called nonhomologous isofunctional enzymes nise3 contrast uniprot identifiers uniquely specify protein amino acid sequence4
