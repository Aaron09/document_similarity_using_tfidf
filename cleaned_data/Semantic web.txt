backgroundedit
concept semantic network model formed early 1960s cognitive scientist allan collins linguist ross quillian psychologist elizabeth loftus form represent semantically structured knowledge applied context modern internet extends network hyperlinked humanreadable pages inserting machinereadable metadata pages related enables automated agents access intelligently perform tasks behalf users term semantic coined bernerslee3 inventor world wide director world wide consortium oversees development proposed semantic standards defines semantic data processed directly indirectly machines
many technologies proposed already existed positioned umbrella used various contexts particularly dealing information encompasses limited defined domain sharing data common necessity scientific research data exchange among businesses addition technologies similar goals emerged microformats
bernerslee originally expressed vision semantic follows

dream computers become capable analyzing data content links transactions people computers semantic makes possible emerge daytoday mechanisms trade bureaucracy daily lives handled machines talking machines intelligent agents people touted ages finally materialize8

semantic regarded integrator across different content information applications systems applications publishing blogging many areas
limitations htmledit
many files typical computer also loosely divided human readable documents machine readable data documents like mail messages reports brochures read humans data calendars addressbooks playlists spreadsheets presented using application program lets viewed searched combined
currently world wide based mainly documents written hypertext markup language html markup convention used coding body text interspersed multimedia objects images interactive forms metadata tags provide method computers categorise content pages example


meta namekeywords contentcomputing computer studies computer
meta namedescription contentcheap widgets sale
meta nameauthor contentjohn

html tool render perhaps browser software perhaps another user agent create present page lists items sale html catalog page make simple documentlevel assertions documents title widget superstore capability within html assert unambiguously example item number x586172 acme gizmo retail price €199 consumer product rather html span text x586172 something positioned near acme gizmo €199 catalog even establish acme gizmo kind title €199 price also express pieces information bound together describing discrete item distinct items perhaps listed page
semantic html refers traditional html practice markup following intention rather specifying layout details directly example denoting emphasis rather specifies italics layout details left browser combination cascading style sheets practice falls short specifying semantics objects items sale prices
microformats extend html syntax create machinereadable semantic markup objects including people organisations events products9 similar initiatives include rdfa microdata schemaorg
semantic solutionsedit
semantic takes solution involves publishing languages specifically designed data resource description framework ontology language extensible markup language html describes documents links contrast describe arbitrary things people meetings airplane parts
technologies combined order provide descriptions supplement replace content documents thus content manifest descriptive data stored webaccessible databases10 markup within documents particularly extensible html xhtml interspersed often purely layout rendering cues stored separately machinereadable descriptions enable content managers meaning content describe structure knowledge content machine process knowledge instead text using processes similar human deductive reasoning inference thereby obtaining meaningful results helping computers perform automated information gathering research
example would used nonsemantic page


itemblogitem

encoding similar information semantic page might look like


item rdfabouthttpexampleorgsemanticwebsemantic webitem

bernerslee calls resulting network linked data giant global graph contrast htmlbased world wide bernerslee posits past document sharing future data sharing answer question provides three points instruction point data anyone accessing data back three relationships data point additional urls data
30edit
bernerslee described semantic component 3011

people keep asking think maybe youve overlay scalable vector graphics everything rippling folding looking misty access semantic integrated across huge space data youll access unbelievable data resource
bernerslee 2006

semantic sometimes used synonym 3012 though definition term varies started emerge movement away centralisation services like search social media chat applications dependent single organisation function13
challengesedit
challenges semantic include vastness vagueness uncertainty inconsistency deceit automated reasoning systems deal issues order deliver promise semantic

vastness world wide contains many billions pages snomed medical terminology ontology alone contains 370000 class names existing technology able eliminate semantically duplicated terms automated reasoning system deal truly huge inputs
vagueness imprecise concepts like young tall arises vagueness user queries concepts represented content providers matching query terms provider terms trying combine different knowledge bases overlapping subtly different concepts fuzzy logic common technique dealing vagueness
uncertainty precise concepts uncertain values example patient might present symptoms correspond number different distinct diagnoses different probability probabilistic reasoning techniques generally employed address uncertainty
inconsistency logical contradictions inevitably arise development large ontologies ontologies separate sources combined deductive reasoning fails catastrophically faced inconsistency anything follows contradiction defeasible reasoning paraconsistent reasoning techniques employed deal inconsistency
deceit producer information intentionally misleading consumer information cryptography techniques currently utilized alleviate threat providing means determine informations integrity including relates identity entity produced published information however credibility issues still addressed cases potential deceit

list challenges illustrative rather exhaustive focuses challenges unifying logic proof layers semantic world wide consortium incubator group uncertainty reasoning world wide urw3xg final report lumps problems together single heading uncertainty many techniques mentioned require extensions ontology language example annotate conditional probabilities area active research14

semantic stack


semantic stack illustrates architecture semantic functions relationships components summarized follows16

provides elemental syntax content structure within documents associates semantics meaning content contained within present necessary component semantic technologies cases alternative syntaxes exists turtle turtle facto standard formal standardization process
schema language providing restricting structure content elements contained within documents
simple language expressing data models refer objects resources relationships rdfbased model represented variety syntaxes rdfxml turtle rdfa fundamental standard semantic web1718
schema extends vocabulary describing properties classes rdfbased resources semantics generalizedhierarchies properties classes
adds vocabulary describing properties classes among others relations classes disjointness cardinality exactly equality richer typing properties characteristics properties symmetry enumerated classes
sparql protocol query language semantic data sources
rule interchange format language expressing rules computers execute provides multiple versions called dialects includes basic logic dialect rifbld production rules dialect

applicationsedit
intent enhance usability usefulness interconnected resources creating semantic services

servers expose existing data systems using sparql standards many converters exist different applications relational databases important source semantic server attaches existing system without affecting operation
documents marked semantic information extension html meta tags used todays pages supply information search engines using crawlers could machineunderstandable information humanunderstandable content document creator title description could purely metadata representing facts resources services elsewhere site note anything identified uniform resource identifier described semantic reason animals people places ideas four semantic annotation formats used html documents microformat rdfa microdata jsonld19 semantic markup often generated automatically rather manually
common metadata vocabularies ontologies maps vocabularies allow document creators know mark documents agents information supplied metadata author sense author page wont confused author sense book subject book review
automated agents perform tasks users semantic using data
webbased services often agents supply information specifically agents example trust service agent could online store history poor service spamming

services could useful public search engines could used knowledge management within organization business applications include

facilitating integration information mixed sources
dissolving ambiguities corporate terminology
improving information retrieval thereby reducing information overload increasing refinement precision data retrieved20212223
identifying relevant information respect given domain24
providing decision making support

corporation closed group users management able enforce company guidelines like adoption specific ontologies semantic annotation compared public semantic lesser requirements scalability information circulating within company trusted general privacy less issue outside handling customer data
skeptical reactionsedit
practical feasibilityedit
critics question basic feasibility complete even partial fulfillment semantic pointing difficulties setting lack generalpurpose usefulness prevents required effort invested 2003 paper marshall shipman point cognitive overhead inherent formalizing knowledge compared authoring traditional hypertext25

learning basics html relatively straightforward learning knowledge representation language tool requires author learn representations methods abstraction effect reasoning example understanding classinstance relationship superclasssubclass relationship understanding concept “type another concept abstractions taught computer scientists generally knowledge engineers specifically match similar natural language meaning type something effective formal representation requires author become skilled knowledge engineer addition skills required domain learned formal representation language still often much effort express ideas representation less formal representation indeed form programming based declaration semantic data requires understanding reasoning algorithms interpret authored structures

according marshall shipman tacit changing nature much knowledge adds knowledge engineering problem limits semantic webs applicability specific domains issue point domain organisationspecific ways express knowledge must solved community agreement rather technical means25 turns specialized communities organizations intracompany projects tended adopt semantic technologies greater peripheral lessspecialized communities26 practical constraints toward adoption appeared less challenging domain scope limited general public worldwide web26
finally marshall shipman pragmatic problems idea knowledge navigatorstyle intelligent agents working largely manually curated semantic web25

situations user needs known distributed information resources well described approach highly effective situations foreseen bring together unanticipated array information resources google approach robust furthermore semantic relies inference chains brittle missing element chain results failure perform desired action human supply missing pieces googlelike approach costbenefit tradeoffs work favor speciallycreated semantic metadata directed weaving together sensible wellstructured domainspecific information resources close attention usercustomer needs drive federations successful

cory doctorows critique metacrap perspective human behavior personal preferences example people include spurious metadata pages attempt mislead semantic engines naively assume metadatas veracity phenomenon wellknown metatags fooled altavista ranking algorithm elevating ranking certain pages google indexing engine specifically looks attempts manipulation peter gärdenfors timo honkela point logicbased semantic technologies cover fraction relevant phenomena related semantics2728
censorship privacyedit
enthusiasm semantic could tempered concerns regarding censorship privacy instance textanalyzing techniques easily bypassed using words metaphors instance using images place words advanced implementation semantic would make much easier governments control viewing creation online information information would much easier automated contentblocking machine understand addition issue also raised foaf files geolocation metadata would little anonymity associated authorship articles things personal blog concerns addressed policy aware project29 active research development topic
doubling output formatsedit
another criticism semantic would much timeconsuming create publish content would need formats piece data human viewing machines however many applications development addressing issue creating machinereadable format upon publishing data request machine data development microformats reaction kind criticism another argument defense feasibility semantic likely falling price human intelligence tasks digital labor markets amazons mechanical turkcitation needed
specifications erdf rdfa allow arbitrary data embedded html pages grddl gleaning resource descriptions dialects language mechanism allows existing material including microformats automatically interpreted publishers need single format html
research activities corporate applicationsedit
first research group explicitly focusing corporate semantic acacia team inriasophiaantipolis founded 2002 results work include rdfs based corese search engine application semantic technology realm elearning30
since 2008 corporate semantic research group located free university berlin focuses building blocks corporate semantic search corporate semantic collaboration corporate ontology engineering31
