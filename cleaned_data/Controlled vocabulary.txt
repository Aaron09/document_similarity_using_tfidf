library information scienceedit
library information science controlled vocabulary carefully selected list words phrases used units information document work easily retrieved search34 controlled vocabularies solve problems homographs synonyms polysemes bijection concepts authorized terms short controlled vocabularies reduce ambiguity inherent normal human languages concept given different names ensure consistency
example library congress subject headings subject heading system uses controlled vocabulary authorized terms—subject headings case—have chosen handle choices variant spellings word american versus british choice among scientific popular terms cockroach versus periplaneta americana choices synonyms automobile versus among difficult issues
choices authorized terms based principles user warrant terms users likely literary warrant terms generally used literature documents structural warrant terms chosen considering structure scope controlled vocabulary
controlled vocabularies also typically handle problem homographs qualifiers example term pool qualified refer either swimming pool game pool ensure authorized term heading refers concept
main kinds controlled vocabulary tools used libraries subject headings thesauri differences diminishing still minor differences
historically subject headings designed describe books library catalogs catalogers thesauri used indexers apply index terms documents articles subject headings tend broader scope describing whole books thesauri tend specialized covering specific disciplines also card catalog system subject headings tend terms indirect order though rise automated systems removed thesaurus terms always direct order subject headings also tend precoordination terms designer controlled vocabulary combine various concepts together form authorized subject heading children terrorism thesauri tend singular direct terms lastly thesauri list equivalent terms also narrower broader terms related terms among various authorized nonauthorized terms historically subject headings
example library congress subject heading much syndetic structure 1943 1985 began adopt thesauri type term broader term narrow term
terms chosen organized trained professionals including librarians information scientists possess expertise subject area controlled vocabulary terms accurately describe given document actually even terms occur within documents text well known subject heading systems include library congress system mesh sears well known thesauri include architecture thesaurus eric thesaurus
choosing authorized terms used tricky business besides areas already considered designer consider specificity term chosen whether direct entry inter consistency stability language lastly amount precoordinate case degree enumeration versus synthesis becomes issue post coordinate system another important issue

indexing languagesedit
three main types indexing languages

controlled indexing language approved terms used indexer describe document
natural language indexing language term document question used describe document
free indexing language term document used describe document

indexing document indexer also choose level indexing exhaustivity level detail document described example using indexing exhaustivity minor aspects work described index terms general higher indexing exhaustivity terms indexed document
recent years free text search means access documents become popular involves using natural language indexing indexing exhaustively maximum every word text indexed many studies done compare efficiency effectiveness free text searches documents indexed experts using well chosen controlled vocabulary descriptors
controlled vocabularies often claimed improve accuracy free text searching reduce irrelevant items retrieval list irrelevant items false positives often caused inherent ambiguity natural language take english word football example football name given number different team sports worldwide popular team sports association football also happens called soccer several countries word football also applied rugby football rugby union rugby league american football australian rules football gaelic football canadian football search football therefore retrieve documents several completely different sports controlled vocabulary solves problem tagging documents ambiguities eliminated
compared free text searching controlled vocabulary dramatically increase performance information retrieval system performance measured precision percentage documents retrieval list actually relevant search topic
cases controlled vocabulary enhance recall well unlike natural language schemes correct authorized term searched need search terms might synonyms term
however controlled vocabulary search also lead unsatisfactory recall fail retrieve documents actually relevant search question
particularly problematic search question involves terms sufficiently tangential subject area indexer might decided using different term searcher might consider essentially avoided experienced user controlled vocabulary whose understanding vocabulary coincides indexer
another possibility article tagged indexer indexing exhaustivity example article might mention football secondary focus indexer might decide football important enough compared main focus turns searcher article relevant hence recall fails free text search would automatically pick article regardless
hand free text searches high exhaustivity every word searched although much lower precision potential high recall long searcher overcome problem synonyms entering every combination
controlled vocabularies become outdated rapidly fast developing fields knowledge unless authorized terms updated regularly even ideal scenario controlled vocabulary often less specific words text indexers trying choose appropriate index terms might misinterpret author precise problem factor free text uses authors words
controlled vocabularies costly compared free text searches human experts expensive automated systems necessary index entry furthermore user familiar controlled vocabulary scheme make best system already mentioned control synonyms homographs help increase precision
numerous methodologies developed assist creation controlled vocabularies including faceted classification enables given data record document described multiple ways

controlled vocabularies library congress subject headings essential component bibliography study classification books initially developed library information science 1950s government agencies began develop controlled vocabularies burgeoning journal literature specialized fields example medical subject headings mesh developed national library medicine subsequently forprofit firms called abstracting indexing services emerged index fastgrowing literature every field knowledge 1960s online bibliographic database industry developed based dialup networking services seldom made available public difficult specialist librarians called search intermediaries handled searching 1980s first full text databases appeared databases contain full text index articles well bibliographic information online bibliographic databases migrated internet publicly available however proprietary expensive students enrolled colleges universities able access services without charge services accessible without charge public library
large organizations controlled vocabularies introduced improve technical communication controlled vocabulary ensures everyone using word mean thing consistency terms important concepts technical writing knowledge management effort expended word throughout document organization instead slightly different ones refer thing
searching could dramatically improved development controlled vocabulary describing pages vocabulary could culminate semantic content pages described using machinereadable metadata scheme first proposals scheme dublin core initiative example controlled vocabulary usable indexing pages
