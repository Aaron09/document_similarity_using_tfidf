noun term alloy used describe mixture atoms primary constituent metal used verb term refers mixing metal elements primary metal called base matrix solvent secondary constituents often called solutes mixture types atoms counting impurities coppernickel alloy called binary alloy three types atoms forming mixture iron nickel chromium called ternary alloy alloy four constituents quaternary alloy fivepart alloy termed quinary alloy percentage constituent varied mixture entire range possible variations called system respect various forms alloy containing constituents like iron carbon called binary system alloy combinations possible ternary alloy alloys iron carbon chromium called ternary system2
although alloy technically impure metal referring alloys term impurities usually denotes elements desired impurities introduced base metals alloying elements removed processing instance sulfur common impurity steel sulfur combines readily iron form iron sulfide brittle creating weak spots steel3 lithium sodium calcium common impurities aluminium alloys adverse effects structural integrity castings conversely otherwise puremetals simply contain unwanted impurities often called impure metals usually referred alloys oxygen present readily combines metals form metal oxides especially higher temperatures encountered alloying great care often taken alloying process remove excess impurities using fluxes chemical additives methods extractive metallurgy4
practice alloys used predominantly respect base metals name primary constituent also used name alloy example karat gold alloy gold elements similarly silver used jewelry aluminium used structural building material also alloys
term alloy sometimes used everyday speech synonym particular alloy example automobile wheels made aluminium alloy commonly referred simply alloy wheels although point fact steels metals practical also alloys steel common alloy many items made like wheels barrels girders simply referred name item assuming made steel made materials typically specified bronze wheel plastic barrel wood girder

although steel alloy iron carbon term alloy steel usually refers steels contain elements like vanadium molybdenum cobalt amounts sufficient alter properties base steel since ancient times steel used primarily tools weapons methods producing working metal often closely guarded secrets even long reason steel industry competitive manufacturers went though great lengths keep processes confidential resisting attempts scientifically analyze material fear would reveal methods example people sheffield center steel production england known routinely visitors tourists entering town deter industrial espionage thus almost metallurgical information existed steel 1860 lack understanding steel generally considered alloy decades 1930 1970 primarily work scientists like william chandler robertsausten adolph martens edgar bain alloy steel became popular term ternary quaternary steelalloys2223
