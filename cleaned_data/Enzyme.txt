structure




enzyme activity initially increases temperature coefficient enzymes structure unfolds denaturation leading optimal rate reaction intermediate temperature


also protein structure
enzymes generally globular proteins acting alone larger complexes sequence amino acids specifies structure turn determines catalytic activity enzyme22 although structure determines function novel enzymatic activity cannot predicted structure alone23 enzyme structures unfold denature heated exposed chemical denaturants disruption structure typically causes loss activity24 enzyme denaturation normally linked temperatures species normal level result enzymes bacteria living volcanic environments springs prized industrial users ability function high temperatures allowing enzymecatalysed reactions operated high rate
enzymes usually much larger substrates sizes range amino acid residues monomer 4oxalocrotonate tautomerase25 2500 residues animal fatty acid synthase26 small portion structure around amino acids directly involved catalysis catalytic site27 catalytic site located next binding sites residues orient substrates catalytic site binding site together comprise enzymes active site remaining majority enzyme structure serves maintain precise orientation dynamics active site28
enzymes amino acids directly involved catalysis instead enzyme contains sites bind orient catalytic cofactors28 enzyme structures also contain allosteric sites binding small molecule causes conformational change increases decreases activity29
small number rnabased biological catalysts called ribozymes exist alone complex proteins common ribosome complex protein catalytic components122
mechanism




organisation enzyme structure lysozyme example binding sites blue catalytic site peptidoglycan substrate black 9lyz​


substrate binding
enzymes must bind substrates catalyse chemical reaction enzymes usually specific substrates bind chemical reaction catalysed specificity achieved binding pockets complementary shape charge hydrophilichydrophobic characteristics substrates enzymes therefore distinguish similar substrate molecules chemoselective regioselective stereospecific30
enzymes showing highest specificity accuracy involved copying expression genome enzymes proofreading mechanisms enzyme polymerase catalyzes reaction first step checks product correct second step31 twostep process results average error rates less error million reactions highfidelity mammalian polymerases1531 similar proofreading mechanisms also found polymerase32 aminoacyl trna synthetases33 ribosomes34
conversely enzymes display enzyme promiscuity broad specificity acting range different physiologically relevant substrates many enzymes possess small side activities arose fortuitously neutrally starting point evolutionary selection function3536

lock model
explain observed specificity enzymes 1894 emil fischer proposed enzyme substrate possess specific complementary geometric shapes exactly another37 often referred lock model1832 early model explains enzyme specificity fails explain stabilization transition state enzymes achieve38
induced model
1958 daniel koshland suggested modification lock model since enzymes rather flexible structures active site continuously reshaped interactions substrate substrate interacts enzyme39 result substrate simply bind rigid active site amino acid sidechains make active site molded precise positions enable enzyme perform catalytic function cases glycosidases substrate molecule also changes shape slightly enters active site40 active site continues change substrate completely bound point final shape charge distribution determined41 induced enhance fidelity molecular recognition presence competition noise conformational proofreading mechanism42
catalysis
also enzyme catalysis
enzymes accelerate reactions several ways lower activation energy gibbs free energy43

stabilizing transition state

creating environment charge distribution complementary transition state lower energy44


providing alternative reaction pathway

temporarily reacting substrate forming covalent intermediate provide lower energy transition state45


destabilising substrate ground state

distorting bound substrates transition state form reduce energy required reach transition state46
orienting substrates productive arrangement reduce reaction entropy change47 contribution mechanism catalysis relatively small48



enzymes several mechanisms simultaneously example proteases trypsin perform covalent catalysis using catalytic triad stabilise charge buildup transition states using oxyanion hole complete hydrolysis using oriented water substrate

allosteric modulation
main article allosteric regulation
allosteric sites pockets enzyme distinct active site bind molecules cellular environment molecules cause change conformation dynamics enzyme transduced active site thus affects reaction rate enzyme50 allosteric interactions either inhibit activate enzymes allosteric interactions metabolites upstream downstream enzymes metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation altering activity enzyme according flux rest pathway51
cofactors

main article cofactor biochemistry
enzymes need additional components show full activity others require nonprotein molecules called cofactors bound activity52 cofactors either inorganic metal ions ironsulfur clusters organic compounds flavin heme cofactors serve many purposes instance metal ions help stabilizing nucleophilic species within active site53 organic cofactors either coenzymes released enzymes active site reaction prosthetic groups tightly bound enzyme organic prosthetic groups covalently bound biotin enzymes pyruvate carboxylase54
example enzyme contains cofactor carbonic anhydrase shown ribbon diagram zinc cofactor bound part active site55 tightly bound ions molecules usually found active site involved catalysis1811 example flavin heme cofactors often involved redox reactions117
enzymes require cofactor bound called apoenzymes apoproteins enzyme together cofactors required activity called holoenzyme haloenzyme term holoenzyme also applied enzymes contain multiple protein subunits polymerases holoenzyme complete complex containing subunits needed activity1811
coenzymes
coenzymes small organic molecules loosely tightly bound enzyme coenzymes transport chemical groups enzyme another56 examples include nadh nadph adenosine triphosphate coenzymes flavin mononucleotide flavin adenine dinucleotide thiamine pyrophosphate tetrahydrofolate derived vitamins coenzymes cannot synthesized body novo closely related compounds vitamins must acquired diet chemical groups carried include hydride carried nadp phosphate group carried adenosine triphosphate acetyl group carried coenzyme formyl methenyl methyl groups carried folic acid methyl group carried sadenosylmethionine56
since coenzymes chemically changed consequence enzyme action useful consider coenzymes special class substrates second substrates common many different enzymes example 1000 enzymes known coenzyme nadh57
coenzymes usually continuously regenerated concentrations maintained steady level inside cell example nadph regenerated pentose phosphate pathway sadenosylmethionine methionine adenosyltransferase continuous regeneration means small amounts coenzymes used intensively example human body turns weight day58

enzyme rates depend solution conditions substrate concentration find maximum speed enzymatic reaction substrate concentration increased constant rate product formation seen shown saturation curve right saturation happens substrate concentration increases free enzyme converted substratebound complex maximum reaction rate vmax enzyme enzyme active sites bound substrate amount complex total amount enzyme184
vmax several important kinetic parameters amount substrate needed achieve given rate reaction also important given michaelismenten constant substrate concentration required enzyme reach onehalf maximum reaction rate generally enzyme characteristic given substrate another useful constant kcat also called turnover number number substrate molecules handled active site second184
