american revolution caused great divide amongst colonists patriots loyalists caused divide colonies great britain also caused rift would break iroquois confederacy onset revolution iroquois confederacys nations attempted take stance neutrality however almost inevitably iroquois nations eventually take sides conflict easy american revolution would caused conflict confusion among nations years used thinking english colonists people american revolution iroquois confederacy deal relationships governments100
iroquois confederations population changed significantly since arrival europeans disease reduced population fraction past101 therefore best interest good side whoever would prove winning side winning side would dictate future relationships would iroquois north america dealing governments made hard maintain neutral stance governments could jealous easily confederacy interacting trading side even simply perception favoritism challenging situation nations choose sides oneida tuscarora decided support american colonists rest iroquois league cayuga mohawk onondaga seneca sided british loyalists among colonists
many reasons nations could remain neutral uninvolved revolutionary simple proximity iroquois confederacy close action involved nations discontented encroachment english colonists upon land particularly concerned border established proclamation 1763 treaty fort stanwix 1768102
american revolution authority british government frontier highly contested colonists tried take advantage much possible seeking profit claiming land 1775 nations still neutral mohawk person killed continental soldier101370 case shows nations proximity drew concerned killed lands taken could show weakness simply colonists british whatever wanted many english colonists respect treaties made past number majestys subjects american colonies viewed proclamation temporary prohibition would soon give opening area settlement simply agreement quiet minds indians102 nations take stand show would accept treatment looked build relationship government would respect territory
addition close proximity lifestyle economics iroquois confederacy since arrival europeans north america made nearly impossible iroquois isolate conflict time iroquois become dependent upon trade goods english colonists adopted many european customs tools weapons example increasingly dependent firearms hunting103 becoming reliant would hard even consider cutting trade brought goods central part everyday life
barbara graymont stated task impossible maintain neutrality economies lives become dependent trading goods benefits impossible ignore conflict meanwhile balance interactions groups want seem favoring group sparking jealousy suspicion either side furthermore english made many agreements nations years iroquois daytoday interaction colonists made confusing situation iroquois could tell true heirs agreement couldnt know agreements england would continue honored colonists independence
supporting either side revolutionary complicated decision nation individually weighed options come final stance ultimately broke neutrality ended collective agreement confederation british clearly organized seemingly powerful many cases british presented situation iroquois colonists naughty children iroquois considered british government three thousand miles away placed disadvantage attempting enforce proclamation 1763 treaty fort stanwix 1768 land hungry frontiersmen10349 words even though british strongest best organized faction nations concerns whether would truly able enforce agreements away

contrasting note colonists formed direct relationships iroquois proximity trade ties part colonists iroquois lived relative peace since english arrival continent century half iroquois determine whether relationships colonists reliable whether english would prove better serve interests also determine whether really differences english colonists would treat
