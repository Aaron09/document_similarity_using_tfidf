homogeneous means components mixture form single phase heterogeneous means components mixture different phase properties mixture concentration temperature density uniformly distributed volume absence diffusion phenomena completion usually substance present greatest amount considered solvent solvents gases liquids solids components present solution solvent called solutes solution physical state solvent
gaseous solutionsedit
solvent gases dissolved given conditions example gaseous solution oxygen gases dissolved nitrogen since interactions molecules play almost role dilute gases form rather trivial solutions part literature even classified solutions addressed mixtures
liquid solutionsedit
solvent liquid almost gases liquids solids dissolved examples

liquid

oxygen water
carbon dioxide water less simple example solution accompanied chemical reaction formation ions note also visible bubbles carbonated water dissolved effervescence carbon dioxide come solution dissolved visible since dissolved molecular level


liquid liquid

mixing substances chemistry different concentrations form constant homogenization solutions
alcoholic beverages basically solutions ethanol water


solid liquid

sucrose table sugar water
sodium chloride nacl table salt salt water forms electrolyte dissolving salt dissociates ions


solutions water especially common

counter examples provided liquid mixtures homogeneous colloids suspensions emulsions considered solutions
body fluids examples complex liquid solutions containing many solutes many electrolytes since contain solute ions potassium furthermore contain solute molecules like sugar urea oxygen carbon dioxide also essential components blood chemistry significant changes concentrations sign severe illness injury
solid solutionsedit
solvent solid gases liquids solids dissolved

solids

hydrogen dissolves rather well metals especially palladium studied means hydrogen storage


liquid solid

mercury gold forming amalgam
water solid salt sugar forming moist solids
hexane paraffin


solid solid

steel basically solution carbon atoms crystalline matrix iron atoms
alloys like bronze many others
polymers containing plasticizers



solubilityedit
main articles solubility solvation
ability compound dissolve another compound called solubility liquid completely dissolve another liquid liquids miscible substances never form solution called immiscible
solutions positive entropy mixing interactions different molecules ions energetically favored interactions unfavorable free energy decreases increasing solute concentration point energy loss outweighs entropy gain solute particles dissolved solution said saturated however point solution become saturated change significantly different environmental factors temperature pressure contamination solutesolvent combinations supersaturated solution prepared raising solubility example increasing temperature dissolve solute lowering example cooling
usually greater temperature solvent given solid solute dissolve however gases compounds exhibit solubilities decrease increased temperature behavior result exothermic enthalpy solution surfactants exhibit behaviour solubility liquids liquids generally less temperaturesensitive solids gases
propertiesedit
physical properties compounds melting point boiling point change compounds added together called colligative properties several ways quantify amount compound dissolved compounds collectively called concentration examples include molarity volume fraction mole fraction
properties ideal solutions calculated linear combination properties components solute solvent exist equal quantities ethanol water solution concepts solute solvent become less relevant substance often used solvent normally designated solvent example water
liquidedit
also solvent solvent classifications
principle types liquids behave solvents liquid noble gases molten metals molten salts molten covalent networks molecular liquids practice chemistry biochemistry solvents molecular liquids classified polar nonpolar according whether molecules possess permanent electric dipole moment another distinction whether molecules form hydrogen bonds protic aprotic solvents water commonly used solvent polar sustains hydrogen bonds




water good solvent molecules polar capable forming hydrogen bonds


salts dissolve polar solvents forming positive negative ions attracted negative positive ends solvent molecule respectively solvent water hydration occurs charged solute ions become surrounded water molecules standard example aqueous saltwater solutions called electrolytes
polar solutes dissolve polar solvents forming polar bonds hydrogen bonds example alcoholic beverages aqueous solutions ethanol hand nonpolar solutes dissolve better nonpolar solvents examples hydrocarbons grease easily incompatible water
example immiscibility water leak petroleum damaged tanker dissolve ocean water rather floats surface
preparation constituent ingredientsedit
common practice laboratories make solution directly constituent ingredients three cases practical calculation

case amount solvent volume given
case amount solute mass given
case amount final solution volume given

following equations solvent solute concentration solute volume contribution considered ideal solution model

case amount solvent volume given solute mass 100cdb
case amount solute mass given solvent volume 100c1
case amount final solution volume given solute mass solvent volume va100c1
case solute mass known 100c
case total solution volume known equation case vavt

example make g100ml nacl solution water water properties density resulting solution considered equal water statement holding especially dilute solutions density information required
