barcode optical machinereadable representation data data usually describes something object carries barcode originally barcodes systematically represented data varying widths spacings parallel lines referred linear onedimensional later twodimensional codes developed using rectangles dots hexagons geometric patterns dimensions usually called barcodes although bars barcodes initially scanned special optical scanners called barcode readers later application software became available devices could read images smartphones cameras
early type barcode industrial context sponsored association american railroads late 1960s developed general telephone electronics called kartrak automatic identification scheme involved placing colored stripes various combinations steel plates affixed sides railroad rolling stock plates used side arrangement colored stripes encoding information ownership type equipment identification number1 plates read trackside scanner located instance entrance classification yard moving past2 project abandoned years system proved unreliable longterm use1
barcodes became commercially successful used automate supermarket checkout systems task become almost universal spread many tasks generically referred automatic identification data capture aidc first scanning ubiquitous universal product code barcode pack wrigley company chewing june 19743
systems made inroads aidc market simplicity universality cost barcodes limited role systems technologies radio frequency identification rfid became available 2000

1948 bernard silver graduate student drexel institute technology philadelphia pennsylvania overheard president local food chain food fair asking deans research system automatically read product information checkout4 silver told friend norman joseph woodland request started working variety systems first working system used ultraviolet faded easily expensive56
convinced system workable development woodland left drexel moved fathers apartment florida continued working system next inspiration came morse code formed first barcode sand beach extended dots dashes downwards made narrow lines wide lines them5 read adapted technology optical soundtracks movies using 500watt incandescent light bulb shining paper onto rca935 photomultiplier tube movie projector side later decided system would work better printed circle instead line allowing scanned direction
october 1949 woodland silver filed patent application classifying apparatus method described linear bullseye printing patterns well mechanical electronic systems needed read code patent issued october 1952 patent 2612994 1951 woodland moved continually tried interest developing system company eventually commissioned report idea concluded feasible interesting processing resulting information would require equipment time future

collins sylvaniaedit
time undergraduate david collins worked pennsylvania railroad became aware need automatically identify railroad cars immediately receiving masters degree 1959 started work sylvania began addressing problem developed system called kartrak using blue reflective stripes attached side cars encoding sixdigit company identifier fourdigit number5 light reflected stripes photomultipliers filtered blue redcitation needed
boston maine railroad tested kartrak system gravel cars 1961 tests continued 1967 association american railroads selected standard automatic identification across entire north american fleet installations began october 1967 however economic downturn rash bankruptcies industry early 1970s greatly slowed rollout 1974 fleet labeled woes system found easily fooled dirt certain applications greatly affected accuracy abandoned system late 1970s mid1980s introduced similar system time based radio tags7
railway project failed toll bridge jersey requested similar system could quickly scan cars purchased monthly pass post office requested system track trucks entering leaving facilities applications required special retroreflector labels finally asked sylvania team simpler cheaper version could cases food inventory control
computer identics corporationedit
1967 railway system maturing collins went management looking funding project develop blackandwhite version code industries declined saying railway project large enough need branch quickly
collins quit sylvania formed computer identics corporation5 first innovations computer identics moved using incandescent light bulbs systems replacing helium–neon lasers incorporated mirror well making capable locating barcode several feet front scanner made entire process much simpler reliable typically enabled devices deal damaged labels well recognizing reading intact portions
computer identics corporation installed first scanning systems spring 1969 general motors buick factory flint michigan5 system used identify dozen types transmissions moving overhead conveyor production shipping scanning system installed general trading companys distribution center carlstadt jersey direct shipments proper loading

symbologiesedit
mapping messages barcodes called symbology specification symbology includes encoding message bars spaces required start stop markers size quiet zone required barcode computation checksum
linear symbologies classified mainly properties

continuous discrete


characters discrete symbologies composed bars spaces additional space characters convey information width long confused code
characters continuous symbologies composed bars spaces usually abut character ending space next beginning vice versa special pattern bars ends required code


twowidth manywidth


twowidth also called binary code contains bars spaces widths wide narrow precise width wide bars spaces critical typically permitted anywhere times width narrow equivalents
symbologies bars different heights postnet presence absence bars binary barcode normally also considered binary codes
bars spaces manywidth symbologies multiples basic width called module codes four widths modules

symbologies interleaving first character encoded using black bars varying width second character encoded varying width white spaces bars thus characters encoded pairs section barcode interleaved example
stacked symbologies repeat given linear symbology vertically
common among many symbologies matrix codes feature square dotshaped modules arranged grid pattern symbologies also come circular patterns employ steganography hiding modules within image example dataglyphs
linear symbologies optimized laser scanners sweep light beam across barcode straight line reading slice barcode lightdark patterns scanning angle makes modules appear wider change width ratios stacked symbologies also optimized laser scanning laser making multiple passes across barcode
1990s development charge coupled device imagers read barcodes pioneered welch allyn imaging require moving parts laser scanner 2007 linear imaging begun supplant laser scanning preferred scan engine performance durability
symbologies cannot read laser typically sweep pattern encompass entire symbol must scanned imagebased scanner employing digital camera sensor technology

benefitsedit
pointofsale management barcode systems provide detailed uptodate information business accelerating decisions confidence example

fastselling items identified quickly automatically reordered
slowselling items identified preventing inventory buildup
effects merchandising changes monitored allowing fastmoving profitable items occupy best space
historical data used predict seasonal fluctuations accurately
items repriced shelf reflect sale prices price increases
technology also enables profiling individual consumers typically voluntary registration discount cards pitched benefit consumer practice considered potentially dangerous privacy advocates

besides sales inventory tracking barcodes useful logistics supply chain management

manufacturer packs shipment unique identifying number assigned
database link relevant information order number items packed quantity packed destination
information transmitted communication system electronic data interchange retailer information shipment arrives
shipments sent distribution center tracked forwarding shipment reaches final destination gets scanned store knows shipments source contents cost
