basic characteristics arachnids include four pairs legs body divided tagmata cephalothorax abdomen


almost adult arachnids eight legs arachnids easily distinguished insects fact since insects legs however arachnids also pairs appendages become adapted feeding defense sensory perception first pair chelicerae serve feeding defense next pair appendages pedipalps adapted feeding locomotion andor reproductive functions solifugae palps quite leglike animals appear legs larvae mites ricinulei legs fourth pair usually appears moult nymphs however mites variable well eight adult mites even four legs3
arachnids distinguished insects fact antennae wings body organized tagmata called prosoma cephalothorax opisthosoma abdomen cephalothorax derived fusion cephalon head thorax usually covered single unsegmented carapace abdomen segmented primitive forms varying degrees fusion segments occur many groups typically divided preabdomen postabdomen although clearly visible scorpions orders acari abdominal sections completely fused4 telson present scorpions modified stinger schizomida whip scorpions palpigradi5
like arthropods arachnids exoskeleton also internal structure cartilagelike tissue called endosternite certain muscle groups attached endosternite even calcified opiliones6
locomotionedit
arachnids lack extensor muscles distal joints appendages spiders whipscorpions extend limbs hydraulically using pressure hemolymph7 solifuges harvestmen extend knees highly elastic thickenings joint cuticle7 scorpions pseudoscorpions harvestmen evolved muscles extend joints femurpatella patellatibia joints once89 equivalent joints pedipalps scorpions though extended elastic recoil10

characteristics particularly important terrestrial lifestyle arachnids internal respiratory surfaces form tracheae modification book gill book lung internal series vascular lamellae used exchange air11 tracheae often individual systems tubes similar insects ricinuleids pseudoscorpions spiders possess sieve tracheae several tubes arise bundle small chamber connected spiracle type tracheal system almost certainly evolved book lungs indicates tracheae arachnids homologous insects12
adaptations terrestrial life appendages modified efficient locomotion land internal fertilisation special sensory organs water conservation enhanced efficient excretory structures well waxy layer covering cuticle
excretory glands arachnids include four pairs coxal glands along side prosoma pairs malpighian tubules emptying many arachnids type excretory gland although several primary nitrogenous waste product arachnids guanine12
arachnid blood variable composition depending mode respiration arachnids efficient tracheal system need transport oxygen blood reduced circulatory system scorpions spiders however blood contains haemocyanin copperbased pigment similar function haemoglobin vertebrates heart located forward part abdomen segmented mites heart all12
diet digestive systemedit
arachnids mostly carnivorous feeding predigested bodies insects small animals harvestmen among mites house dust mite ingestion solid food particles thus exposure internal parasites13 although unusual spiders silk several groups secrete venom specialized glands kill prey enemies several mites ticks parasites carriers disease
arachnids produce digestive juices stomachs pedipalps chelicerae pour dead prey digestive juices rapidly turn prey broth nutrients arachnid sucks prebuccal cavity located immediately front mouth behind mouth muscular sclerotised pharynx acts pump sucking food mouth oesophagus stomach arachnids oesophagus also acts additional pump
stomach tubular shape multiple diverticula extending throughout body stomach diverticula produce digestive enzymes absorb nutrients food extends body connects short sclerotised intestine anus hind part abdomen12
sensesedit
arachnids kinds eyes lateral median ocelli lateral ocelli evolved compound eyes tapetum enhances ability collect light exception scorpions five pairs lateral ocelli never three pairs present median ocelli develop transverse fold ectoderm ancestors modern arachnids probably types modern ones often lack type other13 cornea also acts lens continuous cuticle body beneath transparent vitreous body retina present tapetum arachnids retina probably enough light sensitive cells allow eyes form proper image12
addition eyes almost arachnids types sensory organs important arachnids fine sensory hairs cover body give animal sense touch relatively simple many arachnids also possess complex structures called trichobothria
finally slit sense organs slitlike pits covered thin membrane inside small hair touches underside membrane detects motion slit sense organs believed involved proprioception possibly also hearing12
reproductionedit
also spider reproduction life cycle scorpion reproduction
arachnids gonads located abdomen genital opening usually located underside second abdominal segment species male transfers sperm female package spermatophore complex courtship rituals evolved many arachnids ensure safe delivery sperm female12
arachnids usually yolky eggs hatch immatures resemble adults scorpions however either ovoviviparous viviparous depending species bear live young arachnids females provide parental care harvestmen exceptionscitation needed
