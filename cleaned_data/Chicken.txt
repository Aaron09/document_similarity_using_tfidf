chickens gregarious birds live together flocks communal approach incubation eggs raising young individual chickens flock dominate others establishing pecking order dominant individuals priority food access nesting locations removing hens roosters flock causes temporary disruption social order pecking order established adding hens especially younger birds existing flock lead fighting injury16 rooster finds food call chickens first clucking high pitch well picking dropping food behaviour also observed mother hens call chicks encourage
roosters crowing loud sometimes shrill call sends territorial signal roosterscitation needed however roosters also crow response sudden disturbances within surroundings hens cluck loudly laying also call chicks chickens also give warning call sense predator approachingcitation needed
courtship
initiate courting roosters dance circle around near circle dance often lowering wing closest hen17 dance triggers response hen17 responds call rooster mount proceed mating
specifically mating typically involves following sequence male approaching male precopulatory waltzing male waltzing female crouching receptive posture stepping aside running away unwilling copulate male mounting male treading feet hen’s back male tail bending following successful copulation18
nesting laying behaviour




chicken eggs vary colour depending typically ranging bright white shades brown even blue green recently reported purple found south asia araucana varieties






chicks first outing


hens often nests already contain eggs known move eggs neighbouring nests result behaviour flock preferred locations rather different nest every bird hens often express preference location unknown hens share nest time nest small hens particularly determined result chickens trying evidence individual hens prefer either solitary gregarious nesters19 farmers fake eggs made plastic stone golf balls encourage hens particular location
broodiness
natural conditions birds clutch complete incubate eggs many domestic hens also this–and said broody broody stop laying instead focus incubation eggs full clutch usually eggs nest protesting pecking defense disturbed removed rarely leave nest drink dustbathe brooding maintains nest constant temperature humidity well turning eggs regularly first part incubation stimulate broodiness owners place several artificial eggs nest discourage place elevated cage open wire floor

modern egglaying breeds rarely broody often stop partway incubation however utility general purpose breeds cochin cornish silkie regularly broody make excellent mothers chicken eggs also species—even much smaller larger eggs different incubation periods quail pheasants turkeys geese chicken eggs also hatched broody duck varied success
hatching early life
fertile chicken eggs hatch incubation period days17 development chick starts incubation begins chicks hatch within despite perhaps laid period weeks hatching hear chicks peeping inside eggs gently cluck stimulate break shells chick begins pipping pecking breathing hole tooth towards blunt usually upper side chick rests hours absorbing remaining yolk withdrawing blood supply membrane beneath shell used earlier breathing shell chick enlarges hole gradually turning round goes eventually severing blunt shell completely make chick crawls remaining shell dries warmth nest
hens usually remain nest days first chick hatches time newly hatched chicks feed absorbing internal yolk commercial breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs become habitual20 hens fiercely guard chicks brood necessary keep warm first often returning nest night leads food water call toward edible items seldom feeds directly continues care several weeks
