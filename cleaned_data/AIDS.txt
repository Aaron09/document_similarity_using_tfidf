acute infection




main symptoms acute infection


initial period following contraction called acute primary acute retroviral syndrome226 many individuals develop influenzalike illness mononucleosislike illness weeks post exposure others significant symptoms2728 symptoms occur 40–90 cases commonly include fever large tender lymph nodes throat inflammation rash headache andor sores mouth genitals2628 rash occurs 20–50 cases presents trunk maculopapular classically29 people also develop opportunistic infections stage26 gastrointestinal symptoms vomiting diarrhea occur28 neurological symptoms peripheral neuropathy guillain–barré syndrome also occurs28 duration symptoms varies usually weeks28
nonspecific character symptoms often recognized signs infection even cases seen family doctor hospital often misdiagnosed many common infectious diseases overlapping symptoms thus recommended considered people presenting unexplained fever risk factors infection28
clinical latency
initial symptoms followed stage called clinical latency asymptomatic chronic hiv1 without treatment second stage natural history infection last three years30 years31 average eight years32 typically symptoms first near stage many people experience fever weight loss gastrointestinal problems muscle pains1 people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy characterized unexplained nonpainful enlargement group lymph nodes groin three months2
although hiv1 infected individuals detectable viral load absence treatment eventually progress aids small proportion retain high levels cells helper cells without antiretroviral therapy years2833 individuals classified controllers longterm nonprogressors ltnp33 another group consists maintain undetectable viral load without antiretroviral treatment known elite controllers elite suppressors represent approximately infected persons34
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome




main symptoms aids


acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids defined terms either cell count cells occurrence specific diseases association infection28 absence specific treatment around half people infected develop aids within years28 common initial conditions alert presence aids pneumocystis pneumonia cachexia form wasting syndrome esophageal candidiasis28 common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections28
opportunistic infections caused bacteria viruses fungi parasites normally controlled immune system35 infections occur depends partly organisms common persons environment28 infections affect nearly every organ system36

testing
people infected develop specific antibodies seroconvert within three twelve weeks initial infection28 diagnosis primary seroconversion done measuring hivrna antigen28 positive results obtained antibody testing confirmed either different antibody pcr26
antibody tests children younger months typically inaccurate continued presence maternal antibodies105 thus infection diagnosed testing testing antigen26 much world lacks access reliable testing many places simply wait either symptoms develop child enough accurate antibody testing105 subsaharan africa 2007–2009 population aware status106 2009 women subsaharan countries tested106 represented significant increase compared previous years106
