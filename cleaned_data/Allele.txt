allele əˈliːl variant form given gene3 sometimes different alleles result different observable phenotypic traits different pigmentation good example trait color variation work gregor mendel white purple flower colors plants discovering color result “pure line” trait could used control future experiments however genetic variations result little observable variation
word allele short form allelomorph form word coined william bateson edith rebecca saunders45 used early days genetics describe variant forms gene detected different phenotypes derives greek prefix ἀλλήλ allel meaning reciprocal related greek adjective ἄλλος allos cognate latin alius meaning
multicellular organisms sets chromosomes diploid chromosomes referred homologous chromosomes alleles gene locus homologous chromosomes organism homozygous respect gene locus alleles different organism heterozygous respect gene

alleles lead dominant recessive phenotypesedit
main article dominance genetics
many cases genotypic interactions alleles locus described leading dominant recessive according homozygous phenotypes heterozygote resembles heterozygote indistinguishable homozygotes allele expressed leads dominant phenotype6 degree pattern dominance varies among loci type interaction first formally described gregor mendel however many traits defy simple categorization phenotypes modeled codominance polygenic inheritance
term wild type allele sometimes used describe allele thought contribute typical phenotypic character seen wild populations organisms fruit flies drosophila melanogaster wild type allele historically regarded leading dominant overpowering always expressed common normal phenotype contrast mutant alleles lead recessive rare frequently deleterious phenotypes formerly thought individuals homozygous wild type allele gene loci alternative mutant allele found homozygous form small minority affected individuals often genetic diseases frequently heterozygous form carriers mutant allele appreciated gene loci highly polymorphic multiple alleles whose frequencies vary population population great deal genetic variation hidden form alleles produce obvious phenotypic differences
multiple allelesedit















color inherited trait influenced gene including oca2 herc2 interaction multiple genes—and variation genes alleles individuals—help determine persons color phenotype color influenced pigmentation iris frequencydependence light scattering turbid medium within stroma iris






blood group system person type blood displays aantigens genotype iaia person type blood displays bantigens genotype ibib person type blood displays bantigens genotype iaib person type blood displaying neither antigen genotype


population species organisms typically includes multiple alleles locus among various individuals allelic variation locus measurable number alleles polymorphism present proportion heterozygotes population null allele gene variant lacks genes normal function either expressed expressed protein inactive
example gene locus blood type carbohydrate antigens humans7 classical genetics recognizes three alleles determine compatibility blood transfusions individual possible genotypes iaia ibib iaib produce four possible phenotypes type produced iaia homozygous heterozygous genotypes type produced ibib homozygous heterozygous genotypes type produced iaib heterozygous genotype type produced homozygous genotype known alleles actually class multiple alleles different sequences produce proteins identical properties alleles known locus8 hence individual type blood heterozygote homozygote heterozygote different alleles
genotype frequenciesedit

allelic dominance genetic disordersedit
number genetic disorders caused individual inherits recessive alleles singlegene trait recessive genetic disorders include albinism cystic fibrosis galactosemia phenylketonuria tay–sachs disease disorders also recessive alleles gene locus located chromosome males copy hemizygous frequent males females examples include redgreen color blindness fragile syndrome
disorders huntington disease occur individual inherits dominant allele
epiallelesedit
heritable traits typically studied terms genetic alleles epigenetic marks methylation inherited specific genomic regions certain species process termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance term epiallele used distinguish heritable marks traditional alleles defined nucleotide sequence9 specific class epiallele metastable epialleles discovered mice humans characterized stochastic probabilistic establishment epigenetic state mitotically inherited1011
