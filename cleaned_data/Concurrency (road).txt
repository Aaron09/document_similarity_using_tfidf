extreme example business concurrently greensboro north carolina rerouted concurrency 2008


concurrencies simply combination route numbers physical road often practically advantageous well economically advantageous better route numbers combined along riverways mountain valleys nations allow concurrencies occur however nations specifically allow happen nations permit concurrencies become common countries variety concurrences occur
example concurrency interstate pennsylvania turnpike western pennsylvania merges pennsylvania turnpike route number ultimately continue east maryland instead second physical highway built carry route combined pennsylvania turnpike designation10 triple interstate concurrency found north madison wisconsin i9411 wisconsin another triple interstate concurrency along fivemile section i894 milwaukee wisconsin12 concurrency roadway example wrongway concurrency
longest interstate highway concurrency miles across indiana ohio13
examples eightway concurrencies i465 around indianapolis georgia state route loop around downtown athens georgia portions 53mile i465 overlap 67—a total eight routes seven eight designations overlap exits create eightway concurrency14

concurrent highway ontario


united states concurrencies simply marked placing signs routes adjacent posts federal manual uniform traffic control devices prescribes mounting adjacent signs together numbers arranged vertically horizontally order precedence order used interstate highways highways state highways finally county roads within class increasing numerical value15
several states officially concurrencies instead officially ending routes side onea several circumstances unusual concurrencies exist along state borders example occurs along oklahoma–arkansas state line northern border oklahoma state highway runs concurrently arkansas highway roads north–south along boundary17
concurrencies also found canada manitoba transcanada highway winnipeg portage prairie concurrently signed yellowhead highway18 ontario queen elizabeth highway concurrently burlington oakville forming provinces concurrency 400series highways19

westbound highway southwestern virginia simultaneously carries interstate interstate opposite directions wrongway concurrency also reflected route route concurrent respectively






example wrongway concurrency oklahoma city oklahoma wrongway concurrency highlighted


highways united states canada usually signed assigned cardinal directions based primary orientation possible stretch roadway shared highways signed opposite conflicting cardinal directions wrongway concurrency refers situation road pointed third direction example near wytheville virginia concurrency runs primarily north–south signed interstate runs primarily northeast–southwest also signed north–south road oriented east–west carries interstates signed opposite directions leading city nickname whichwayville23 might simultaneously north south actually traveling west24 another example near birch michigan northbound southbound physically westbound road direction southbound northbound25
unusual example threedirectional concurrency occurs near starks illinois utilize railroad underpass route illinois route converge hence drivers traveling east west south actual compass direction simultaneously26
effect exit numbersedit
often routes exit numbers overlap routes exit numbers dominate sometimes result exits number albeit along highway although case number miles apart example concurrency near jackson michigan concurrent section freeway exit m106 numbered exit using i94s mileagebased numbers also another exit southern business loop mount pleasant michigan 127s mile markers michigan reflect cumulative distance north ohio state line numbers resume north overlap reflect distance accumulated concurrency27
however also instances dominant exit number range secondary routes highest exit number example concurrency atlanta georgia—where dominant—the exit numbers range i85s highest independent mile marker georgia 17928
