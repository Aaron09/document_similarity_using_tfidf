nextgeneration network packetbased network provide services including telecommunication services able make multiple broadband quality serviceenabled transport technologies servicerelated functions independent underlying transportrelated technologies offers unrestricted access users different service providers supports generalized mobility allow consistent ubiquitous provision services users1

practical perspective involves three main architectural changes need looked separately

core network implies consolidation several dedicated overlay transport networks historically built different service core transport network often based ethernet implies amongst others migration voice circuitswitched architecture pstn voip also migration legacy services frame relay either commercial migration customer service like technical emigration emulation legacy service
wired access network implies migration dual system legacy voice next xdsl setup local exchanges converged setup dslams integrate voice ports voip making possible remove voice switching infrastructure exchange2
cable access network convergence implies migration constant rate voice cablelabs packetcable standards provide voip services services ride docsis cable data layer standard

defined separation transport connectivity portion network services transport means whenever provider wants enable service defining directly service layer without considering transport layer services independent transport details increasingly applications including voice tend independent access network delayering network applications reside enduser devices phone settop
