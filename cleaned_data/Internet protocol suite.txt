stanford research institute packet radio used first threeway internetworked transmission


internet protocol suite resulted research development conducted defense advanced research projects agency darpa late 1960s3 initiating pioneering arpanet 1969 darpa started work number data transmission technologies 1972 robert kahn joined darpa information processing technology office worked satellite packet networks groundbased radio packet networks recognized value able communicate across spring 1973 vinton cerf developer existing arpanet network control program protocol joined kahn work openarchitecture interconnection models goal designing next protocol generation arpanet
summer 1973 kahn cerf worked fundamental reformulation differences local network protocols hidden using common internetwork protocol instead network responsible reliability arpanet function delegated hosts cerf credits hubert zimmermann louis pouzin designer cyclades network important influences design protocol implemented transmission control program first published 19744
initially managed datagram transmissions routing protocol grew researchers recommended division functionality protocol layers advocates included jonathan postel university southern californias information sciences institute edited request comments rfcs technical strategic document series documented catalyzed internet development5 postel stated screwing design internet protocols violating principle layering6 encapsulation different mechanisms intended create environment upper layers could access needed lower layers monolithic design would inflexible lead scalability issues transmission control program split distinct protocols transmission control protocol internet protocol

computer called router provided interface network forwards network packets back forth them7 originally router called gateway term changed avoid confusion types gatewayscitation needed
specificationedit
1973 1974 cerfs networking research group stanford worked details idea resulting first specification8 significant technical influence early networking work xerox parc produced parc universal packet protocol suite much existed around time
darpa contracted technologies stanford university university college london develop operational versions protocol different hardware platforms four versions developed tcpip last protocol still today 1975 twonetwork tcpip communications test performed stanford university college london november 1977 threenetwork tcpip test conducted sites norway several tcpip prototypes developed multiple research centers 1978 1983 migration arpanet tcpip officially completed flag january 1983 protocols permanently activated9
adoptionedit
march 1982 department defense declared tcpip standard military computer networking10 1985 internet advisory board later renamed internet architecture board held threeday workshop tcpip computer industry attended vendor representatives promoting protocol leading increasing commercial
1985 first interop conference focused network interoperability broader adoption tcpip conference founded lynch early internet activist beginning large corporations attended meeting interoperability conferences held every year since every year 1985 1993 number attendees tripledcitation needed
first major corporations adopt tcpip despite competing internal protocols decnet 1984 barry appelmans group tcpip development appelman later moved head development efforts navigated corporate politics stream tcpip products various systems including time several smaller companies began offering tcpip stacks windows company software wollongong group11 first vmcms tcpip stack came university wisconsin12
tcpip stacks written singlehandedly programmers elinsky oleg vishnepolsky research wrote tcpip stacks vmcms respectively13 1984 donald gillies wrote ntcp multiconnection atop ippacketdriver layer maintained john romkey 19834 romkey leveraged 1986 software founded1415 phil karn created ka9q multiconnection radio applications starting 198516
spread tcpip fueled june 1989 agreed place tcpip code developed unix public domain various vendors including included code tcpip stacks many companies sold tcpip stacks windows microsoft released native tcpip stack windows event little late evolution internet cemented tcpips dominance protocols began lose ground protocols included systems network architecture digital equipment corporations decnet open systems interconnection xerox network systems
architectural principlesedit
early architectural document 1122 emphasizes architectural principles layering17
endtoend principle evolved time original expression maintenance state overall intelligence edges assumed internet connected edges retained state concentrated speed simplicity realworld needs firewalls network address translators content caches like forced changes principle18
robustness principle states general implementation must conservative sending behavior liberal receiving behavior must careful send wellformed datagrams must accept datagram interpret object technical errors meaning still clear19 second part principle almost important software hosts contain deficiencies make unwise exploit legal obscure protocol features20 postel famously summarized principle conservative liberal accept others—a saying came known postels
abstraction layersedit







internet hosts connected routers corresponding layers used application host executes read write operations processes directly connected kind data pipe every detail communication hidden process underlying mechanisms transmit data host computers located lower protocol layers










encapsulation application data descending layers described 1122





encapsulation used provide abstraction protocols services encapsulation usually aligned division protocol suite layers general functionality general application highest level model uses protocols send data layers encapsulated level
layers protocol suite near logically closer user application near bottom logically closer physical transmission data viewing layers providing consuming service method abstraction isolate upper layer protocols details transmitting bits example ethernet collision detection lower layers avoid know details every application protocol
even layers examined assorted architectural documents—there single architectural model 7498 open systems interconnection model—have fewer less rigidly defined layers model thus provide easier realworld protocols frequently referenced document 1958 contain stack layers lack emphasis layering major difference ietf approaches refers existence internetworking layer generally upper layers document intended 1996 snapshot architecture internet architecture grown evolutionary fashion modest beginnings rather grand plan process evolution main reasons technologys success nevertheless seems useful record snapshot current principles internet architecture
1122 entitled host requirements structured paragraphs referring layers document refers many architectural principles emphasizing layering loosely defines fourlayer model layers names numbers follows

application layer scope within applications create user data communicate data applications another host applications processes make services provided underlying lower layers especially transport layer provides reliable unreliable pipes processes communications partners characterized application architecture clientserver model peertopeer networking layer higher level protocols smtp http operate processes addressed ports essentially represent services
transport layer performs hosttohost communications either different hosts either local network remote networks separated routers provides channel communication needs applications basic transport layer protocol providing unreliable datagram service transmission control protocol provides flowcontrol connection establishment reliable transmission data
internet layer task exchanging datagrams across network boundaries provides uniform networking interface hides actual topology layout underlying network connections therefore also referred layer establishes internetworking indeed defines establishes internet layer defines addressing routing structures used tcpip protocol suite primary protocol scope internet protocol defines addresses function routing transport datagrams next router connectivity network closer final data destination
link layer defines networking methods within scope local network link hosts communicate without intervening routers layer includes protocols used describe local network topology interfaces needed effect transmission internet layer datagrams nextneighbor hosts

internet protocol suite layered protocol stack design model established since tcpip model compared model books classrooms often results confusion models different assumptions goals including relative importance strict layering
abstraction also allows upper layers provide services lower layers provide original model extended include connectionless services osirm cl21 designed reliable best effort delivery protocol means transport layer implementations must choose whether provide reliability provides data integrity checksum guarantee delivery provides data integrity delivery guarantee retransmitting receiver acknowledges reception packet
model lacks formalism model associated documents ietf formal model consider limitation illustrated comment david clark reject kings presidents voting believe rough consensus running code criticisms model made respect model often consider isos later extensions model
multiaccess links addressing systems ethernet address mapping protocol needed protocols considered existing link system ietf terminology subnetwork dependent convergence facility according extension model internal organization network layer ionl22
icmp igmp operate transport data like functionality exists layer management extensions model management framework osirm mf23
ssltls library operates transport layer uses application protocols intention part designers protocols comply architecture
link treated black ietf explicitly intend discuss transmission systems less academiccitation needed practical alternative model
following description layer tcpip networking model starting lowest level
link layeredit
link layer networking scope local network connection host attached regime called link tcpip literature lowest component layer internet protocols tcpip designed hardware independent result tcpip implemented virtually hardware networking technology
link layer used move packets internet layer interfaces different hosts link processes transmitting receiving packets given link controlled software device driver network card well firmware specialized chipsets perform data link functions adding packet header prepare transmission actually transmit frame physical medium tcpip model includes specifications translating network addressing methods used internet protocol link layer addresses media access control addresses aspects level however implicitly assumed exist link layer explicitly defined
also layer packets selected sent virtual private network networking tunnel scenario link layer data considered application data traverses another instantiation stack transmission reception another connection connection virtual link established transport protocol even application scope protocol serves tunnel link layer protocol stack thus tcpip model dictate strict hierarchical encapsulation sequence
tcpip models link layer corresponds open systems interconnection model physical data link layers layers model
internet layeredit
internet layer responsibility sending packets across potentially multiple networks internetworking requires sending data source network destination network process called routing
internet protocol performs basic functions

host addressing identification accomplished hierarchical addressing system
packet routing basic task sending packets data datagrams source destination forwarding next network router closer final destination

internet layer agnostic data structures transport layer also distinguish operation various transport layer protocols carries data variety different upper layer protocols protocols identified unique protocol number example internet control message protocol icmp internet group management protocol igmp protocols respectively
protocols carried icmp used transmit diagnostic information igmp used manage multicast data layered perform internetworking functions illustrates differences architecture tcpip stack internet model tcpip models internet layer corresponds layer three open systems interconnection model referred network layer
internet layer provides unreliable datagram transmission facility hosts located potentially different networks forwarding transport layer datagrams appropriate nexthop router relaying destination functionality internet layer makes possible internetworking interworking different networks essentially establishes internet internet protocol principal component internet layer defines addressing systems identify network hosts computers locate network original address system arpanet successor internet internet protocol version ipv4 uses 32bit address therefore capable identifying approximately four billion hosts limitation eliminated 1998 standardization internet protocol version ipv6 uses 128bit addresses ipv6 production implementations emerged approximately 2006
transport layeredit
transport layer establishes basic data channels applications taskspecific data exchange layer establishes processtoprocess connectivity meaning provides endtoend services independent structure user data logistics exchanging information particular specific purpose responsibility includes endtoend message transfer independent underlying network along error control segmentation flow control congestion control application addressing port numbers endtoend message transmission connecting applications transport layer categorized either connectionoriented implemented connectionless implemented
purpose providing processspecific transmission channels applications layer establishes concept port numbered logical construct allocated specifically communication channels application needs many types services port numbers standardized client computers address specific services server computer without involvement service announcements directory services
provides best effort delivery transport layer protocols offer reliability however reliable data link protocol highlevel data link control hdlc
example connectionoriented protocol addresses numerous reliability issues providing reliable byte stream

data arrives inorder
data minimal error correctness
duplicate data discarded
lost discarded packets resent
includes traffic congestion control

newer stream control transmission protocol sctp also reliable connectionoriented transport mechanism messagestreamoriented—not bytestreamoriented like tcp—and provides multiple streams multiplexed single connection also provides multihoming support connection represented multiple addresses representing multiple physical interfaces fails connection interrupted developed initially telephony applications transport also used applications
user datagram protocol connectionless datagram protocol like best effort unreliable protocol reliability addressed error detection using weak checksum algorithm typically used applications streaming media audio video voice ontime arrival important reliability simple queryresponse applications like lookups overhead setting reliable connection disproportionately large realtime transport protocol datagram protocol designed realtime data streaming audio video
applications given network address distinguished port convention certain well known ports associated specific applications
tcpip models transport hosttohost layer corresponds fourth layer open systems interconnection model also called transport layer
application layeredit
application layer includes protocols used applications providing user services exchanging application data network connections established lower level protocols include basic network support services protocols routing host configuration examples application layer protocols include hypertext transfer protocol http file transfer protocol simple mail transfer protocol smtp dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp24 data coded according application layer protocols encapsulated transport layer protocol units messages turn lower layer protocols effect actual data transfer
tcpip model consider specifics formatting presenting data define additional layers application transport layers model presentation session layers functions realm libraries application programming interfaces
application layer protocols generally treat transport layer lower protocols black boxes provide stable network connection across communicate although applications usually aware qualities transport layer connection point addresses port numbers application layer protocols often associated particular clientserver applications common services wellknown port numbers reserved internet assigned numbers authority iana example hypertext transfer protocol uses server port telnet uses server port clients connecting service usually ephemeral ports port numbers assigned duration transaction random specific range configured application
transport layer lowerlevel layers unconcerned specifics application layer protocols routers switches typically examine encapsulated traffic rather provide conduit however firewall bandwidth throttling applications must interpret application data example resource reservation protocol rsvp also sometimes necessary network address translator traversal consider application payload
application layer tcpip model often compared equivalent combination fifth session sixth presentation seventh application layers open systems interconnection model
furthermore tcpip reference model distinguishes user protocols support protocols25 support protocols provide services system user protocols used actual user applications example user protocol support protocol
