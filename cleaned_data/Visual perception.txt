visual systemedit
main article visual system
visual system animals allows individuals assimilate information surroundings seeing starts cornea lens focuses light surroundings onto lightsensitive membrane back called retina retina actually part brain isolated serve transducer conversion light neuronal signals based feedback visual system lens adjusts thickness focus light photoreceptive cells retina also known rods cones detect photons light respond producing neural impulses signals processed complex feedforward feedback processes different parts brain retina upstream central ganglia brain
note much paragraph could apply octopuses mollusks worms insects things primitive anything concentrated nervous system better eyes jellyfish however following applies mammals generally birds modified form retina complex animals sends fibers optic nerve lateral geniculate nucleus primary secondary visual cortex brain signals retina also travel directly retina superior colliculus
perception objects totality visual scene accomplished visual association cortex visual association cortex combines sensory information perceived striate cortex contains thousands modules part modular neural networks neurons striate cortex send axons extrastriate cortex region visual association cortex surrounds striate cortex1
human visual system perceives visible light range wavelengths nanometers 000000037 000000073 meters electromagnetic spectrum2

also twostreams hypothesis
major problem visual perception people simply translation retinal stimuli image retina thus people interested perception long struggled explain visual processing create actually seen
early studiesedit




visual dorsal stream green ventral stream purple shown much human cerebral cortex involved vision


major ancient greek schools providing primitive explanation vision carried body
first emission theory maintained vision occurs rays emanate eyes intercepted visual objects object seen directly means rays coming eyes falling object refracted image however seen means rays well came eyes traversed refraction fell visible object sighted result movement rays theory championed scholars like euclid ptolemy followers
second school advocated socalled intromission approach sees vision coming something entering eyes representative object main propagators aristotle galen followers theory seems contact modern theories vision really remained speculation lacking experimental foundation eighteenthcentury england isaac newton john locke others carried intromissionintromittist theory forward insisting vision involved process rays—composed actual corporeal matter—emanated seen objects entered seers mindsensorium eyes aperture3
schools thought relied upon principle like known like thus upon notion composed internal fire interacted external fire visible light made vision possible plato makes assertion dialogue timaeus aristotle sensu4




leonardo vinci central line everything reaches central line seen distinctly


alhazen 1040 carried many investigations experiments visual perception extended work ptolemy binocular vision commented anatomical works galen56 first person explain vision occurs light bounces object directed ones eyes7
leonardo vinci 1452–1519 believed first recognize special optical qualities wrote function human described large number authors certain found completely different main experimental finding distinct clear vision line sight—the optical line ends fovea although words literally actually father modern distinction foveal peripheral visioncitation needed
issac newton 1642–172627 first discover experimentation isolating individual colors spectrum light passing prism visually perceived color objects appeared character light objects reflected divided colors could changed color contrary scientific expectation day8
unconscious inferenceedit
main article unconscious inference
hermann helmholtz often credited first study visual perception modern times helmholtz examined human concluded optically rather poor poorquality information gathered seemed make vision impossible therefore concluded vision could result form unconscious inferences matter making assumptions conclusions incomplete data based previous experiences9
inference requires prior experience world
examples wellknown assumptions based visual experience

light comes
objects normally viewed
faces seen recognized upright10
closer objects block view distant objects vice versa
figures foreground objects tend convex borders

study visual illusions cases inference process goes wrong yielded much insight sort assumptions visual system makes
another type unconscious inference hypothesis based probabilities recently revived socalled bayesian studies visual perception11 proponents approach consider visual system performs form bayesian inference derive perception sensory data however clear proponents view derive principle relevant probabilities required bayesian equation models based idea used describe various visual perceptual functions perception motion perception depth figureground perception1213 wholly empirical theory perception related newer approach rationalizes visual perception without explicitly invoking bayesian formalisms
gestalt theoryedit
main article gestalt psychology
gestalt psychologists working primarily 1930s 1940s raised many research questions studied vision scientists today
gestalt laws organization guided study people perceive visual components organized patterns wholes instead many different parts gestalt german word partially translates configuration pattern along whole emergent structure according theory eight main factors determine visual system automatically groups elements patterns proximity similarity closure symmetry common fate common motion continuity well good gestalt pattern regular simple orderly past experience
analysis movementedit
also movement




movement first seconds yarbus 1967


1960s technical development permitted continuous registration movement reading14 picture viewing15 later visual problem solving16 headsetcameras became available also driving17

following fixations jump face face might even permit comparisons faces
concluded icon face attractive search icon within peripheral field vision foveal vision adds detailed information peripheral first impression
also noted three different types movements vergence movements saccadic movements pursuit movements vergence movements involve cooperation eyes allow image fall area retinas results single focused image saccadic movements type movement makes jumps position another position used rapidly scan particular sceneimage lastly pursuit movement smooth movement used follow objects motion18
face object recognitionedit
considerable evidence face object recognition accomplished distinct systems example prosopagnosic patients show deficits face object processing object agnosic patients notably patient show deficits object processing spared face processing19 behaviorally shown faces objects subject inversion effects leading claim faces special1920 face object processing recruit distinct neural systems21 notably argued apparent specialization human brain face processing reflect true domain specificity rather general process expertlevel discrimination within given class stimulus22 though latter claim subject substantial debate using fmri electrophysiology doris tsao colleagues described brain regions mechanism face recognition macaque monkeys23
cognitive computational approachesedit
1970s david marr developed multilevel theory vision analyzed process vision different levels abstraction order focus understanding specific problems vision identified three levels analysis computational algorithmic implementational levels many vision scientists including tomaso poggio embraced levels analysis employed characterize vision computational perspectivecitation needed
computational level addresses high level abstraction problems visual system must overcome algorithmic level attempts identify strategy used solve problems finally implementational level attempts explain solutions problems realized neural circuitry
marr suggested possible investigate vision levels independently marr described vision proceeding twodimensional visual array retina threedimensional description world output stages vision include

primal sketch scene based feature extraction fundamental components scene including edges regions note similarity concept pencil sketch drawn quickly artist impression
sketch scene textures acknowledged note similarity concept stage drawing artist highlights shades areas scene provide depth
model scene visualized continuous 3dimensional map24

marrs sketch assumes depth constructed basis shape perception however stereoscopic pictorial perception well monocular viewing make clear perception shape precedes rely perception depth points clear preliminary depth could principle constructed would address question figureground organization grouping role perceptual organizing constraints overlooked marr production shape percepts binocularlyviewed objects demonstrated empirically case wire objects eg25 detailed discussion pizlo 200826
transductionedit
main article visual phototransduction
transduction process energy environmental stimuli converted neural activity brain understand process back contains three different cell layers photoreceptor layer bipolar cell layer ganglion cell layer photoreceptor layer back contains photoreceptors cone photoreceptors cones responsible color perception three different cones green blue rods responsible perception objects light27 photoreceptors contain within special chemical called photopigment embedded membrane lamellae single human contains approximately million photopigment molecules consist parts opsin protein retinal lipid28 specific photopigments color respond specific wavelengths light appropriate wavelength light hits photoreceptor photopigment splits sends message bipolar cell layer turn sends message ganglion cells send information optic nerve brain appropriate photopigment proper photoreceptor example green photopigment inside cone condition called color vision deficiency occur29
