recovery consoleedit




recovery console usually used recover unbootable systems


main article recovery console
recovery console outside installed copy windows perform maintenance tasks neither within feasibly another computer copy windows 200094 usually used recover system problems cause booting fail would render tools useless like safe mode last known good configuration chkdsk includes commands like fixmbr present msdos
simple command line interface used check repair hard drives repair boot information including ntldr replace corrupted system files fresh copies enabledisable services drivers next boot
console accessed either ways

distributed file systemedit
main article distributed file system microsoft
distributed file system allows shares multiple different locations logically grouped folder root users access network share root user really looking link server transparently redirects correct file server share root exist windows 2000 version part server family root exist server
ways implementing namespace windows 2000 either standalone root domainbased root standalone allows roots local computer thus active directory domainbased roots exist within active directory information distributed domain controllers within domain provides fault tolerance roots exist domain must hosted domain controller domain member server file root information replicated microsoft file replication service frs100
active directoryedit
main article active directory
organizing windows network domains groups resources called active directory introduced windows 2000 replace windows earlier domain model active directorys hierarchical nature allowed administrators builtin manage user computer policies user accounts automatically deploy programs updates greater degree scalability centralization provided previous windows versions user information stored active directory also provided convenient phone booklike function users active directory domains vary small installations hundred objects large installations millions active directory organise link groups domains contiguous domain name space form trees groups trees outside namespace linked together form forests
active directory services could always installed windows 2000 server advanced server datacenter server computer cannot installed windows 2000 professional computer however windows 2000 professional first client operating system able exploit active directorys features part organizations migration windows clients continued function clients upgraded windows 2000 professional point active directory domain could switched native mode maximum functionality achieved
active directory requires server supports resource records organizations existing infrastructure upgraded support domain controllers hold active directory database provide active directory directory services
volume fault toleranceedit
along support simple spanned striped volumes server family windows 2000 also supports faulttolerant volume types types supported mirrored volumes raid5 volumes

mirrored volumes volume contains several disks data written also written disks means disk fails data totally recovered disk mirrored volumes also known raid1
raid5 volumes raid5 volume consists multiple disks uses blocklevel striping parity data distributed across member disks disk fail array parity blocks surviving disks combined mathematically data blocks surviving disks reconstruct data failed drive onthefly
