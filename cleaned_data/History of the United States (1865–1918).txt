historians interpretations radical republicans dramatically shifted years pre1950 view tools business motivated partisanship hatred white south perspective neoabolitionists 1950s afterwards applauded efforts give equal rights freed slaves10
south interpretation tumultuous 1860s differed sharply race americans often interpreted great events religious terms historian wilson fallin contrasts interpretation civil reconstruction white versus black using baptist sermons alabama white preachers expressed view

chastised given special mission maintain orthodoxy strict biblicism personal piety traditional race relations slavery insisted sinful rather emancipation historical tragedy reconstruction clear sign gods favor

sharp contrast black preachers interpreted civil emancipation reconstruction

gods gift freedom appreciated opportunities exercise independence worship affirm worth dignity proclaim fatherhood brotherhood could form churches associations conventions institutions offered selfhelp racial uplift provided places gospel liberation could proclaimed result black preachers continued insist would protect help would rock stormy land11

historians 21st century typically consider reconstruction failure disagree caused reconstruction fail focusing whether went fast enough12
however historian mark summers 2014 sees positive outcome

reconstructions purpose making sure main goals would filled union held together forever north south able work together slavery extirpated sectional rivalries confined permanent banishment fear vaunting appeals state sovereignty backed armed force reconstruction looks like respect lasting unappreciated success13
