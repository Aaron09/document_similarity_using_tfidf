distributed system nodesedit
network question distributed system nodes clients servers peers peer sometimes serve client sometimes server peertopeer overlay network nodes actively route data networked devices well called supernodes
distributed systems sometimes virtual nodes system oblivious heterogeneity nodes issue addressed special algorithms like consistent hashing case amazons2
node cloud computingedit
within vast computer network individual computers periphery network also connect networks often connect transiently clouds called nodes typically within cloud computing construct individual user customer computer connects wellmanaged cloud called node since computers part network unmanaged clouds host present significant risks entire cloud called node problem3 several means remedy problem require instilling trust node computer4
