compound chemical substance composed many identical molecules molecular entities composed atoms element held together chemical bonds
four types compounds depending constituent atoms held together

molecules held together covalent bonds
ionic compounds held together ionic bonds
intermetallic compounds held together metallic bonds
certain complexes held together coordinate covalent bonds

many chemical compounds unique numerical identifier assigned chemical abstracts service number
chemical formula expressing information proportions atoms constitute particular chemical compound using standard abbreviations chemical elements subscripts indicate number atoms involved example water composed hydrogen atoms bonded oxygen atom chemical formula
compound converted different chemical composition interaction second chemical compound chemical reaction process bonds atoms broken interacting compounds bonds reformed associations made atoms schematically reaction could described unique atoms unique compounds
chemical element bonded identical chemical element chemical compound since element different elements involved examples diatomic molecule hydrogen polyatomic molecule sulfur





pure water example compound ballandstick model molecule shows spatial association parts hydrogen white parts oxygen

substance consisting different types atoms chemical elements fixed proportion atoms stoichiometry termed chemical compound concept readily understood considering pure chemical substances115 follows composed fixed proportions types atoms chemical compounds converted chemical reaction compounds substances fewer atoms4 ratio element compound expressed ratio chemical formula5 case nonstoichiometric compounds proportions reproducible regard preparation give fixed proportions component elements proportions integral palladium hydride pdhx 0586 chemical compounds unique defined chemical structure held together defined spatial arrangement chemical bonds chemical compounds molecular compounds held together covalent bonds salts held together ionic bonds intermetallic compounds held together metallic bonds subset chemical complexes held together coordinate covalent bonds7 pure chemical elements generally considered chemical compounds failing atom requirement though often consist molecules composed multiple atoms diatomic molecule polyatomic molecule etc7
varying sometimes inconsistent nomenclature differentiating substances include truly nonstoichiometric examples chemical compounds require fixed ratios many solid chemical substances—for example many silicate minerals—are chemical substances simple formulae reflecting chemically bonding elements another fixed ratios even crystalline substances often called nonstoichiometric compounds argued related rather chemical compounds insofar variability compositions often either presence foreign elements trapped within crystal structure otherwise known true chemical compound perturbations structure relative known compound arise excess deficit constituent elements places structure nonstoichiometric substances form crust mantle earth compounds regarded chemically identical varying amounts heavy light isotopes constituent elements changes ratio elements mass slightly
bonding forcesedit
compounds held together variety different types bonding forces differences types bonds compounds differ based types elements present compound
london dispersion forces weakest force intermolecular forces temporary attractive forces form electrons adjacent atoms positioned create temporary dipole additionally london dispersion forces responsible condensing polar substances liquids freeze solid state dependent temperature environment
covalent bond also known molecular bond involves sharing electrons atoms primarily type bond occurs elements fall close periodic table elements observed metals nonmetals mechanism type bond elements fall close periodic table tend similar electronegativities means similar affinity electrons since neither element stronger affinity donate gain electrons causes elements share electrons elements stable octet
ionic bonding occurs valence electrons completely transferred elements opposite covalent bonding chemical bond creates oppositely charged ions metals ionic bonding usually lose valence electrons becoming positively charged cation nonmetal gain electrons metal making nonmetal negatively charged anion outlined ionic bonds occur electron donor usually metal electron acceptor tends nonmetal9
hydrogen bonding occurs hydrogen atom bonded electronegative atom forms electrostatic connection another electronegative atom interacting dipoles charges10111213
