acts read reliable history early church well postreformation 17th century however biblical scholars began notice incomplete tendentious—its picture harmonious church quite odds given pauls letters omits important events deaths peter paul mid19thcentury scholar ferdinand baur suggested luke rewritten history present united peter paul advance single orthodoxy marcionites marcion 2ndcentury heretic wished christianity entirely jews baur continues enormous influence today less interest determining lukes historical accuracy although never died understanding theological program24

issue debated scholars luke’s political vision regarding relationship early church roman empire hand luke generally portray interaction direct conflict rather ways considered relationship rather advantageous cause example early christians appreciated hearing protection paul received roman officials gentile rioters philippi acts 161640 ephesus acts 192341 jewish rioters occasions acts 17117 acts 181217 meanwhile roman readers approved paul’s censure illegal practice magic acts 191719 well amicability rapport roman officials sergius paulus acts 13612 festus acts 263032 furthermore acts include account struggle christians roman government result latter’s imperial cult thus paul depicted moderating presence church roman empire40
hand events imprisonment paul hands empire acts 2228 well several encounters reflect negatively roman officials instance felix’s desire bribe paul acts 2426 function concrete points conflict rome early church41 perhaps significant point tension roman imperial ideology luke’s political vision reflected peter’s speech roman centurion cornelius acts 1036 peter states “this one” οὗτος jesus lord κύριος all” title κύριος often ascribed roman emperor antiquity rendering luke appellation jesus unsubtle challenge emperor’s authority42 thus overt relationship christianity empire book acts generally characterized irenic luke insinuates inevitability conflict issue ultimate allegiance
