reciprocityedit




time clock shorter compared time clock shorter compared


given certain frame reference stationary observer described earlier second observer accompanied moving clock observers would perceive others clock ticking slower rate local clock perceiving thats motion relative stationary frame reference
common sense would dictate passage time slowed moving object said object would observe external worlds time correspondingly sped counterintuitively special relativity predicts opposite observers motion relative measure others clock slowing concordance moving relative observers frame reference
seems selfcontradictory similar oddity occurs everyday life person sees person person appear small time person appear small person familiar effects perspective contradiction paradox situation16
reciprocity phenomenon also leads socalled twin paradox aging twins staying earth embarking space travel compared reciprocity suggests persons reunite dilemma posed paradox however explained fact twins must accelerate remains inertial
