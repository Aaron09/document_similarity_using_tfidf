buddhist views said similar idealism appear mahayana buddhist texts samdhinirmocana sutra laṅkāvatāra sūtra dashabhumika sutra etc24 later expanded upon indian buddhist philosophers like vasubandhu asaṅga dharmakīrti śāntarakṣita yogacara thought also promoted china chinese philosophers translators like xuanzang
modern scholarly disagreement whether yogacara buddhism said form idealism saam trivedi notes side debate writers garfield jeffrey hopkins paul williams others maintain idealism label side stefan anacker lusthaus richard king thomas kochumuttom alex wayman janice dean willis others argued yogacara idealist25 central point issue buddhist philosophers like vasubandhu used term vijñaptimatra representationonly cognitiononly formulated arguments refute external objects actually meant
vasubandhu’s works include refutation external objects externality argues true nature reality beyond subjectobject distinctions25 views ordinary consciousness experience deluded perceptions external world separate instead argues vijñapti representation conceptualization25 hence vasubandhu begins vimsatika verse consciousnessonly appearance nonexistent objects someone optical disorder nonexistent nets hair25
likewise buddhist philosopher dharmakirtis view apparent existence external objects summed pramānaṿārttika ‘commentary logic epistemology’ cognition experiences nothing else whatsoever even particular objects perception nature consciousness itself26
writers like garfield hold vasubandhu metaphysical idealist others closer epistemic idealist like kant holds knowledge world simply knowledge concepts perceptions transcendental world sean butler upholding yogacara form idealism albeit unique type notes similarity kants categories yogacaras vāsanās simply phenomenal tools mind interprets noumenal realm27 unlike kant however holds noumenon thinginitself unknowable vasubandhu holds ultimate reality knowable nonconceptual yogic perception highly trained meditative mind25
writers like lusthaus hold yogacara metaphysical idealism point example yogācāra thinkers focus consciousness assert ontologically real simply analyze experiences thus suffering created lusthaus notes indian yogācāra text ever claims world created mind claim mistake projected interpretations world world take mental constructions world28 lusthaus notes similarities western epistemic idealists like kant husserl enough yogacara seen form epistemological idealism however also notes differences like concepts karma nirvana28 saam trivedi meanwhile notes similarities epistemic idealism yogacara adds yogacara buddhism sense theory25
