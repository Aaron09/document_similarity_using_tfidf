dyes classified according solubility chemical properties1
acid dyes watersoluble anionic dyes applied fibers silk wool nylon modified acrylic fibers using neutral acid baths attachment fiber attributed least partly salt formation anionic groups dyes cationic groups fiber acid dyes substantive cellulosic fibers synthetic food colors fall categoryexamples acid alizarine pure blue acid
basic dyes watersoluble cationic dyes mainly applied acrylic fibers find wool silk usually acetic acid added bath help uptake onto fiber basic dyes also used coloration paper
direct substantive dyeing normally carried neutral slightly alkaline bath near boiling point addition either sodium chloride nacl sodium sulfate na2so4 sodium carbonate na2co3 direct dyes used cotton paper leather wool silk nylon also used indicators biological stains
mordant dyes require mordant improves fastness water light perspiration choice mordant important different mordants change final color significantly natural dyes mordant dyes therefore large literature base describing dyeing techniques important mordant dyes synthetic mordant dyes chrome dyes used wool comprise dyes used wool especially useful black navy shades mordant potassium dichromate applied aftertreatment important note many mordants particularly heavy metal category hazardous health extreme care must taken using
dyes essentially insoluble water incapable dyeing fibres directly however reduction alkaline liquor produces watersoluble alkali metal salt leuco form affinity textile fibre subsequent oxidation reforms original insoluble color denim indigo original
reactive dyes utilize chromophore attached substituent capable directly reacting fiber substrate covalent bonds attach reactive natural fibers make among permanent dyes cold reactive dyes procion cibacron drimarene easy applied room temperature reactive dyes best choice dyeing cotton cellulose fibers home studio
disperse dyes originally developed dyeing cellulose acetate waterinsoluble dyes finely ground presence dispersing agent sold paste spraydried sold powder main polyester also used nylon cellulose triacetate acrylic fibers cases dyeing temperature required pressurized dyebath used fine particle size gives large surface area aids dissolution allow uptake fiber dyeing rate significantly influenced choice dispersing agent used grinding
azoic dyeing technique insoluble produced directly onto within fiber achieved treating fiber diazoic coupling components suitable adjustment dyebath conditions components react produce required insoluble technique dyeing unique final color controlled choice diazoic coupling components method dyeing cotton declining importance toxic nature chemicals used
sulfur dyes inexpensive dyes used cotton dark colors dyeing effected heating fabric solution organic compound typically nitrophenol derivative sulfide polysulfide organic compound reacts sulfide source form dark colors adhere fabric sulfur black largest selling volume well defined chemical structure
food dyesedit
class describes role dyes rather mode food food dyes classed food additives manufactured higher standard industrial dyes food dyes direct mordant dyes strictly controlled legislation many dyes although anthraquinone triphenylmethane compounds used colors green blue naturally occurring dyes also used
