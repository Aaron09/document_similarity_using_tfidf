metadata data information provides information data1 three distinct types metadata exist descriptive metadata structural metadata administrative metadata2

descriptive metadata describes resource purposes discovery identification include elements title abstract author keywords
structural metadata metadata containers data indicates compound objects together example pages ordered form chapters describes types versions relationships characteristics digital materials
administrative metadata provides information help manage resource created file type technical information access

historyedit
metadata traditionally used card catalogs libraries 1980s libraries converted catalog data digital databases 2000s digital formats becoming prevalent storing data information metadata also used describe digital data using metadata standards
different metadata standards different discipline museum collections digital audio files websites describing contents context data data files increases usefulness example page include metadata specifying software language page written html tools used create subjects page find information subject metadata automatically improve readers experience make easier users find page online5 include metadata providing information musicians singers songwriters whose work appears disc
principal purpose metadata help users find relevant information discover resources metadata also helps organize electronic resources provide digital identification support archiving preservation resources metadata assists users resource discovery allowing resources found relevant criteria identifying resources bringing similar resources together distinguishing dissimilar resources giving location information6 metadata telecommunication activities including internet traffic widely collected various national governmental organizations data used purposes traffic analysis used mass surveillance7
many countries metadata relating emails telephone calls pages video traffic connections cell phone locations routinely stored government organizations8
definitionedit

metadata means data data although meta prefix greek preposition prefix μετά means beyond used mean epistemology metadata defined data providing information aspects data used summarize basic information data make tracking working specific data easier9 examples include

example digital image include metadata describes large picture color depth image resolution image created shutter speed data10 text documents metadata contain information long document author document written short summary document metadata within pages also contain descriptions page content well words linked content11 links often called metatags used primary factor determining order search late 1990s11 reliance metatags searches decreased late 1990s keyword stuffing11 metatags largely misused trick search engines thinking websites relevance search really did11
metadata stored managed database often called metadata registry metadata repository12 however without context point reference might impossible identify metadata looking it13 example database containing several numbers digits long could results calculations list numbers plug equation without context numbers perceived data given context database book collection 13digit numbers identified isbns information refers book information within book term metadata coined 1968 philip bagley book extension programming language concepts clear uses term 11179 traditional sense structural metadata data containers data rather alternate sense content individual instances data content metacontent type data usually found library catalogues1415 since fields information management information science information technology librarianship widely adopted term fields word metadata defined data data16page needed generally accepted definition various disciplines adopted specific explanation uses term

hierarchical linear planar schemataedit
metadata schemata hierarchical nature relationships exist metadata elements elements nested parentchild relationships exist elements example hierarchical metadata schema ieee schema metadata elements belong parent metadata element metadata schemata also onedimensional linear element completely discrete elements classified according dimension example linear metadata schema dublin core schema dimensional metadata schemata often dimensional planar element completely discrete elements classified according orthogonal dimensions22
hypermappingedit
cases metadata schemata exceed planar depiction type hypermapping required enable display view metadata according chosen aspect serve special views hypermapping frequently applies layering geographical geological information overlays23
granularityedit
degree data metadata structured referred granularity granularity refers much detail provided metadata high granularity allows deeper detailed structured information enables greater level

technical manipulation lower level granularity means metadata created considerably lower costs provide detailed information major impact granularity creation capture moreover maintenance costs soon metadata structures become outdated access referred data hence granularity must take account effort create metadata well effort maintain
