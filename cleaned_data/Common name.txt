part folk taxonomyedit
main articles folk taxonomy nomenclature
common name intrinsically plays part classification objects typically incomplete informal classification names degenerate examples unique lack reference name case ginkgo okapi ratel3 folk taxonomy classification objects using common names formal rules need consistent logical assignment names flies called flies example braulidae socalled lice every animal called indeed dragonflies mayflies4 contrast scientific biological nomenclature global system attempts denote particular organisms taxa uniquely definitively assumption organisms taxa welldefined generally also welldefined interrelationships5 accordingly iczn formal rules biological nomenclature convenes periodic international meetings purpose6
common names binomial systemedit
form scientific names organisms called binomial nomenclature superficially similar nounadjective form vernacular names common names used prehistoric cultures collective name made precise addition adjective screech7 linnaeus published flora homeland sweden flora svecica 1745 recorded swedish common names region region well scientific names swedish common names binomials plant råglosta plant renlosta vernacular binomial system thus preceded scientific binomial system8
linnaean authority william stearn said

introduction binomial system nomenclature linnaeus gave plants animals essentially latin nomenclature like vernacular nomenclature style linked published hence relatively stable verifiable scientific concepts thus suitable international use9

geographic range useedit
geographic range particular common name used varies common names local application others virtually universal within particular language names even apply across ranges languages word instance easily recognizable germanic many romance languages many vernacular names however restricted single country colloquial names local districts10
constraints problemsedit
common names used writings professionals laymen people sometimes object scientific names common names scientific names defended remarks book marine fish11

common names often local distribution find fish single area several common names
ignorance relevant biological facts among public single species fish called several common names individuals species differ appearance depending maturity gender vary appearance morphological response natural surroundings ecophenotypic variation
contrast common names formal taxonomic names imply biological relationships similarly named creatures
incidental events contact languages simple confusion common names given region sometimes change time
book lists 1200 species fishes11 half widely recognised common name either nondescript rarely seen earned widely accepted common name
conversely single common name often applies multiple species fishes public might simply recognise care subtle differences appearance distantly related species
many species rare lack economic importance common name12

coining common namesedit
scientific binomial nomenclature names commonly derived classical modern latin greek latinised forms vernacular words coinages names generally difficult laymen learn remember pronounce books field guides biologists commonly publish lists coined common names many examples common names simply attempts translate latinised name english vernacular translation confusing confusingly inaccurate13 example gratiosus mean gracile gracilis mean graceful1415
practice coining common names long discouraged candolles laws botanical nomenclature 186816 nonbinding recommendations form basis modern binding international code nomenclature algae fungi plants contains following

every friend science ought opposed introduction modern language names plants already unless derived latin botanical name undergone slight alteration ought fabrication names termed vulgar names totally different latin ones proscribed public addressed derive advantage novelties lindleys work vegetable kingdom would better relished england author introduced many english names found dictionary preclude necessity learning latin names synonymous tolerable idea given danger great multiplicity vulgar names imagining geography would instance postoffice administration supposing every town totally different name every language

various bodies authors many technical semitechnical books simply adapt existing common names various organisms coin common comprehensive useful authoritative standardised lists names purpose typically

create names scratch common names exist
impose particular choice name common name
improve existing common names
replace names conform relatedness organisms

attempts reconcile differences widely separated regions traditions languages arbitrarily imposing nomenclature often reflect narrow perspectives unfortunate outcomes example members genus burhinus occur australia southern africa eurasia south america recent trend field manuals bird lists name thickknee members genus spite fact majority species occur nonenglishspeaking regions various common names always english example dikkop centuriesold south african vernacular name local species burhinus capensis cape dikkop gewone dikkop17 mention presumably much older zulu name umbangaqhwa burhinus vermiculatus water dikkop1819 thick joints question even fact birds’ knees intertarsal joints—in terms ankles furthermore species genus “thick knees” thickness knees species clearly descriptive significance family burhinidae members various common names even english including “stone curlews”20 choice name “thickknees” easy defend clear illustration hazards facile coinage terminology21
