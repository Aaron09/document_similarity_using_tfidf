geologically young mountain ranges earths land surface associated either pacific ring fire alpide belt pacific ring fire includes andes south america extends north american cordillera along pacific coast aleutian range kamchatka japan taiwan philippines papua guinea zealand2 andes 7000 kilometres 4350 long often considered worlds longest mountain system3
alpide belt includes indonesia southeast asia himalaya ends alps spain atlas mountains4 belt also includes european asian mountain ranges himalayas contain highest mountains world including mount everest 8848 metres 29029 high traverses border china nepal5

position mountains influences climate rain snow masses move mountains cools producing orographic precipitation rain snow descends leeward side warms accordance adiabatic lapse rate drier stripped much moisture often rain shadow affect leeward side range
erosionedit
mountain ranges constantly subjected erosional forces work tear basins adjacent eroding mountain range filled sediments buried turned sedimentary rock erosion work mountains uplifted mountains reduced hills plains
early cenozoic uplift rocky mountains colorado provides example uplift occurring 10000 feet 3000 mostly mesozoic sedimentary strata removed erosion core mountain range spread sand clays across great plains east7 mass rock removed range actively undergoing uplift removal mass core range likely caused uplift region adjusted isostatically response removed weight
rivers traditionally believed principal cause mountain range erosion cutting bedrock transporting sediment computer simulation shown mountain belts change tectonically active inactive rate erosion rate drops fewer abrasive particles water fewer landslides8
