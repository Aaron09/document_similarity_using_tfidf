liger liontiger hybrid bred captivity


term hybrid derived latin hybrida used crosses tame wild boar term came popular english 19th century though examples found early 17th century1 conspicuous hybrids popularly named portmanteau words starting 1920s breeding tiger–lion hybrids liger tigon2

animal plant breedingedit

mechanisms reproductive isolationedit
main article reproductive isolation
interspecific hybrids bred mating individuals species normally within genus offspring display traits characteristics parents often sterile preventing gene flow species24 sterility often attributed different number chromosomes species example donkeys chromosomes horses chromosomes mules hinnies chromosomes mules hinnies normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes differences chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing segregation meiosis meiosis disrupted viable sperm eggs formed however fertility female mules reported donkey father25
variety mechanisms limit success hybridization including large genetic difference species barriers include morphological differences differing times fertility mating behaviors cues physiological rejection sperm cells developing embryo fertilization others it26272829

plant hybridization commonplace compared animal hybridization many crop species hybrids including notably polyploid wheats four sets chromosomes tetraploid hexaploid wheat species like eukaryotic organisms sets diploid hybridization events likely involved doubling chromosome sets causing immediate genetic isolation39

main article heterosis
hybrids might expected always intermediate parents blending inheritance sometimes stronger either parent variety phenomenon called heterosis hybrid vigour heterozygote advantage common plant hybrids42 transgressive phenotype phenotype displays extreme characteristics either parent lines43 plant breeders several techniques produce hybrids including line breeding formation complex hybrids economically important example hybrid maize corn provides considerable seed yield advantage open pollinated varieties hybrid seed dominates commercial maize seed market united states canada many major maizeproducing countries44
hybrid trait falls outside range parental variation thus simply intermediate parents considered heterotic positive heterosis produces robust hybrids might stronger bigger term negative heterosis refers weaker smaller hybrids45 heterosis common animal plant hybrids example hybrids lion tigress ligers much larger either progenitors tigons lioness tiger smaller similarly hybrids common pheasant phasianus colchicus domestic fowl gallus gallus larger either parents produced common pheasant golden pheasant chrysolophus pictus46 spurs absent hybrids former type although present parents47
human influenceedit
anthropogenic hybridizationedit
hybridization greatly influenced human impact environment48 effects habitat fragmentation species introductions49 impacts make difficult conserve genetics populations undergoing introgressive hybridization humans introduced species worldwide environments long time intentionally purposes biological control unintentionally accidental escapes individuals introductions drastically affect populations including hybridization1350
