confused concrete mortar masonry




cement often supplied powder mixed materials water


cement binder substance used construction sets hardens adheres materials binding together cement seldom used rather bind sand gravel aggregate together cement used fine aggregate produce mortar masonry sand gravel aggregates produce concrete
cements used construction usually inorganic often lime calcium silicate based characterized either hydraulic nonhydraulic depending upon ability cement presence water hydraulic nonhydraulic lime plaster
nonhydraulic cement conditions underwater rather sets dries reacts carbon dioxide resistant attack chemicals setting
hydraulic cements portland cement become adhesive chemical reaction ingredients water chemical reaction results mineral hydrates watersoluble quite durable water safe chemical attack allows setting condition underwater protects hardened material chemical attack chemical process hydraulic cement found ancient romans used volcanic pozzolana added lime calcium oxide
word cement traced back roman term opus caementicium used describe masonry resembling modern concrete made crushed rock burnt lime binder volcanic pulverized brick supplements added burnt lime obtain hydraulic binder later referred cementum cimentum cäment cement modern times organic polymers sometimes used cements concrete
