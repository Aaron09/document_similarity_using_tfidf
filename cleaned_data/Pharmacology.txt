divisionsedit
discipline pharmacology divided many disciplines specific focus
clinical pharmacologyedit
clinical pharmacology basic science pharmacology added focus application pharmacological principles methods medical clinic towards patient care outcomes
neuropharmacologyedit
neuropharmacology study effects medication central peripheral nervous system functioning
psychopharmacologyedit
psychopharmacology also known behavioral pharmacology study effects medication psyche psychology observing changed behaviors body mind molecular events manifest measurable behavioral form psychopharmacology interdisciplinary field studies behavioral effects psychoactive drugs incorporates approaches techniques neuropharmacology animal behavior behavioral neuroscience interested behavioral neurobiological mechanisms action psychoactive drugs another goal behavioral pharmacology develop animal behavioral models screen chemical compounds therapeutic potentials people field called behavioral pharmacologists typically small animals rodents study psychotherapeutic drugs antipsychotics antidepressants anxiolytics drugs abuse nicotine cocaine methamphetamine ethopharmacology confused ethnopharmacology term since 1960s7 derives greek word ἦθος ethos meaning character pharmacology study drug actions mechanism
cardiovascular pharmacologyedit
cardiovascular pharmacology study effects drugs entire cardiovascular system including heart blood vessels
pharmacogeneticsedit
pharmacogenetics clinical testing genetic variation gives rise differing response drugs
pharmacogenomicsedit
pharmacogenomics application genomic technologies drug discovery characterization older drugs
pharmacoepidemiologyedit
pharmacoepidemiology study effects drugs large numbers people
safety pharmacologyedit
safety pharmacology specialises detecting investigating potential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects chemical entities nces physiological functions relation exposure therapeutic range
systems pharmacologyedit
systems pharmacology coding system principles field pharmacology
toxicologyedit
toxicology study adverse effects molecular targets characterization drugs chemical substance excess including beneficial lower doses
theoretical pharmacologyedit
theoretical pharmacology relatively rapidly expanding field research activity many techniques computational chemistry particular computational quantum chemistry method molecular mechanics proving great value theoretical pharmacologists rationalizing relation activity particular drug observed experimentally structural features derived computer experiments find structure—activity relations furthermore basis structure given organic molecule theoretical pharmacologist aims predicting biological activity drugs general type existing drugs ambitiously aims predict entirely classes drugs tailormade specific purposes
posologyedit
posology study medicines dosed depends upon various factors including climate weight elimination rate drug genetic polymorphism time administration derived greek words πόσος posos meaning much λογία logia study
pharmacognosyedit
pharmacognosy branch pharmacology dealing especially composition development medicinal substances biological origin especially medicinal substances obtained plants
environmental pharmacologyedit
environmental pharmacology discipline9 focus given understand gene–environment interaction drugenvironment interaction toxinenvironment interaction close collaboration environmental science medicine addressing issues healthcare cause environmental damage remediation human health ecology intimately related demand pharmaceutical products place public risk destruction species entry chemicals drugs aquatic ecosystem serious concern today addition production illegal drugs pollutes drinking water supply releasing carcinogens10 field intimately linked public health fields
experimental pharmacologyedit
experimental pharmacology involves study pharmacology bioassay test efficacy potency drug
dental pharmacologyedit
dental pharmacology relates study drugs commonly used treatment dental diseasecitation needed
scientific backgroundedit
study chemicals requires intimate knowledge biological system affected knowledge cell biology biochemistry increasing field pharmacology also changed substantially become possible molecular analysis receptors design chemicals specific cellular signaling metabolic pathways affecting sites directly cellsurface receptors modulate mediate cellular signaling pathways controlling cellular function
chemical pharmacological pointofview various properties pharmacokinetics describes effect body chemical halflife volume distribution pharmacodynamics describes chemicals effect body desired toxic
describing pharmacokinetic properties chemical active ingredient active pharmaceutical ingredient pharmacologists often interested ladme

liberation disintegrated solid oral forms breaking smaller particles dispersed dissolved medication
absorption absorbed skin intestine oral mucosa
distribution spread organism
metabolism converted chemically inside body substances active well could toxic
excretion excreted bile urine breath skin

medication said narrow wide therapeutic index therapeutic window describes ratio desired effect toxic effect compound narrow therapeutic index close exerts desired effect dose close toxic dose compound wide therapeutic index greater five exerts desired effect dose substantially toxic dose narrow margin difficult dose administer require therapeutic drug monitoring examples warfarin antiepileptics aminoglycoside antibiotics anticancer drugs narrow therapeutic margin toxic sideeffects almost always encountered doses used kill tumors
medicine development safety testingedit
development medication vital concern medicine also strong economical political implications protect consumer prevent abuse many governments regulate manufacture sale administration medication united states main body regulates pharmaceuticals food drug administration enforce standards united states pharmacopoeia european union main body regulates pharmaceuticals enforce standards european pharmacopoeia
metabolic stability reactivity library candidate drug compounds assessed drug metabolism toxicological studies many methods proposed quantitative predictions drug metabolism example recent computational method sporcalc11 chemical structure medicinal compound altered slightly could slightly dramatically alter medicinal properties compound depending level alteration relates structural composition substrate receptor site exerts medicinal effect concept referred structural activity relationship means useful activity identified chemists make many similar compounds called analogues attempt maximize desired medicinal effects compound development phase take anywhere years decade expensive12
analogues need developed needs determined safe medicine human consumption stability human body best form delivery desired organ system like tablet aerosol extensive testing take years medicine ready marketing selling12
result long time required develop analogues test medicine fact every 5000 potential medicines typically ever reach open market expensive things often costing billion dollars recoup outlay pharmaceutical companies number things12

carefully research demand potential product spending outlay company funds12
obtain patent medicine preventing companies producing medicine certain allocation time12

drug legislation safetyedit
united states food drug administration responsible creating guidelines approval drugs requires approved drugs fulfill requirements

drug must found effective disease seeking approval effective means drug performed better placebo competitors least trials
drug must meet safety criteria subject animal controlled human testing

gaining approval usually takes several years attain testing done animals must extensive must include several species help evaluation effectiveness toxicity drug dosage drug approved intended fall within range drug produces therapeutic effect desired outcome13
safety effectiveness prescription drugs regulated federal prescription drug marketing 1987
medicines healthcare products regulatory agency mhra similar role
educationedit
