uses synonym
scientific nomenclature synonym scientific name applies taxon goes different scientific name1 although term used somewhat differently zoological code nomenclature2 example linnaeus first give scientific name currently used system scientific nomenclature norway spruce called pinus abies name longer synonym current scientific name picea abies
unlike synonyms contexts taxonomy synonym interchangeable name synonym taxonomy synonyms equals different status taxon particular circumscription position rank scientific name considered correct given time correct name determined applying relevant code nomenclature synonym cannot exist isolation always alternative different scientific name given correct name taxon depends taxonomic viewpoint used resulting particular circumscription position rank name taxonomists synonym another taxonomists correct name vice versa
synonyms arise whenever taxon described named independently also arise existing taxa changed taxa joined become species moved different genus variety moved different species synonyms also come codes nomenclature change older names longer acceptable example erica herbacea rejected favour erica carnea thus synonym3

general usageedit
general user scientific names fields agriculture horticulture ecology general science synonym name previously used correct scientific name handbooks similar sources displaced another scientific name regarded correct thus oxford dictionaries online defines term taxonomic name application another especially superseded longer valid4 handbooks general texts useful synonyms mentioned current scientific name avoid confusion example much advertised name change scientific name fruit changed sophophora melanogaster would helpful mention name accompanied drosophila melanogaster synonyms used always meet strict definitions term synonym formal rules nomenclature govern scientific names
changes scientific name causes taxonomic nomenclatural name change caused changes circumscription position rank taxon representing change taxonomic scientific insight would case fruit mentioned name change purely nomenclatural reasons based rules nomenclaturecitation needed example older name rediscovered priority current name speaking general name changes nomenclatural reasons become less frequent time rules nomenclature allow names conserved promote stability scientific names

particular species could speciesrank names published
particular order could orderrank names published well

earliest published name called senior synonym later name junior synonym
basic principle zoological nomenclature earliest correctly published thus available name senior synonym default takes precedence naming rights therefore unless restrictions interfere must used taxon however junior synonyms still important document earliest name cannot used example spelling previously used name established another taxon next available junior synonym must used taxon
objective synonyms refer taxa type rank less taxon although circumscription vary even widely speciesgroup taxa rank type specimen genusgroup taxa rank type species type species objective synonyms familygroup taxa type genus etc5
case subjective synonyms shared type synonymy open taxonomic judgement6 meaning room debate researcher might consider types refer taxon another might consider belong different taxa example john edward gray published name antilocapra anteflexa 1855 species pronghorn based pair horns however commonly accepted specimen unusual individual species antilocapra americana published george 1815 ords name thus takes precedence antilocapra anteflexa junior subjective synonym
objective synonyms common rank genera various reasons genera contain type species objective synonyms7 many cases researchers established generic names thought necessary know others previously established another genus group species example genus pomatia beck 18378 established group terrestrial snails containing type species burgundy roman snail helix pomatia since helix pomatia already type species genus helix linnaeus 1758 genus pomatia objective synonym useless occasion helix also synonym pomatia older precedence
species level subjective synonyms common unexpectedly large range variation species simple ignorance earlier description lead biologist describe newly discovered specimen species common reason objective synonyms level creation replacement name
possible junior synonym given precedence senior synonym9 primarily senior name used since 1899 junior name common older name declared nomen oblitum junior name declared nomen protectum rule exists primarily prevent confusion would result wellknown name large accompanying body literature replaced completely unfamiliar name example european land snail petasina edentula draparnaud 1805 2002 researchers found older name helix depilata draparnaud 1801 referred species name never used 1899 fixed nomen oblitum rule falkner 200210
reversal precedence also possible senior synonym established 1900 international commission zoological nomenclature iczn approves application note iczn stands commission code beginning zoology related word difference names example scientific name imported fire solenopsis invicta published buren 1972 know species first named solenopsis saevissima wagneri santschi 1916 thousands publications using name invicta anyone discovered synonymy iczn 2001 ruled invicta would given precedence wagneri

botanyedit
botanical nomenclature synonym name correct circumscription position rank taxon considered particular botanical publication always synonym correct scientific name name correct depends taxonomic opinion author botany various kinds synonyms

homotypic nomenclatural synonyms sometimes indicated type specimen taxonomic rank linnaean name pinus abies type picea abies hkarst picea taken correct genus species almost complete consensus pinus abies homotypic synonym picea abies however species considered belong pinus unlikely relationship would reversed picea abies would become homotypic synonym pinus abies homotypic synonym need share epithet name correct name matters shares type example name taraxacum officinale species dandelion type leontodon taraxacum latter homotypic synonym taraxacum officinale fhwigg
heterotypic taxonomic synonyms sometimes indicated different types botanists split common dandelion many quite restricted species name species type common dandelion regarded including small species names species heterotypic synonyms taraxacum officinale fhwigg reducing taxon heterotypic synonym termed sink synonymy synonym

botany although synonym must formally accepted scientific name validly published name listing synonyms synonymy often contains designations reason make formal name manuscript names even misidentifications although usual practice list misidentifications separately11

usageedit
traditional concept synonymy often expanded taxonomic literature include parte part synonyms caused splits circumscriptional changes usually indicated abbreviation pp13 example

dandy described galium tricornutum cited tricorne stokes 1787 parte synonym explicitly excluded type specimen tricorne species tricornutum thus tricorne subdivided
angiosperm phylogeny groups summary plant classification states family verbenaceae much reduced compared decade many genera placed lamiaceae avicennia included verbenaceae moved acanthaceae thus could said verbenaceae parte synonym acanthaceae verbenaceae parte also synonym lamiaceae however terminology rarely used clearer reserve term parte situations divide taxon includes type
