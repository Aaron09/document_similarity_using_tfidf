etymology definitionsedit
word omnivore derives latin omnis vora vorare devour coined french later adopted english 1800s16 traditionally definition omnivory entirely behavioral means simply including animal vegetable tissue diet17 recent times advent advanced technological capabilities fields like gastroenterology biologists formulated standardized variation omnivore used labeling species actual ability obtain energy nutrients materials1819 subsequently conditioned context specific definitions

behavioral definition used specify species individual actively consuming plant animal materials19202122 vegans participate omnivore based diet
physiological definition often used academia specify species capability obtain energy nutrients plant animal matter4182324 humans omnivores capability obtain energy nutrients plant animal materials

taxonomic utility omnivores traditional behavioral definition limited since diet behavior phylogeny omnivorous species might different another instance omnivorous digging roots scavenging fruit carrion taxonomically ecologically quite distinct omnivorous chameleon eats leaves insects term omnivory also always comprehensive deal mineral foods salt licks consumption plant animal material medical purposes would otherwise consumed zoopharmacognosy within nonomnivores
classification contradictions difficultiesedit
though carnivora taxon species classification equivalent exists omnivores omnivores widespread across multiple taxonomic clades carnivora order include carnivorous species species within carnivora taxon carnivorous25 common find physiological carnivores consuming materials plants physiological herbivores consuming material animals felines eating grass deer eating birds2627 behavioral aspect would make omnivores physiological standpoint zoopharmacognosy physiologically animals must able obtain energy nutrients plant animal materials considered omnivorous thus animals still able classified carnivores herbivores obtaining nutrients materials originating sources seemingly complement classification instance well documented animals giraffes camels cattle gnaw bones preferably bones particular minerals nutrients28 felines usually regarded obligate carnivores occasionally grass regurgitate indigestibles hair bones hemoglobin production laxative29
occasionally found animals historically classified carnivorous deliberately plant material example 2013 considered american alligators alligator mississippiensis physiologically omnivorous investigations conducted occasionally fruits suggested alligators probably fruits accidentally also deliberately30
lifehistory omnivores specialized classification given organisms change eating habits life cycle31 species grazing waterfowl like geese known mainly animal tissue stage lives plant matter another32 true many insects beetles family meloidae33 begin eating animal tissue larvae change eating plant matter mature likewise many mosquito species early life plants assorted detritus mature males continue plant matter nectar whereas females anopheles aedes culex also blood reproduce effectively34

bear species omnivores


bear species omnivores44 individual diets range almost exclusively herbivorous almost exclusively carnivorous depending food sources available locally seasonally polar bears classified carnivores taxonomically order carnivora behaviorally subsist largely carnivorous diet depending species bear generally preference class food plants animals digested differently wolf subspecies including wolves dogs dingoes coyotes general preference evolutionarily geared towards meat also voluntarily plant material like fruits vegetables grasses live indefinitely45 also maned wolf canid whose diet naturally plant matter
mammals display omnivorous behavior patterns depending conditions supply culture season generally prefer particular class food digestive processes adapted like arboreal species squirrels primarily granivores subsisting nuts seeds46 like virtually mammals squirrels avidly consume animal food becomes available example american eastern gray squirrel introduced humans parts britain continental europe south africa flourishes effect populations nesting birds often serious largely consumption eggs nestlings4748
speciesedit
various birds omnivorous diets varying berries nectar insects worms fish small rodents examples include cassowaries chickens crows49 related corvids keas rallidae rheas addition lizards turtles fish piranhas catfish invertebrates also omnivorous
quite often mainly herbivorous creatures eagerly small quantities animal food becomes available although trivial time omnivorous herbivorous birds sparrows often feed chicks insects food needed growth50 close inspection appears nectarfeeding birds sunbirds rely ants insects find flowers richer supply protein essential nutrients cyanocobalamin absent nectar similarly monkeys many species maggoty fruit sometimes clear preference sound fruit51 refer animals omnivorous otherwise question context emphasis rather definition
