scientific understanding color scienceedit
light perceived human visual system white incoming light stimulates three types color sensitive cone cells roughly equal amounts23 materials emit light appear white surfaces reflect back light strikes diffuse
white lightedit
1666 isaac newton demonstrated white light could broken composite colors passing prism using second prism reassemble newton scientists believed white fundamental color light
white light generated stars earthbound sources fluorescent lamps white leds incandescent bulbs screen color television computer white produced mixing primary colors light green blue full intensity process called additive mixing image white light fabricated using light wavelengths instance mixing light cyan laser yellow blue lasers light however practical applications since color rendering objects greatly distorted
fact light sources vastly different spectral power distributions result similar sensory experience light processed visual system color arise different spectral power distributions called metamerism







color model used create colors computer screens white made mixing blue green light full intensity









white light refracted prism revealing color components




many light sources emit white light emit light almost visible wavelengths light incandescent lamps various color temperatures notion white light defined mixture colors visible wavelengths2425 widespread idea misconceptioncitation needed might originally stem fact newton discovered sunlight composed light wavelengths across visible spectrum concluding since colors produce white light white must made colors common logical error called affirming consequent might cause misunderstanding
range spectral distributions light sources perceived white—there single unique specification white light example white light bulb might labeled 2700k 6000k produce light different spectral distributions prevent identifying color objects illuminate26
white objectsedit
color vision allows distinguish different objects color order color constancy keep perceived color object relatively unchanged illumination changes among various broad whitish spectral distributions light26
principle used photography cinematography choice white point determines transformation color stimuli changes manipulation white point used explain optical illusions dress
single unique specification white light indeed unique specification white object specifically white surface perfectly white surface diffusely reflects scatters visible light strikes without absorbing irrespective lights wavelength spectral distribution2728 since absorb incident light white lightest possible color reflection diffuse rather specular describes mirror rather white surface2927
reflection incident light wavelengths form uniform reflectance white achromatic color meaning color without hue3031 color stimulus produced perfect diffuser usually considered achromatic stimulus illuminants except whose light sources appear highly chromatic32
color constancy achieved chromatic adaptation international commission illumination defines white adapted color stimulus observer chromatically adapted viewing environment would judge perfectly achromatic luminance factor unity color stimulus considered adapted white different different locations within scene33

bleach bleachingedit
bleaching process whitening fabrics practiced thousands years sometimes simply matter leaving fabric faded bright light 18th century several scientists developed varieties chlorine bleach including sodium hypochlorite calcium hypochlorite bleaching powder41 bleaching agents contain chlorine often based peroxides hydrogen peroxide sodium percarbonate sodium perborate bleaches oxidizing agents fewer number reducing agents sodium dithionite
bleaches attack chromophores part molecule absorbs light causes fabrics different colors oxidizing bleach works breaking chemical bonds make chromophore changes molecule different substance either contain chromophore contains chromophore absorb visible light reducing bleach works converting double bonds chromophore single bonds eliminates ability chromophore absorb visible light42
sunlight acts bleach similar process high energy photons light often violet ultraviolet range disrupt bonds chromophore rendering resulting substance colorless43
detergents step contain fluorescent chemicals glow making fabric look literally whiter white44
