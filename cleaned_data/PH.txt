pure water neutral acid dissolved water less base alkali dissolved water greater solution strong acid hydrochloric acid concentration dm−3 solution strong alkali sodium hydroxide concentration dm−3 thus measured values mostly range though negative values values entirely possible since logarithmic scale difference unit equivalent tenfold difference hydrogen concentration
