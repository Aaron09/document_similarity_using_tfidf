turbocharging versus superchargingedit
main article supercharger
contrast turbochargers superchargers mechanically driven engine11 belts chains shafts gears common methods powering supercharger placing mechanical load engine1213 example singlestage singlespeed supercharged rollsroyce merlin engine supercharger uses horsepower kilowatts benefits outweigh costs drive supercharger engine generates additional 400horsepower gain principal disadvantage supercharger becomes apparent engine must withstand power output engine plus power drive supercharger
another disadvantage superchargers lower adiabatic efficiency compared turbochargers especially rootstype superchargers adiabatic efficiency measure compressors ability compress without adding excess heat even ideal conditions compression process always results elevated output temperature however efficient compressors produce less excess heat roots superchargers impart significantly heat turbochargers thus given volume pressure turbocharged cooler result denser containing oxygen molecules therefore potential power supercharged practical application disparity dramatic turbochargers often producing power based solely differences adiabatic efficiency however heat transfer exhaust considerable heating occur
comparison turbocharger place direct mechanical load engine although turbochargers place exhaust back pressure engines increasing pumping losses11 efficient increased back pressure taxes piston exhaust stroke much energy driving turbine provided stillexpanding exhaust would otherwise wasted heat tailpipe contrast supercharging primary disadvantage turbocharging referred spool time time demand increase power throttle opened turbochargers providing increased intake pressure hence increased power
throttle occurs turbochargers rely buildup exhaust pressure drive turbine variable output systems automobile engines exhaust pressure idle engine speeds throttle usually insufficient drive turbine engine reaches sufficient speed turbine section start spool spin fast enough produce intake pressure atmospheric pressure
