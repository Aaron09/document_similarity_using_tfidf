historyedit
demographic thoughts traced back antiquity present many civilisations cultures like ancient greece ancient rome india china5 ancient greece found writings herodotus thucidides hippocrates epicurus protagoras polus plato aristotle5 rome writers philosophers like cicero seneca pliny elder marcus aurelius epictetus cato collumella also expressed important ideas ground5
middle ages christian thinkers devoted much time refuting classical ideas demography important contributors field william conches6 bartholomew lucca6 william auvergne6 william pagula6 khaldun7
earliest demographic studies modern period natural political observations made upon bills mortality 1662 john graunt contains primitive form life table among studys findings third children london died sixteenth birthday mathematicians edmond halley developed life table basis life insurance mathematics richard price credited first textbook life contingencies published 17718 followed later augustus morgan application probabilities life contingencies’ 18389
18th century thomas robert malthus concluded unchecked populations would subject exponential growth feared population growth would tend outstrip growth food production leading everincreasing famine poverty malthusian catastrophe seen intellectual father ideas overpopulation limits growth later sophisticated realistic models presented benjamin gompertz verhulst
period 18601910 characterised period transition wherein demography emerged statistics separate field interest period included panoply international ‘great demographers’ like adolphe quételet 1796–1874 william farr 1807–1883 louisadolphe bertillon 1821–1883 jacques 1851–1922 joseph körösi 1844–1906 anders nicolas kaier 1838–1919 richard böckh 1824–1907 émile durkheim 18581917 wilhelm lexis 1837–1914 luigi bodio 1840–1920 contributed development demography toolkit methods techniques demographic analysis10
methodsedit
types data collection—direct indirect—with several different methods type
direct methodsedit
direct data comes vital statistics registries track births deaths well certain changes legal status marriage divorce migration registration place residence developed countries good registration systems united states much europe registry statistics best method estimating number births deaths
census common direct method collecting demographic data census usually conducted national government attempts enumerate every person country however contrast vital statistics data typically collected continuously summarized annual basis censuses typically occur every years thus usually best source data births deaths analyses conducted census estimate much undercounting took place compare ratios census data estimated natural values mortality data
censuses count people typically collect information families households addition individual characteristics marital status literacyeducation employment status occupation geographical location also collect data migration place birth previous residence language religion nationality ethnicity race citizenship countries vital registration system incomplete censuses also used direct source information fertility mortality example censuses peoples republic china gather information births deaths occurred months immediately preceding census

indirect methodsedit
indirect methods collecting data required countries periods full data available case much developing world historical demography techniques contemporary demography sister method survey researchers women many sisters died children surveys researchers indirectly estimate birth death rates entire population indirect methods contemporary demography include asking people siblings parents children indirect methods necessary historical demography

common rates ratiosedit

crude birth rate annual number live births 1000 people
general fertility rate annual number live births 1000 women childbearing often taken years sometimes
agespecific fertility rates annual number live births 1000 women particular groups usually 1519 2024
crude death rate annual number deaths 1000 people
infant mortality rate annual number deaths children less year 1000 live births
expectation life life expectancy number years individual given could expect live present mortality levels
total fertility rate number live births woman completing reproductive life childbearing reflected current agespecific fertility rates
replacement level fertility average number children women must order replace population next generation example replacement level fertility 21114
gross reproduction rate number daughters would born woman completing reproductive life current agespecific fertility rates
reproduction ratio expected number daughters newborn prospective mother survive ages childbearing
stable population constant crude birth death rates long period time percentage people every class remains constant equivalently population pyramid unchanging structure14
stationary population stable unchanging size difference crude birth rate crude death rate zero14

stable population necessarily remain fixed size expanding shrinking14
note crude death rate defined applied whole population give misleading impression example number deaths 1000 people higher developed nations lessdeveloped countries despite standards health better developed countries developed countries proportionally older people likely given year overall mortality rate higher even mortality rate given lower complete picture mortality given life table summarizes mortality separately life table necessary give good estimate life expectancy

populations change three processes fertility mortality migration fertility involves number children women contrasted fecundity womans childbearing potential17 mortality study causes consequences measurement processes affecting death members population demographers commonly study mortality using life table statistical device provides information mortality conditions notably life expectancy population18
migration refers movement persons locality origin destination place across predefined political boundary migration researchers designate movements migrations unless somewhat permanent thus demographers consider tourists travellers migrating demographers study migration typically census data place residence indirect sources data including forms labour force surveys also important19
