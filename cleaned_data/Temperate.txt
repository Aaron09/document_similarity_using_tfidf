climate classifications temperate zone often divided several smaller climate zones based latitude include humid subtropical climate mediterranean climate oceanic continental climate
subtropical climates generally located 235° 350° north south latitude eastern leeward sides landmasses climate long generally summers short mild winters annual rainfall often concentrated warmest part year climates occur southern asia southeastern united states parts eastern australia eastern coastal south america
mediterranean climates occur generally north south latitude western sides landmasses climate long summers short mild winters however seasonal rainfall opposite subtropical humid type winter cool season rainfall peak typical climates occur near rimlands mediterranean western australia california southernmost areas south africa
oceanic climates occur higher middle latitudes north south latitude created onshore flow cool high latitude oceans west causes climate cool summers cool cold winters climates frequently cloudy annual rainfall spread throughout entire year regions climate include western europe northwestern north america parts zealand
continental climates occur middle latitudes climates normally inland leeward sides landmasses feature warm summers cold winters large interseasonal temperature variation regions climate include northern temperate asia northern united states southern canada parts northeastern europe
vast majority worlds human population resides temperate zones especially northern hemisphere greater mass land6 richest temperate flora world found southern africa 24000 taxa species infraspecific taxa described7
agricultureedit
farming largescale practice temperate regions plentiful rainfall warm summers agricultural activity occurs spring summer cold winters small effect agricultural production extreme winters summers huge impact productivity agriculture8
urbanizationedit
temperate regions majority worlds population leads large cities couple factors climate large city landscapes differs climate rural areas factor strength absorption rate builds asphalt higher natural land large factor burning fossil fuels buildings vehicles factors average climate cities warmer surrounding areas8
