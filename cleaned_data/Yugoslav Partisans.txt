partisans staged guerrilla campaign enjoyed gradually increased levels success support general populace succeeded controlling large chunks yugoslav territory managed peoples committees organized civilian governments areas country controlled communists even limited arms industries beginning partisan forces relatively small poorly armed without infrastructure major advantages military paramilitary formations former yugoslavia

small valuable cadre spanish civil veterans unlike anyone else time experience modern fought circumstances quite similar world yugoslavia
founded ideology rather ethnicity meant partisans could expect least levels support corner country unlike paramilitary formations whose support limited territories croat serb majorities allowed units mobile fill ranks larger pool potential recruits

occupying quisling forces however quite aware partisan threat attempted destroy resistance yugoslav historiographers defined seven major enemy offensives

first enemy offensive attack conducted axis autumn 1941 republic užice liberated territory partisans established western serbia november 1941 german troops attacked reoccupied territory majority partisan forces escaping towards bosnia39 offensive tenuous collaboration partisans royalist chetnik movement broke turned open hostility40
second enemy offensive coordinated axis attack conducted january 1942 partisan forces eastern bosnia partisan troops avoided encirclement forced retreat igman mountain near sarajevo41

fourth enemy offensive republic bihać also known battle neretva fall weiss case white conflict spanning area western bosnia northern herzegovina culminating partisan retreat neretva river took place january april 194343

sixth enemy offensive series operations undertaken wehrmacht ustaše capitulation italy attempt secure adriatic coast took place late 1943 early 1944
seventh enemy offensive final attack western bosnia second quarter 1944 included operation rösselsprung knights leap unsuccessful attempt eliminate tito annihilate leadership partisan movement


nature partisan resistance operations must either eliminate altogether leave potentially stronger shown sequel previous five offensives another partisan brigades divisions emerged stronger experience armament backing population come alternative resistance death imprisonment starvation could halfmeasures germans left nothing behind trail ruin circumstances might possibly remained purely ideological reactionaries abroad said german propaganda utmost support became national preservation clear room left provincialism serbs croats slovenes macedonians bosnians christian moslem orthodox catholic sank differences sheer desperation striving remain alive44
