compiler implements formal transformation highlevel source program lowlevel target program compiler design define solution tackle defined subset interfaces compilation tools preprocessors assemblers linkers design requirements include rigorously defined interfaces internally compiler components externally supporting toolsets
early days approach taken compiler design directly affected complexity computer language processed experience persons designing resources available resource limitations need pass source code
compiler relatively simple language written person might single monolithic piece software however source language grows complexity design split number interdependent phases separate phases provide design improvements focus development functions compilation process
onepass versus multipass compilersedit
classifying compilers number passes background hardware resource limitations computers compiling involves performing lots work early computers enough memory contain program work compilers split smaller programs made pass source representation performing required analysis translations
ability compile single pass classically seen benefit simplifies writing compiler onepass compilers generally perform compilations faster multipass compilers thus partly driven resource limitations early systems many early languages specifically designed could compiled single pass pascal
cases design language feature require compiler perform pass source instance consider declaration appearing line source affects translation statement appearing line case first pass needs gather information declarations appearing statements affect actual translation happening subsequent pass
disadvantage compiling single pass possible perform many sophisticated optimizations needed generate high quality code difficult count exactly many passes optimizing compiler makes instance different phases optimization analyse expression many times analyse another expression
splitting compiler small programs technique used researchers interested producing provably correct compilers proving correctness small programs often requires less effort proving correctness larger single equivalent program

compiler design



regardless exact number phases compiler design phases assigned three stages stages include front middle back

front verifies syntax semantics according specific source language statically typed languages performs type checking collecting type information input program syntactically incorrect type error generates errors warnings highlightingdubious discuss source code aspects front include lexical analysis syntax analysis semantic analysis front transforms input program intermediate representation processing middle usually lowerlevel representation program respect source code
middle performs optimizations independent architecture targeted source codemachine code independence intended enable generic optimizations shared versions compiler supporting different languages target processors examples middle optimizations removal useless dead code elimination unreachable code reachability analysis discovery propagation constant values constant propagation relocation computation less frequently executed place loop specialization computation based context eventually producing optimized used back
back takes optimized middle perform analysis transformations optimizations specific target architecture back generates targetdependent assembly code performing register allocation process back performs instruction scheduling reorders instructions keep parallel execution units busy filling delay slots although algorithms optimization nphard heuristic techniques welldeveloped currently implemented productionquality compilers typically output back machine code specialized particular processor operating system

lexer parser example starting sequence characters ifnet00totalnet10tax1000 scanner composes sequence tokens categorizes example identifier reserved word number literal operator latter sequence transformed parser syntax tree treated remaining compiler phases scanner parser handles regular properly contextfree parts grammar respectively


front analyzes source code build internal representation program called intermediate representation also manages symbol table data structure mapping symbol source code associated information location type scope
frontend single monolithic function program scannerless parser commonly implemented analyzed several phases execute sequentially concurrently method favored modularity separation concerns commonly today frontend broken three phases lexical analysis also known lexing syntax analysis also known scanning parsing semantic analysis lexing parsing comprise syntactic analysis word syntax phrase syntax respectively simple cases modules lexer parser automatically generated grammar language though complex cases require manual modification lexical grammar phrase grammar usually contextfree grammars simplifies analysis significantly contextsensitivity handled semantic analysis phase semantic analysis phase generally complex written hand partially fully automated using attribute grammars phases broken lexing scanning evaluating parsing building concrete syntax tree parse tree transforming abstract syntax tree syntax tree cases additional phases used notably line reconstruction preprocessing rare
main phases front include following

line reconstruction converts input character sequence canonical form ready parser languages strop keywords allow arbitrary spaces within identifiers require phase topdown recursivedescent tabledriven parsers used 1960s typically read source character time require separate tokenizing phase atlas autocode implementations algol coral examples stropped languages compilers would line reconstruction phase
preprocessing supports macro substitution conditional compilation typically preprocessing phase occurs syntactic semantic analysis case preprocessor manipulates lexical tokens rather syntactic forms however languages scheme support macro substitutions based syntactic forms
lexical analysis also known lexing tokenization breaks source code text sequence small pieces called lexical tokens38 phase divided stages scanning segments input text syntactic units called lexemes assign category evaluating converts lexemes processed value token pair consisting token name optional token value39 common token categories include identifiers keywords separators operators literals comments although token categories varies different programming languages lexeme syntax typically regular language finite state automaton constructed regular expression used recognize software lexical analysis called lexical analyzer separate step—it combined parsing step scannerless parsing case parsing done character level token level
syntax analysis also known parsing involves parsing token sequence identify syntactic structure program phase typically builds parse tree replaces linear sequence tokens tree structure built according rules formal grammar define languages syntax parse tree often analyzed augmented transformed later phases compiler40
semantic analysis adds semantic information parse tree builds symbol table phase performs semantic checks type checking checking type errors object binding associating variable function references definitions definite assignment requiring local variables initialized rejecting incorrect programs issuing warnings semantic analysis usually requires complete parse tree meaning phase logically follows parsing phase logically precedes code generation phase though often possible fold multiple phases pass code compiler implementation

middle endedit
middle performs optimizations intermediate representation order improve performance quality produced machine code41 middle contains optimizations independent architecture targeted
main phases middle include following

analysis gathering program information intermediate representation derived input dataflow analysis used build usedefine chains together dependence analysis alias analysis pointer analysis escape analysis accurate analysis basis compiler optimization control flow graph every compiled function call graph program usually also built analysis phase
optimization intermediate language representation transformed functionally equivalent faster smaller forms popular optimizations inline expansion dead code elimination constant propagation loop transformation even automatic parallelization

compiler analysis prerequisite compiler optimization tightly work together example dependence analysis crucial loop transformation
scope compiler analysis optimizations vary greatly small basic block procedurefunction level even whole program interprocedural optimization obviouslyclarification needed compiler potentially better using broader view broad view free large scope analysis optimizations costly terms compilation time memory space especially true interprocedural analysis optimizations
interprocedural analysis optimizations common modern commercial compilers intel microsoft microsystems open source criticized long time lacking powerful interprocedural optimizations changing respect another open source compiler full analysis optimization infrastructure open64 used many organizations research commercial purposes
extra time space needed compiler analysis optimizations compilers skip default users compilation options explicitly tell compiler optimizations enabled
back endedit
back responsible architecture specific optimizations code generation
main phases back include following

machine dependent optimizations optimizations depend details architecture compiler targets42 prominent example peephole optimizations rewrites short sequences assembler instructions efficient instructions
code generation transformed intermediate language translated output language usually native machine language system involves resource storage decisions deciding variables registers memory selection scheduling appropriate machine instructions along associated addressing modes also sethiullman algorithm debug data also need generated facilitate debugging

compiled versus interpreted languagesedit
higherlevel programming languages usually appear type translation mind either designed compiled language interpreted language however practice rarely anything language requires exclusively compiled exclusively interpreted although possible design languages rely reinterpretation time categorization usually reflects popular widespread implementations language instance basic sometimes called interpreted language compiled despite existence basic compilers interpreters
interpretation replace compilation completely hides user makes gradual even though interpreter interpreted directly executed program needed somewhere bottom stack machine language
compilers contain interpreters optimization reasons example expression executed compilation results inserted output program prevents recalculated time program runs greatly speed final program modern trends toward justintime compilation bytecode interpretation times blur traditional categorizations compilers interpreters even
language specifications spell implementations must include compilation facility example common lisp however nothing inherent definition common lisp stops interpreted languages features easy implement interpreter make writing compiler much harder example snobol4 many scripting languages allow programs construct arbitrary source code runtime regular string operations execute code passing special evaluation function implement features compiled language programs must usually shipped runtime library includes version compiler
