history




moon nuremberg chronicle 1493


many methods used simulate mean solar time earliest clepsydras water clocks used almost four millennia early middle millennium early millennium middle millennium water clocks adjusted agree apparent solar thus better shadow cast gnomon vertical pole except could used night
long known moves eastward relative fixed stars along ecliptic since middle first millennium diurnal rotation fixed stars used determine mean solar time clocks compared determine error rate babylonian astronomers knew equation time correcting well different rotation rate stars sidereal time obtain mean solar time much accurate water clocks ideal mean solar time used ever since describe motions planets moon
mechanical clocks achieve accuracy earths star clock beginning 20th century todays atomic clocks much constant rate earth star clock still used determine mean solar time since sometime late 20th century earths rotation defined relative ensemble extragalactic radio sources converted mean solar time adopted ratio difference calculated mean solar time coordinated universal time determines whether leap second needed time scale runs seconds second adopted already little shorter current value second mean solar time15
