rationaleedit
football highcontact sport requiring balance offense defense many rules exist regulate equality safety contact actions players team difficult always avoid violating rules without giving much advantage4 thus elaborate system fouls penalties developed punishment crime maintain balance following rules keeping good flow game players coaches constantly looking ways find advantage stretches limitations imposed rules example 20176 baltimore ravens offensive linemen commit holding penalties order allow punter keep possession ball time would expire sense game offensive penalties however changed rules prevent teams manipulating game clock frequency severity fouls make large difference outcome game well coaches constantly looking ways minimize number severity infractions committed players
common misconception term penalty used refer infraction penal consequence infraction foul rule infraction offensive holding penalty move back yards prescribed5
signaling announcing penaltiesedit
officials initially signal fouls tossing bright yellow colored flag onto field toward spot foul broadcasters fans often terms flag flag play refer fouls game
play multiple officials flag play multiple flags thrown separate fouls play applicable official signal additional fouls given play throwing beanbag officials throw flag play stop ball becomes dead normal conditions fouls
ball dead immediately foul called play prior snap since ball dead anyway referee officials threw flags officials view play confer come consensus whether infraction actually committed committed final determination assessment penalty sole responsibility referee6 referee makes initial visual body signals press indicating fouls committed team committed latter shown extending toward teams zone7
referee confers offended teams onfield captain find whether offended team would rather decline penalty take result play8 certain situations result play advantageous offended team especially example time running half 7yard gain better option 5yard penalty however certain scenarios referee confer team captain enforcement cannot declined false start foul penalties called prior snap choice fairly obvious defense commits foul play offense scores touchdown
9after final conference referee makes full visual signals describing foul detail consisting foul committed team committed whether opposing team chooses decline resulting possession college football professional leagues high school games referee also announces fouls penalties wireless microphone members teams crowds stands viewerslisteners televisedradio broadcast game college professional football referee also give numbers players committed fouls announcements microphone referee usually names respective teams cities however canadian football league announced respective city province rather generic terms offense defense kicking team receiving team officials refer teams jersey color white blue
general types penalty enforcementedit
following general types penalty enforcement specific rules vary depending league conference andor level football
penalties result replaying moving ball toward offending teams zone distance usually either yards depending penalty however penalties enforced capped half distance offending teams goal line10
depending foul spot penalty enforced spot foul previous spot line scrimmage began spot snap fumble backwards pass succeeding spot line scrimmage next down11
defensive penalties give offense automatic first conversely offensive penalties result loss loss right repeat penalty gives offensive team enough yardage gain first first usual
rules asymmetrical regard whether team score directly result penalty offensive team cannot foul penalized spot foul called defense zone ball placed either oneyard line twoyard line offense must score however penalties called offense zone result defense scoring twopoint safety
defense commits foul last play quarter offense usually option accept penalty replay even clock showing 0000 untimed play conversely cases offense commits foul last play half play foul committed usually nullified half ends
multiple fouls occur teams commit foul play regardless severity fouls usually offset replayed however fouls must committed time frame instance fouls active play offset foul play personal foul whistle personal fouls play offset although often called major yard penalty team offset minor yard penalty team12 penalty yardage generally netted 15yard penalty team 10yard penalty result yards penalty enforcement
intentional foulsedit
certain situations team specifically intentionally commit foul order receive penalty advantageous13

delay game penalty sought intentionally order back line scrimmage prior punt allow larger punting field
defensive pass interference committed near zone toward game order prevent touchdown would place ball near goal line first give defense team slightly ahead chance prevent touchdown would opponent ahead leagues considered instituting palpably unfair calls situations calling touchdowns prevent occurring
since penalty stop clock team commit foul order stop clock timeouts available leagues instituted 10second runoff order negate ability

tensecond runoff ruleedit
ncaa 10second runoff assessed following acts committed offense last minute either half 2017 twominute warning nfl14

foul either team prevents ball snapped
intentional grounding
illegal forward pass beyond line scrimmage
throwing backwards pass bounds
intentional causes clock stop

10second penalty apply

clock stopped ball play start ball snapped
team offense timeouts elects lieu runoff
defense declines runoff prevents offense committing fouls intentionally clock note team defense elect decline runoff accepting yardage penalty reverse

moreover game clock ball placed runoff occurs seconds less remaining half automatically ends since enforcement 10second runoff eight regular season games ended automatically rule 2005 arizonast louis 2009 cincinnatigreen 2011 chicagooakland 2012 washingtonphiladelphia 2012 englandarizona cost england chance attempt field goal half game eventually lost points 2014 louistampa cost tampa chance attempt gamewinning field goal 2015 englandnew york jets cost jets attempt throw hail mary force game overtime 2017 atlantadetroit cost lions chance game preseason game 2006 houston kansas city first half automatically intentional grounding foul less seconds left 2013 divisional playoff game orleans saints seattle seahawks also ended 10second runoff saints wide receiver marques colston threw illegal forward pass
starting 2011 ncaa adopted similar 10second penalty rule college football like rule applies last minute half ncaa rule differs applies fouls either side cause clock stoppage like rule team benefits penalty elect take yardage runoff yardage alone neither runoff lieu yards penalized team elect take charged timeout order avoid runoff15
ncaa rule passed response quarter 2010 music city bowl game north carolina heels 2017 quarter timeouts spiked ball stop clock second left many field confusion whether field goal unit needed come field college football 10second runoff penalized yards still able kick field goal send game overtime would wind beating tennessee 3027 double overtime ironically rule would saved tennessee heels foul came snap would triggered runoff
