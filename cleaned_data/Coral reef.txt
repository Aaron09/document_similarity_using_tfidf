coral reefs today formed last glacial period melting caused level rise flood continental shelves means modern coral reefs less 10000 years communities established shelves reefs grew upwards pacing rising levels reefs rose slowly could become drowned reefs covered much water insufficient light12 coral reefs found deep away continental shelves around oceanic islands atolls vast majority islands volcanic origin exceptions tectonic origins plate movements lifted deep ocean floor surface
1842 first monograph structure distribution coral reefs13 charles darwin theory formation atoll reefs idea conceived voyage beagle theorized uplift subsidence earths crust oceans formed atolls14 darwin’s theory sets sequence three stages atoll formation starts fringing reef forming around extinct volcanic island island ocean floor subsides subsidence continues fringing reef becomes barrier reef ultimately atoll reef







darwin’s theory starts volcanic island becomes extinct









island ocean floor subside coral growth builds fringing reef often including shallow lagoon land main reef









subsidence continues fringing reef becomes larger barrier reef shore bigger deeper lagoon inside









ultimately island sinks barrier reef becomes atoll enclosing open lagoon




darwin predicted underneath lagoon would rock base remains original volcano subsequent drilling proved correct darwins theory followed understanding coral polyps thrive clean seas tropics water agitated live within limited depth range starting tide level underlying earth allows corals grow around coast form called fringing reefs eventually grow shore become barrier reef




fringing reef take thousand years form atoll take million years15

three major zones coral reef fore reef reef crest back reef


coral reef ecosystems contain distinct zones represent different kinds habitats usually three major zones recognized fore reef reef crest back reef frequently referred reef lagoon
three zones physically ecologically interconnected reef life oceanic processes create opportunities exchange seawater sediments nutrients marine life among another
thus integrated components coral reef ecosystem playing role support reefs abundant diverse fish assemblages
coral reefs exist shallow waters less deep inhabit tropical continental shelves cool nutrient rich upwelling occur great barrier reef others found deep ocean surrounding islands atolls maldives reefs surrounding islands form islands subside ocean atolls form island subsides surface
