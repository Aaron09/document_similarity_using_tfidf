physical weathering
physical weathering also called mechanical weathering disaggregation class processes causes disintegration rocks without chemical change primary process physical weathering abrasion process clasts particles reduced size however chemical physical weathering often hand hand physical weathering occur temperature pressure frost example cracks exploited physical weathering increase surface area exposed chemical action thus amplifying rate disintegration
abrasion water wind processes loaded sediment tremendous cutting power amply demonstrated gorges ravines valleys around world glacial areas huge moving masses embedded soil rock fragments grind rocks path carry away large volumes material plant roots sometimes enter cracks rocks apart resulting disintegration burrowing animals help disintegrate rock however biotic influences usually little importance producing parent material compared drastic physical effects water wind temperature change
thermal stress
thermal stress weathering sometimes called insolation weathering2 results expansion contraction rock caused temperature changes example heating rocks sunlight fires cause expansion constituent minerals minerals expand others temperature changes differential stresses eventually cause rock crack apart outer surface rock often warmer colder protected inner portions rocks weather exfoliation peeling away outer layers process sharply accelerated forms surface cracks water freezes expands force 1465 mgm2 disintegrating huge rock masses dislodging mineral grains smaller fragments
thermal stress weathering comprises main types thermal shock thermal fatigue thermal stress weathering important mechanism deserts large diurnal temperature range cold night3 repeated heating cooling exerts stress outer layers rocks cause outer layers peel thin sheets process peeling also called exfoliation although temperature changes principal driver moisture enhance thermal expansion rock forest fires range fires also known cause significant weathering rocks boulders exposed along ground surface intense localized heat rapidly expand boulder
thermal heat wildfire cause significant weathering rocks boulders heat rapidly expand boulder thermal shock occur differential expansion thermal gradient understood terms stress strain equivalently point stress exceed strength material causing crack form nothing stops crack propagating material result objects structure fail

frost weathering frost wedging wedging cryofracturing collective name several processes present processes include frost shattering frostwedging freeze–thaw weathering severe frost shattering produces huge piles rock fragments called scree located foot mountain areas along slopes frost weathering common mountain areas temperature around freezing point water certain frostsusceptible soils expand heave upon freezing result water migrating capillary action grow lenses near freezing front4 phenomenon occurs within pore spaces rocks accumulations grow larger attract liquid water surrounding pores crystal growth weakens rocks time break caused approximately expansion water freezes place considerable stress anything containing water freezes
freeze induced weathering action occurs mainly environments moisture temperatures frequently fluctuate freezing point especially alpine periglacial areas example rocks susceptible frost action chalk many pore spaces growth crystals process seen dartmoor results formation tors water entered joints freezes formed strains walls joints causes joints deepen widen thaws water flow rock repeated freeze–thaw cycles weaken rocks time break along joints angular pieces angular rock fragments gather foot slope form talus slope scree slope splitting rocks along joints blocks called block disintegration blocks rocks detached various shapes depending rock structure
ocean waves




wave action water chemistry lead structural failure exposed rocks


coastal geography formed weathering wave actions geological times happen abruptly process salt weathering
pressure release
also erosion tectonics




pressure release could caused exfoliated granite sheets shown picture


pressure release also known unloading overlying materials necessarily rocks removed erosion processes causes underlying rocks expand fracture parallel surface
intrusive igneous rocks granite formed deep beneath earths surface tremendous pressure overlying rock material erosion removes overlying rock material intrusive rocks exposed pressure released outer parts rocks tend expand expansion sets stresses cause fractures parallel rock surface form time sheets rock break away exposed rocks along fractures process known exfoliation exfoliation pressure release also known sheeting
retreat overlying glacier also lead exfoliation pressure release
saltcrystal growth




tafoni salt point state park sonoma county california


salt crystallization otherwise known haloclasty causes disintegration rocks saline solutions seep cracks joints rocks evaporate leaving salt crystals behind salt crystals expand heated exerting pressure confining rock
salt crystallization also take place solutions decompose rocks example limestone chalk form salt solutions sodium sulfate sodium carbonate moisture evaporates form respective salt crystals
salts proved effective disintegrating rocks sodium sulfate magnesium sulfate calcium chloride salts expand three times even
normally associated arid climates strong heating causes strong evaporation therefore salt crystallization also common along coasts example salt weathering seen honeycombed stones wall honeycomb type tafoni class cavernous rock weathering structures likely develop large part chemical physical salt weathering processes
