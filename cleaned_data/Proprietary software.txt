software becoming proprietaryedit
late 1960s computers—large expensive mainframe computers machines specially airconditioned computer rooms—were leased customers rather sold34 service software available usually supplied manufacturers without separate charge 1969citation needed computer vendors usually provided source code installed software customerscitation needed customers developed software often made available others without charge5 closed source means computer programs whose source code published available edited organization developed
1969 antitrust lawsuits pending industry change starting charge separately mainframe software67page needed services unbundling hardware software8
bill gates open letter hobbyists 1976 decried computer hobbyists rampant copyright infringement software particularly microsofts altair basic interpreter reminded audience theft programmers hindered ability produce quality software9
according brewster kahle legal characteristic software changed also copyright 197610
starting february 1983 adopted objectcodeonly model growing list software stopped shipping source code1112
1983 binary software became also copyrightable united states apple franklin decision13 source code copyrightable14 additionally growing availability millions computers based microprocessor architecture created first time unfragmented enough market binary distributed software14
legal basisedit
information software software copyright software patent enduser license agreement
software covered copyright along contract patents trade secrets provides legal basis owner establish exclusive rights15
software vendor delineates specific terms enduser license agreement eula user agree contract writing interactively screen clickwrap opening containing software shrink wrap licensing license agreements usually negotiable16 software patents grant exclusive rights algorithms software features patentable subject matter coverage varying jurisdiction vendors sometimes grant patent rights user license agreement17 source code piece software routinely handled trade secret18 occasionally software made available fewer restrictions licensing sourcecode access software known free opensource19
limitationsedit
license agreements override applicable copyright contract provisions conflict applicable enforceable20 software specifically licensed sold order avoid limitations copyright firstsale doctrine21
exclusive rightsedit
owner proprietary software exercises certain exclusive rights software owner restrict inspection source code modification source code redistribution
softwareedit
information copy protection damaged good price discrimination
vendors typically limit number computers software used prohibit user installing software extra computerscitation needed restricted sometimes enforced technical measure product activation product serial number hardware copy protection
vendors also distribute versions remove particular features versions allow certain fields endeavor noncommercial educational nonprofit
restrictions vary license

windows vista starter restricted running maximum three concurrent applications
retail edition microsoft office home student 2007 limited noncommercial three devices household
windows installed computer limits number network file sharing connections 1022 home edition disables features present windows professional
traditionally adobe licenses limited user allow user install second copy home computer laptop23 longer true switching creative cloud
iwork apples productivity suite available fiveuser family pack five computers household24

inspection modification source codeedit
also open source antifeatures
vendors typically distribute proprietary software compiled form usually machine language understood computers central processing unit typically retain source code humanreadable version software written higher level programming language25 scheme often referred closed source26
proprietary software distributed without source code vendors distribute source code otherwise make available customers example users purchased license internet forum software vbulletin modify source site cannot redistribute true many applications must source code form server source code covered nondisclosure agreement license allows example study modification redistributioncitation needed textbased email client pine certain implementations secure shell distributed proprietary licenses make source code availablecitation needed
governments fear proprietary software include defects malicious features would compromise sensitive information 2003 microsoft established government security program allow governments view source code microsoft security documentation chinese government early participant2728 program part microsofts broader shared source initiative provides source code access products reference source license msrsl limited public license mslpl proprietary software licenses source code made available
governments also accused adding malware software according documents released edward snowden used covert partnerships software companies make commercial encryption software exploitable eavesdropping insert backdoors2930
software vendors sometimes obfuscated code impede users would reverse engineer softwarecitation needed particularly common certain programming languagescitation needed example bytecode programs written java easily decompiled somewhat usable codecitation needed source code programs written scripting languages javascript available time31
redistributionedit
information shareware
also freely redistributable software
proprietary software vendors prohibit users sharing software others another unique license required another party software
case proprietary software source code available vendor also prohibit customers distributing modifications source code
shareware closedsource software whose owner encourages redistribution cost user sometimes must trial period usually allows single user computer cases software features restricted trial period practice sometimes called crippleware
interoperability software hardwareedit
information interoperability software
proprietary file formats protocolsedit
information proprietary format proprietary protocol
proprietary software oftencitation needed stores data file formats incompatible software also communicate using protocols incompatible formats protocols restricted trade secrets subject patentscitation needed
proprietary apisedit
proprietary application programming interface software library interface specific device likely number devices within particular manufacturers product range32 motivation using proprietary vendor lockin standard apis support devices functionality32
european commission march 2004 decision microsofts business practices33 quotes paragraph microsoft general manager development aaron contorer stating february 1997 internal microsoft memo drafted bill gates

windows broad deep functional isvs would crazy deeply embedded source code many windows apps huge switching cost using different operating system instead

early versions iphone covered nondisclosure agreement agreement forbade independent developers discussing content interfaces apple discontinued october 200834
vendor lockinedit
information vendor lockin
dependency future versions upgrades proprietary software package create vendor lockin entrenching monopoly position35
software limited certain hardware configurationsedit
proprietary software also licensing terms limit usage software specific hardware apple licensing model operating system limited apple hardware licensing various design decisions licensing model affirmed united states court appeals36
abandonment ownersedit
main article abandonware
proprietary software longer marketed supported sold owner called abandonware digital form orphaned works proprietor software package cease exist decide cease limit production support proprietary software package recipients users package recourse problems found software proprietors fail improve support software business problems37 support older existing versions software package ended force users upgrade newer versions38 planned obsolescence sometimes another vendor softwares community provide support software users migrate either competing systems longer support life cycles fossbased systems39
closedsource software released owner endoflife opensource source available software often prevent software becoming unsupported unavailable abandonware404142 realms software famous practice releasing closed source software open source kinds freeofcharge downloads freeware still commercially sold fatalis examples formerly closedsource software list commercial software available source code list commercial video games available source code
formerly opensource softwareedit
also list formerly proprietary software
formerly opensource software made proprietary later sometimes commercialization reasons sometimes security anticheat measurement security obscurity famous example doom source port zdaemon prone aimbot cheaters43
pricing economicsedit
also commercial software
proprietary software synonymous commercial software4445 although terms sometimes used synonymously articles free software4647 proprietary software distributed cost free software distributed cost fee48 difference whether proprietary software distributed would proprietors discretion free software anyone copy decide whether much charge copy related services49
proprietary software comes cost called freeware
proponents commercial proprietary software argue requiring users software product increases funding time available research development software example microsoft says percopy fees maximise profitability software development50
proprietary software generally creates greater commercial activity free software especially regard market revenues51
examplesedit
examples proprietary software include microsoft windows adobe flash player itunes adobe photoshop google earth macos formerly skype winrar oracles version java versions unix
software distributions considered proprietary fact incorporate mixed source model including free nonfree software distribution52 socalled proprietary unix distributions mixed source software bundling opensource components like bind sendmail window system dhcp others along purely proprietary kernel system utilities5354
free software packages also simultaneously available proprietary terms examples include mysql sendmail original copyright holders work free software even copyleft free software duallicensing allow others redistribute proprietary versions noncopyleft free software software distributed permissive free software license released public domain allows anyone make proprietary redistributions5556 free software depends proprietary software considered trapped free software foundation includes software written microsoft windows57 software could java became free software58
