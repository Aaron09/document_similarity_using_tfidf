climateedit
triassic generally trend began late carboniferous highly seasonal especially interior pangaea levels also exacerbated temperature extremes high specific heat capacity water acts temperaturestabilizing heat reservoir land areas near large bodies water—especially oceans—experience less variation temperature much land constituted pangaea distant oceans temperatures fluctuated greatly interior pangaea probably included expansive areas desert abundant beds evaporites halite support conclusions evidence exists generally climate triassic punctuated episodes increased rainfall20 important humid episodes carnian pluvial event rhaetian million years triassic–jurassic extinction event
levels began rise jurassic probably caused increase seafloor spreading formation crust beneath surface displaced ocean waters much today flooded coastal areas furthermore pangaea began rift smaller divisions bringing land area contact ocean forming tethys temperatures continued increase began stabilize humidity also increased proximity water deserts retreated
climate cretaceous less certain widely disputed higher levels carbon dioxide atmosphere thought caused world temperature gradient north south become almost flat temperatures across planet average temperatures also higher today 10°c circulation oxygen deep ocean also disrupted21dubious discuss reason large volumes organic matter unable decompose accumulated eventually deposited black shale

dinosaurs dominant terrestrial vertebrates throughout much mesozoic


extinction nearly animal species permian period allowed radiation many lifeforms particular extinction large herbivorous pareiasaurs carnivorous gorgonopsians left ecological niches empty filled surviving cynodonts dicynodonts latter subsequently became extinct
recent research indicates specialized animals formed complex ecosystems high biodiversity complex food webs variety niches took much longer reestablish recovery begin start midtriassic years extinction31 complete years permian–triassic extinction event32 animal life dominated various archosaurs dinosaurs pterosaurs aquatic reptiles ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs mosasaurs
climatic changes late jurassic cretaceous provided adaptive radiation jurassic height archosaur diversity first birds eutherian mammals also appeared angiosperms radiated sometime early cretaceous first tropics even temperature gradient allowed spread toward poles throughout period cretaceous angiosperms dominated tree floras many areas although evidence suggests biomass still dominated cycad ferns cretaceous–paleogene extinction
argued insects diversified angiosperms insect anatomy especially mouth parts seems particularly wellsuited flowering plants however major insect mouth parts preceded angiosperms insect diversification actually slowed arrived anatomy originally must suited purpose
