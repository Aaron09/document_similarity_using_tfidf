java platformedit
main article java platform
previously noted java platform exception general rule operating system software platform java language typically compiles virtual machine virtual runs code written language enables executable binary systems implement java virtual machine java programs executed natively using java processor isnt common mostly used embedded systems
java code running access osrelated services like disk network access appropriate privileges granted makes system calls behalf java application setup allows users decide appropriate protection level depending example disk network access usually enabled desktop applications browserbased applets also used enable access operating system specific functions
currently java standard edition programs microsoft windows macos several unixlike operating systems several nonunixlike operating systems like embedded systems mobile applications browser plugins used windows based devices android builtin support java also subsets java java card java platform micro edition designed resourceconstrained devices
crossplatform softwareedit
piece software considered crossplatform must able function computer architecture operating system developing program timeconsuming task different operating systems different application programming interfaces example linux uses different application software windows
particular operating system different computer architectures mean software written operating system automatically work architectures operating system supports example august 2006 openofficeorg natively amd64 intel lines processors implementing x8664 standards computers since changed openofficeorg suite software “mostly” ported 64bit systems7 also means program written popular programming language mean operating systems support programming language—or even operating system different architecture
applicationsedit
applications typically described crossplatform ideally accessible various browsers within different operating systems applications generally employ client–server system architecture vary widely complexity functionality wide variability significantly complicates goal crossplatform capability routinely odds goal advanced functionality
basic applications perform processing stateless server pass result client browser user interaction application consists simple exchanges data requests server responses types applications norm early phases world wide application development applications follow simple transaction model identical serving static pages today still relatively common especially crossplatform compatibility simplicity deemed critical advanced functionalities
prominent examples advanced applications include interface gmail a9com google maps website live search service bing microsoft advanced applications routinely depend additional features found recent versions popular browsers dependencies include ajax javascript dynamic html components rich internet applications older versions popular browsers tend lack support certain features
design strategiesedit
competing interests crossplatform compatibility advanced functionality numerous alternative application design strategies emerged strategies include

graceful degradation

graceful degradation attempts provide similar functionality users platforms diminishing functionality least common denominator limited client browsers example user attempting limitedfeature browser access gmail notice gmail switches basic mode reduced functionality differs crossplatform techniques attempt provide equivalent functionality adequate functionality across platforms

multiple codebases

multiple codebase applications maintain distinct codebases different hardware platforms equivalent functionality obviously requires duplication effort maintaining code worthwhile amount platformspecific code high

single codebase

strategy relies codebase compiled multiple platformspecific formats technique conditional compilation technique code common platforms repeated blocks code relevant certain platforms made conditional interpreted compiled needed another technique separation functionality disables functionality supported client browsers operating systems still delivering complete application user also separation concerns technique used development interpreted code scripting languages query platform running execute different blocks conditionally8

thirdparty libraries

thirdparty libraries attempt simplify crossplatform capability hiding complexities client differentiation behind single unified

responsive design

responsive design design approach aimed crafting visual layout sites provide optimal viewing experience—easy reading navigation minimum resizing panning scrolling—across wide range devices mobile phones desktop computer monitors little platformspecific code used technique
testing strategiesedit
complicated aspect crossplatform application design need software testing addition complications mentioned previously additional restriction browsers prohibit installation different versions browser operating system although several development approaches companies target multiple platforms result software requires substantial manual effort testing maintenance across supported platforms9 techniques full virtualization sometimes used workaround problem
using tools page object model cross platform tests scripted test case usable multiple versions app10 long different versions similar user interfaces versions tested time test case
traditional applicationsedit
although applications becoming increasingly popular many computer users still traditional application software rely clientwebserver architecture distinction traditional applications always unambiguous however applications many different features installation methods architectures overlap occur ways blur distinction nevertheless simplifying distinction common useful generalization
binary softwareedit
traditionally modern computing application software distributed endusers binary file especially executable files executables support operating system computer architecture built for—which means making single crossplatform executable would something massive task generally replaced offering selection executables platforms supported
software distributed binary executable software written programmer must build software different operating system computer architecture must toolset translates—transcompiles—a single codebase multiple binary executables example firefox opensource browser available windows macos powerpc apple calls universal binary linux multiple computer architectures four platforms case windows macos linux separate executable distributions although come source code
different toolsets perform different builds sufficient achieve variety working executables different platforms case software engineer must port amend code suitable computer architecture operating system example program firefox already runs windows family modified rebuilt linux potentially architectures well multiple versions code stored separate codebases merged codebase conditional compilation note porting must accompanied crossplatform building reverse case
alternative porting crossplatform virtualization allows applications compiled operating system system different andor operating system without modification source code binaries example apples rosetta built intelbased macintosh computers runs applications compiled previous generation macs used powerpc cpus another example powervm lx86 allows linuxx86 applications unmodified linuxpower operating system
scripts interpreted languagesedit
script considered crossplatform interpreter available multiple platforms script uses facilities provided language script written python unixlike system likely little modification windows python also runs windows also implementation python scripts ironpython framework goes many opensource programming languages available scripting languages
unlike binary executable files script used computers software interpret script script generally stored plain text text file issues however type line character sits lines generally however little work done make script written system another
quite popular crossplatform scripting interpreted languages

bash unix shell commonly linux modern unixlike systems well windows cygwin posix compatibility layer
perl scripting language first released 1987 used programming small system administration tasks
scripting language popular applications
python modern scripting language focus rapid application development easeofwriting instead program runtime efficiency
ruby scripting language whose purpose objectoriented easy read also used ruby rails
dynamic programming language suitable wide range uses including desktop applications networking administration testing many

video gamesedit
crossplatform multiplatform term also apply video games released range video game consoles specialized computers dedicated task playing games examples crossplatform video games include

miner 2049er
tomb raider legend
fifa video game series
series
minecraft

released across variety gaming platforms playstation xbox personal computers mobile devices
characteristics particular system lengthen time taken implement video game across multiple platforms video game initially released platforms later released remaining platforms typically situation occurs gaming system released video game developers need acquaint hardware software associated console
games become crossplatform licensing agreements developers video game console manufacturers limit development game particular console example disney could create game intention release latest nintendo sony game consoles disney license game sony first disney exchange required release game solely sony’s console short time indefinitely—effectively prohibiting crossplatform release duration
crossplatform playedit
main articles crossplatform play list video games support crossplatform play
several developers implemented means play games online using different platforms psyonix epic games microsoft valve corporation possess technology allows xbox playstation gamers play gamers leaving decision platform consumers first game allow level interactivity console games quake
games feature crossplatform online play include rocket league final fantasy street fighter killer instinct paragon fable fortune minecraft better together update windows editions pocket edition xbox
crossplatform programmingedit
crossplatform programming practice actively writing software work platform
approaches crossplatform programmingedit
different ways approaching problem writing crossplatform application program approach simply create multiple versions program different source trees—in words windows version program might source code files macintosh version might another foss system might anothercitation needed straightforward approach problem potential considerably expensive development cost development time especially corporate entities idea behind create different programs ability behave similarly also possible means developing crossplatform application result problems tracking fixing different source trees would different programmers thus different defects version
another approach used depend preexisting software hides differences platforms—called abstraction platform—such program unaware platform running could said programs platform agnostic programs java virtual machine built fashion
applications various methods crossplatform programming create final application example firefox browser uses abstraction build lowerlevel components separate source subtrees implementing platformspecific features like implementation scripting language help facilitate ease portability firefox implements javascript extending browser addition classic netscapestyle browser plugins much browser written javascript well

challenges crossplatform developmentedit
certain issues associated crossplatform development include

testing crossplatform applications considerably complicated since different platforms exhibit slightly different behaviors subtle bugs problem developers deride crossplatform development write debug everywhere take microsystems write anywhere marketing slogan
developers often restricted using lowest common denominator subset features available platforms hinder applications performance prohibit developers using platforms’ advanced features
different platforms often different user interface conventions crossplatform applications always accommodate example applications developed macos gnome supposed place important button righthand side window dialog whereas microsoft windows opposite convention though many differences subtle crossplatform application conform appropriately conventions feel clunky alien user working quickly opposing conventions even result data loss dialog confirming whether user wants save discard changes file
scripting languages virtual machines must translated native executable code time application executed imposing performance penalty penalty alleviated using advanced techniques like justintime compilation even using techniques computational overhead unavoidable
different platforms require native package formats multiplatform installers installanywhere address need
crossplatform execution environments suffer crossplatform security flaws creating fertile environment crossplatform malware
