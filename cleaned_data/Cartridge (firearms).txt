purposeedit
primary purpose handy allinone projectile right quantity propellant primer shot modern automatic weapons also provides energy move parts make fire repeatedly many weapons designed make readily available cartridge qualities
cartridge case seals firing chamber directions excepting bore firing strikes primer ignites primer compound deflagrates detonate rapidly burns explode burning primer ignites propellant
gases burning powder pressurize expand case seal chamber wall propellant gases push bullet base response pressure bullet move path least resistance bore barrel bullet leaves barrel chamber pressure drops atmospheric pressure case elastically expanded chamber pressure contracts slightly eases removal case chamber
materialsedit
projectile made virtually anything lead material choice high density ductility
propellant long gunpowder still superseded better compositions generically called smokeless powder
early primer simply fine gunpowder poured tube could ignited external source ignition fuse spark modern primers shock sensitive chemicals enclosed small capsule ignited percussion instance ignition electricityprimed even primer design propellant directly ignited
case commonly made brass resistant corrosion brass case head workhardened withstand high pressures cartridges allow manipulation extraction ejection without tearing metal neck body portion brass case easily annealed make case ductile enough allow reforming reloaded many times
steel used plinking ammunition well military ammunition mainly former soviet union china steel less expensive brass feasible reload reuse steel cases military forces typically consider small arms cartridge cases disposable onetimeuse devices however case weight mass affects much ammunition soldier carry lighter steel cases military advantage conversely steel susceptible contamination damage cases varnished otherwise sealed elements
downside caused increased strength steel neck cases compared annealed neck brass case propellant blow back past neck chamber constituents gases condense relatively cold chamber wall solid propellant residue make extraction fired cases difficult less problem small arms former warsaw pact nations designed much larger chamber tolerances nato weapons
aluminum cased cartridges available commercially generally reloaded aluminum fatigues easily firing resizing calibers also nonstandard primer sizes discourage reloaders attempting reuse cases
plastic cases commonly used shotgun shells manufacturers offer polymer centerfire cartridges
historically paper used earliest cartridges
specificationsedit
critical cartridge specifications include neck size bullet weight caliber maximum pressure headspace overall length case body diameter taper shoulder design type generally every characteristic specific cartridge type tightly controlled types interchangeable exceptions exist generally shorter cylindrical rimmed cartridge used longer chamber short long rifle chamber special magnum chamber centerfire primer type boxer berdan interchangeable although case deviation specifications result firearm damage instances injury death similarly wrong type cartridge given damage cause bodily injury
cartridge specifications determined several standards organizations including saami united states many european states nato also performs tests military cartridges member nations differences testing methods nato cartridges headstamped nato cross present unsafe combination loaded weapon chambered cartridge certified testing bodies2
bullet diameter measured either fraction inch usually 1100 11000 millimeters cartridge case length also designated inches millimeters

early allmetal cartridges pinfire rimfire types
first metallic centerfire cartridge technically invented jean samuel pauly first decades 19th century however bore little resemblance modern centerfire cartridge would invented mid19th century frenchman louisnicolas flobert invented 1845 indoor shooting security first rimfire metallic cartridge constituted bullet percussion cap1718 usually derived calibres since called flobert cartridge bosquette cartridge doesnt contain powder propellant substance contained cartridge percussion itself19 englishspeaking countries flobert cartridge corresponds ammunition
french gunsmith benjamin houllier improved lefaucheux pinfire cardboard cartridge patented paris 1846 first fully metallic pinfire cartridge containing powder pinfire metallic cartridge1520 also included patent claims centerfire primed cartridges using brass copper casings12 houllier commercialised weapons association gunsmiths blanchard charles robert2122
united states 1857 flobert cartridge inspired short another rimfire especially conceived first american revolver using rimfire cartridges smith wesson model year 1856 lemat first american frenchdesigned breechloading revolver used pinfire cartridges rimfire formerly employee colts patent firearms manufacturing company rollin white first america conceive idea revolver cylinder bored accept metallic cartridges circa 1852 first world boredthrough cylinders probably lefaucheux 1845 invented pepperboxrevolver loaded rear using boredthrough cylinders23 however samuel colt refused innovation white left colt went smith wesson rent licence patent model light 1857 patent didnt definitely expire 1870 allowing smith wesson competitors design commercialise revolving breechloaders using metallic cartridges famous models time colts open 18711872 single action army peacemaker 1873 rifles leveraction mechanism patents obstructed rollin whites patent infringement white held patent concerning drilled cylinders revolving mechanisms thus larger caliber rimfire cartridges soon introduced 1857 smith wesson short ammunition introduced first time rifle cartridges used american civil including henry 5656 spencer 1860 however large rimfire cartridges soon replaced centerfire cartridges could safely handle higher pressures2425

nomenclatureedit
name given cartridge necessarily reflect cartridge dimension name merely standardized accepted moniker saami sporting arms ammunition manufacturers’ institute european counterpart members organizations specify correct cartridge names cartridge names correctly presented never include naked leading decimal point
common misnomer refer cartridge certain “caliber” “3006 caliber” correct full name cartridge 3006 springfield means introduced 1906 sporting arms consistent definition “caliber” bore diameter dozens unique 30caliber cartridge types exist
considerable variation cartridge nomenclature names sometimes reflect various characteristics cartridge example winchester uses bullet 3081000inch diameter standardized winchester conversely cartridge names often reflect nothing related cartridge obvious example uses bullet 2241000inch diameter fired 22in bore portions cartridge name reflect nothing desires standardized cartridge many similar examples exist example zipper fireball remington winchester remington winchester winchester
numbers used cartridge name second number reflect variety things frequently first number reflects bore diameter inches millimeters second number reflects case length inches example 762×51mm nato refers bore diameter overall case length commercial version winchester
older black powder cartridges second number typically refers powder charge grains example 5090 sharps 50inch bore used nominal charge grains black powder
many cartridges designated threenumber system 451203¼ sharps 45caliber bore grains black powder 3¼inch long case times similar threenumber system indicated bore caliber charge grains bullet weight grains 4570500 government example
often name reflects company individual standardized newton characteristic important person
special actually nominal bullet diameter 03570 inches jacketed 03580 inches lead case nominal diameter 03800 inches hence name historically logical hole drilled chambers 36caliber capandball revolvers converting work cartridges 03800 inches cartridges made work revolvers logically named colt original cartridges used heeled bullet like rimfire bullet diameter case early colt army bore diameter allow diameter bullet slide barrel cylinder bored straight step later versions used inside case lubricated bullet diameter instead original reduction bore diameter difference special bullet diameter case diameter reflects thickness case mouth approximately 111000inch side magnum evolved special named reflect bullet diameter thousandths inch case diameter “magnum” used indicate longer case higher operating pressure
