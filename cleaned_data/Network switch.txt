switch device computer network connects together devices multiple data cables plugged switch enable communication different networked devices switches manage flow data across network transmitting received network packet devices packet intended networked device connected switch identified network address allowing switch direct flow traffic maximizing security efficiency network
switch intelligent ethernet simply retransmits packets every port except port packet received unable distinguish different recipients achieving overall lower network efficiency
ethernet switch operates data link layer layer model create separate collision domain switch port device connected switch port transfer data ports time transmissions interferea broadcasts still forwarded connected devices switch newly formed network segment continues broadcast domain
segmentation involves switch split larger collision domain smaller ones order reduce collision probability improve overall network throughput extreme case microsegmentation device located dedicated switch port contrast ethernet separate collision domain switch ports allows computers dedicated bandwidth pointtopoint connections network also fullduplex mode fullduplex mode transmitter receiver collision domain making collisions impossible

switches learn topologies many layers forward layers tend common features highperformance applications modern commercial switches primarily ethernet interfaces

layer hubs higherlayer switchesedit
network repeater simple network device manage traffic coming packet entering port flooded repeated every port except port entry specifically symbol repeated flows minimum delay line interface repeater receive forward single speed12 since every packet repeated every port packet collisions affect entire network limiting overall capacity
specialized applications network useful copying traffic multiple network sensors highend network switches usually feature called port mirroring provides functionality
network switch creates layer endtoend connection virtually originally mandatory bridging function switch uses information taken layer select packet particular ports forwarded removing requirement every node presented traffic result connection lines switched literally instead appear packet level
