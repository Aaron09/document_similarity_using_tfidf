reflexive verbsedit
bulgarian uses reflexive verbal forms actions performed agent onto behave similar many indoeuropean languages french spanish reflexive expressed invariable particle senote originally clitic form accusative reflexive pronoun thus

miya wash miya wash miesh wash
pitam pitam pitash

action performed others particles used like normal verb

miya wash
pitash

sometimes reflexive verb form similar necessarily identical meaning nonreflexive verb

kazvam kazvam name call
vizhdam vizhdame meet

cases reflexive verb completely different meaning nonreflexive counterpart

karam drive karam someone
gotvya cook gotvya ready
smeya dare smeya laugh


indirect actions

action performed indirect object particles change derivatives

kazvam kazvash kazvam
peya singing singing singing
gotvya cook gotvyat cook gotvya cook

cases particle ambiguous indirect object possessive meaning

miya ratsete wash hands miya ratsete wash hands
pitam priyatelite friends pitam priyatelite friends
iskam topkata want ball back

difference transitive intransitive verbs lead significant differences meaning minimal change

haresvash like haresvash like pleasing
otivam going otivam going home

particle often used indicate personal relationship action

haresvam like haresvam precise translation roughly translates really close heart
stanahme priyateli became friends stanahme priyateli meaning sounds friendlier

remaining adverbs formed ways longer productive language small number original derived words example вътре inside outside много verymuch rest mostly fossilized case forms

adverbs sometimes reduplicated emphasize qualitative quantitative properties actions moods relations performed subject sentence бавнобавно rather slowly едваедва great difficulty съвсемсъвсем quite thoroughly
syntaxedit
bulgarian employs clitic doubling mostly emphatic purposes example following constructions common colloquial bulgarian

дадох подаръка мария
gave present maria


дадох подаръка мария
gave present maria

phenomenon practically obligatory spoken language case inversion signalling information structure writing clitic doubling skipped instances somewhat bookish effect

подаръка дадох мария
present igave maria


мария дадох подаръка
maria igave present

sometimes doubling signals syntactic relations thus

петър иван изядоха вълците
petar ivan wolves
transl petar ivan eaten wolves

contrasted

петър иван изядоха вълците
petar ivan wolves
transl petar ivan wolves

case clitic doubling colloquial alternative formal bookish passive voice would constructed follows

петър иван бяха изядени вълците
petar ivan eaten wolves

clitic doubling also fully obligatory spoken written norm clauses including several special expressions short accusative dative pronouns играе feel like playing студено cold боли ръката hurts

иван играе
itfeelslikesleeping ivan itfeelslikeplaying
transl feel like sleeping ivan feels like playing
студено топло
itis cold youplur youplur itis warm
transl cold warm
иван боли гърлото мене боли главата
ivan aches throat aches head
transl ivan sore throat headache

except examples clitic doubling considered inappropriate formal context bulgarian grammars usually treat phenomenon extensively
