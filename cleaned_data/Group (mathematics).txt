definition illustrationedit
first example integersedit
familiar groups integers consists numbers

together addition

following properties integer addition serve model abstract group axioms given definition

integers also integer addition integers always yields integer property known closure addition
integers expressed words adding first adding result gives final result adding property known associativity
integer zero called identity element addition adding integer returns integer
every integer integer integer called inverse element integer denoted

integers together operation form mathematical object belonging broad class sharing similar structural aspects appropriately understand structures collective following abstract definition developed

richard borcherds mathematicians outer view inner world
group together operation called group combines elements form another element denoted qualify group operation must satisfy four requirements known group axioms5

closure

associativity

identity element
exists element every element equation holds element unique thus speaks identity element
inverse element
exists element commonly denoted operation denoted identity element

result operation depend order operands words result combining element element need yield result combining element element equation



always true equation always holds group integers addition integers commutativity addition groups commutativity equation always holds called abelian groups honor niels henrik abel symmetry group described following section example group abelian

vertical reflection

horizontal reflection

diagonal reflection

counterdiagonal reflection



identity operation leaving everything unchanged denoted
rotations square around center clockwise 180° clockwise 270° clockwise denoted respectively
reflections vertical horizontal middle line diagonals


symmetries represented functions functions sends point square corresponding point symmetry example sends point rotation clockwise around squares center sends point reflection across squares vertical middle line composing symmetry functions gives another symmetry function symmetries determine group called dihedral group degree denoted underlying group symmetry functions group operation function composition7 symmetries combined composing functions applying first square second result first application result performing first written symbolically right left

given symmetries described operation group axioms understood follows


closure axiom demands composition symmetries also symmetry another example group operation



rotating 270° clockwise reflecting horizontally equals reflecting along counterdiagonal indeed every combination symmetries still gives symmetry checked using group table
associativity constraint deals composing symmetries starting three elements possible ways using three symmetries order determine symmetry square ways first compose single symmetry compose symmetry first compose compose resulting symmetry associativity condition



means ways product many group elements simplified grouping example checked using group table right






equals









associativity true symmetries square addition numbers true operations instance subtraction numbers associative
identity element symmetry leaving everything unchanged symmetry performing equals symbolic form





inverse element undoes transformation element every symmetry undone following transformations—identity reflections 180° rotation r2—is inverse performing twice brings square back original orientation rotations others inverses rotating rotation 270° vice versa yields rotation 360° leaves square unchanged symbols
