ecoregion ecological region ecologically geographically defined area smaller bioregion turn smaller ecozone three either less greater ecosystemcitation neededclarification needed ecoregions cover relatively large areas land water contain characteristic geographically distinct assemblages natural communities species biodiversity flora fauna ecosystems characterise ecoregion tends distinct ecoregions theory biodiversity conservation ecoregions relatively large areas land water probability encountering different species communities given point remains relatively constant within acceptable range variation largely undefined point
three caveats appropriate biogeographic mapping approaches firstly single biogeographic framework optimal taxa ecoregions reflect best compromise many taxa possible secondly ecoregion boundaries rarely form abrupt edges rather ecotones mosaic habitats bound thirdly ecoregions contain habitats differ assigned biome biogeographic provinces originate various barriers physical plate tectonics topographic highs climatic latitudinal variation seasonal range ocean chemical related salinity oxygen levels
