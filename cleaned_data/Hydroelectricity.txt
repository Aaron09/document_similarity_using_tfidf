properties
advantages




ffestiniog power station generate electricity within seconds demand arising


flexibility
hydropower flexible source electricity since stations ramped quickly adapt changing energy demands2 hydro turbines startup time order minutes22 takes around seconds bring unit cold startup full load much shorter turbines steam plants23 power generation also decreased quickly surplus power generation24 hence limited capacity hydropower units generally used produce base power except vacating flood pool meeting downstream needs25 instead serves backup nonhydro generators24
costhigh value power
major advantage conventional hydroelectric dams reservoirs ability store water cost dispatch later high value clean electricity average cost electricity hydro station larger megawatts cents kilowatthour2 used peak power meet demand hydroelectricity higher value base power much higher value compared intermittent energy sources
hydroelectric stations long economic lives plants still service 50–100 years26 operating labor cost also usually plants automated personnel site normal operation
serves multiple purposes hydroelectric station added relatively construction cost providing useful revenue stream offset costs operation calculated sale electricity three gorges cover construction costs years full generation27 additionally data shows countries large hydropower dams costly take long build deliver positive risk adjusted return unless appropriate risk management measures place28
suitability industrial applications
many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks created serve specific industrial enterprises dedicated hydroelectric projects often built provide substantial amounts electricity needed aluminium electrolytic plants example grand coulee switched support alcoa aluminium bellingham washington united states american world airplanes allowed provide irrigation power citizens addition aluminium power suriname brokopondo reservoir constructed provide electricity alcoa aluminium industry zealands manapouri power station constructed supply electricity aluminium smelter tiwai point
reduced emissions
since hydroelectric dams fuel power generation produce carbon dioxide carbon dioxide initially produced construction project methane given annually reservoirs hydro normally lowest lifecycle greenhouse emissions power generation29 compared fossil fuels generating equivalent amount electricity hydro displaced three billion tonnes emissions 201130 measurement greenhouse related externality comparison energy sources found externe project paul scherrer institute university stuttgart funded european commission31 according study hydroelectricity produces least amount greenhouse gases externality energy source32 coming second place wind third nuclear energy fourth solar photovoltaic32 greenhouse impact hydroelectricity found especially temperate climates study local energy europe presumably similar conditions prevail north america northern asia regular natural freezethaw cycle associated seasonal plant decay regrowth greater greenhouse emission impacts found tropical regions reservoirs power stations tropical regions produce larger amount methane temperate areas33
uses reservoir
reservoirs created hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities water sports become tourist attractions countries aquaculture reservoirs common multiuse dams installed irrigation support agriculture relatively constant water supply large hydro dams control floods would otherwise affect people living downstream project34
disadvantages
also renewable energy debate disadvantages hydroelectricity
ecosystem damage loss land




hydroelectric power stations dams would submerge large areas land requirement reservoir merowe sudan


large reservoirs associated traditional hydroelectric power stations result submersion extensive areas upstream dams sometimes destroying biologically rich productive lowland riverine valley forests marshland grasslands damming interrupts flow rivers harm local ecosystems building large dams reservoirs often involves displacing people wildlife2 loss land often exacerbated habitat fragmentation surrounding areas caused reservoir35
hydroelectric projects disruptive surrounding aquatic ecosystems upstream downstream plant site generation hydroelectric power changes downstream river environment water exiting turbine usually contains little suspended sediment lead scouring river beds loss riverbanks36 since turbine gates often opened intermittently rapid even daily fluctuations river flow observed
water loss evaporation
2011 study united states national renewable energy laboratory concluded hydroelectric plants consumed 1425 18000 gallons water megawatthour galmwh electricity generated evaporation losses reservoir median loss 4491 galmwh higher loss generation technologies cooling towers including concentrating solar power galmwh trough galmwh tower coal galmwh nuclear galmwh natural galmwh multiple uses reservoirs water supply recreation flood control reservoir evaporation attributed power production37
siltation flow shortage
water flows ability transport particles heavier downstream negative effect dams subsequently power stations particularly rivers within catchment areas high siltation siltation fill reservoir reduce capacity control floods along causing additional horizontal pressure upstream portion eventually reservoirs become full sediment useless overtop flood fail3839
changes amount river flow correlate amount energy produced lower river flows reduce amount live storage reservoir therefore reducing amount water used hydroelectricity result diminished river flow power shortages areas depend heavily hydroelectric power risk flow shortage increase result climate change40 study colorado river united states suggest modest climate changes increase temperature degree celsius resulting decline precipitation might reduce river runoff 4040 brazil particular vulnerable heavy reliance hydroelectricity increasing temperatures lower water alterations rainfall regime could reduce total energy production annually century40
methane emissions reservoirs




hoover united states large conventional dammedhydro facility installed capacity 2080


also environmental impacts reservoirs
lower positive impacts found tropical regions noted reservoirs power plants tropical regions produce substantial amounts methane plant material flooded areas decaying anaerobic environment forming methane greenhouse according world commission dams report41 reservoir large compared generating capacity less watts square metre surface area clearing forests area undertaken prior impoundment reservoir greenhouse emissions reservoir higher conventional oilfired thermal generation plant42
boreal reservoirs canada northern europe however greenhouse emissions typically kind conventional fossilfuel thermal generation class underwater logging operation targets drowned forests mitigate effect forest decay43
relocation
another disadvantage hydroelectric dams need relocate people living reservoirs planned 2000 world commission dams estimated dams physically displaced 4080 million people worldwide44
failure risks
also failure list hydroelectric power station failures
large conventional dammedhydro facilities hold back large volumes water failure poor construction natural disasters sabotage catastrophic downriver settlements infrastructure
typhoon nina 1975 banqiao failed southern china years worth rain fell within hours resulting flood resulted deaths 26000 people another 145000 epidemics millions left homeless
creation geologically inappropriate location cause disasters 1963 disaster vajont italy almost 2000 people died45
malpasset failure fréjus french riviera côte dazur southern france collapsed december 1959 killing people resulting flood46
smaller dams micro hydro facilities create less risk form continuing hazards even decommissioned example small earthen embankment kelly barnes failed 1977 twenty years power station decommissioned causing deaths47
comparison interactions methods power generation
hydroelectricity eliminates flue emissions fossil fuel combustion including pollutants sulfur dioxide nitric oxide carbon monoxide dust mercury coal hydroelectricity also avoids hazards coal mining indirect health effects coal emissions
nuclear power
compared nuclear power hydroelectricity construction requires altering large areas environment nuclear power station small footprint hydropowerstation failures caused tens thousands deaths nuclear station failure354547 creation garrison example required native american land create lake sakakawea shoreline 1320 miles caused inhabitants sell arable land million 194948
however nuclear power relatively inflexible although nuclear power reduce output reasonably quickly since cost nuclear power dominated high infrastructure costs cost unit energy goes significantly production nuclear power mostly used baseload contrast hydroelectricity supply peak power much lower cost hydroelectricity thus often used complement nuclear sources load following
wind power
wind power goes predictable variation season intermittent daily basis maximum wind generation little relationship peak daily electricity consumption wind peak night power isnt needed still electrical demand highest occasionally weather patterns result wind days weeks time hydroelectric reservoir capable storing weeks output useful balance generation grid peak wind power offset minimum hydropower minimum wind offset maximum hydropower easily regulated character hydroelectricity used compensate intermittent nature wind power conversely cases wind power used spare water later seasons
areas hydropower pumped storage serves similar role much higher cost lower efficiency example norways trading sweden denmark netherlands possibly germany future49 norway hydropower flatland neighbors installing wind power
