chronobiology field biology examines periodic cyclic phenomena living organisms adaptation solar lunarrelated rhythms1 cycles known biological rhythms chronobiology comes ancient greek χρόνος chrónos meaning time biology pertains study science life related terms chronomics chronome used cases describe either molecular mechanisms involved chronobiological phenomena quantitative aspects chronobiology particularly comparison cycles organisms required
chronobiological studies include limited comparative anatomy physiology genetics molecular biology behavior organisms within biological rhythms mechanics1 aspects include epigenetics development reproduction ecology evolution

descriptionedit
variations timing duration biological activity living organisms occur many essential biological processes occur animals eating sleeping mating hibernating migration cellular regeneration plants leaf movements photosynthetic reactions microbial organisms fungi protozoa even found bacteria especially among cyanobacteria bluegreen algae bacterial circadian rhythms important rhythm chronobiology circadian rhythm roughly 24hour cycle shown physiological processes organisms term circadian comes latin circa meaning around dies meaning approximately regulated circadian clocks
circadian rhythm broken routine cycles 24hour day2

diurnal describes organisms active daytime
nocturnal describes organisms active night
crepuscular describes animals primarily active dawn dusk hours whitetailed deer bats

circadian rhythms defined endogenously regulated biological cycles regulated exogenous signals cases multitrophic systems exhibit rhythms driven circadian clock members also influenced reset external factors endogenous plant cycles regulate activity bacterium controlling availability plantproduced photosynthate
many important cycles also studied including

infradian rhythms cycles longer examples include circannual annual cycles govern migration reproduction cycles many plants animals human menstrual cycle
ultradian rhythms cycles shorter hours 90minute cycle 4hour nasal cycle 3hour cycle growth hormone production
tidal rhythms commonly observed marine life follow roughly 124hour transition high tide back
lunar rhythms follow lunar month days relevant marine life level tides modulated across lunar cycle
gene oscillations genes expressed certain hours hours

within cycle time period process active called acrophase3 process less active cycle bathyphase trough phase particular moment highest activity peak maximum lowest point nadir high process gets measured amplitude
