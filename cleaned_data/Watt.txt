femtowattedit
femtowatt equal quadrillionth 10−15 watt technologically important powers measured femtowatts typically found references radio radar receivers example meaningful tuner performance figures sensitivity quieting signaltonoise require energy applied antenna input specified input levels often stated decibels referenced femtowatt 02739 microvolt across 75ohm load 05477 microvolt across 300ohm load specification takes account input impedance tuner
picowattedit
picowatt confused much larger petawatt equal trillionth 10−12 watt technologically important powers measured picowatts typically used reference radio radar receivers acoustics science radio astronomy
nanowattedit
nanowatt equal billionth 10−9 watt important powers measured nanowatts also typically used reference radio radar receivers
microwattedit
microwatt equal millionth 10−6 watt important powers measured microwatts typically stated medical instrumentation systems wide variety scientific engineering instruments also reference radio radar receivers compact solar cells devices calculators watches typically measured microwatts3
milliwattedit
milliwatt equal thousandth 10−3 watt typical laser pointer outputs five milliwatts light power whereas typical hearing people uses less milliwatt4 audio signals electronic signal levels often measured referenced milliwatt
kilowattedit
kilowatt kilowatts redirect place united states kilowatt california musician james watts kilowatts musician
redirects uses disambiguation
kilowatt equal thousand watts unit typically used express output power engines power electric motors tools machines heaters also common unit used express electromagnetic power output broadcast radio television transmitters
kilowatt approximately equal horsepower small electric heater heating element kilowatt average electric power consumption household united states kilowattii
surface area square meter earth receives typically kilowatt sunlight solar irradiance clear close equator6
megawattedit
megawatt equal million watts many events machines produce sustain conversion energy scale including large electric motors large warships aircraft carriers cruisers submarines large server farms data centers scientific research equipment supercolliders output pulses large lasers large residential commercial building several megawatts electric power heat railways modern highpowered electric locomotives typically peak power output although produce much eurostar example uses heavy dieselelectric locomotives typically produceuse nuclear power plants summer capacities 1300
earliest citing megawatt oxford english dictionary reference 1900 websters international dictionary english language also states megawatt appeared november 1947 article journal science 5062
gigawattedit
gigawatt equal billion watts gigawatt 1000 megawatts unit often used large power plants power grids example 2010 power shortages chinas shanxi province expected increase installed capacity wind power germany largest unit four belgian doel nuclear power station peak output gw10 hvdc converters built power ratings gw11
terawattedit
terawatt equal trillion 1012 watts total power used humans worldwide commonly measured terawatts primary energy powerful lasers mid1960s mid1990s produced power terawatts nanosecond time frames average lightning strike peaks terawatt strikes last microseconds
petawattedit
petawatt equal quadrillion 1015 watts produced current generation lasers timescales order picoseconds 10−12 laser lawrence livermores nova laser achieved power output 7015125000000000000♠125×1015 process called chirped pulse amplification duration pulse roughly 6987500000000000000♠5×10−13 giving total energy another example laser fast ignition experiments lfex institute laser engineering osaka university achieved power output duration approximately ps1314

conventions electric power industryedit
electric power industry megawatt electrical mwe16 mwe17 refers convention electric power produced generator megawatt thermal thermal megawatt18 mwth mwth refers thermal power produced plant example embalse nuclear power plant argentina uses fission reactor generate 2109 heat creates steam drive turbine generates electricity prefixes sometimes used example gigawatt electrical international bureau weights measures maintains sistandard states information quantity attached unit symbol instead quantity symbol pthermal rather units nonsi19 compliance energy company dong energy uses unit megawatt produced electrical power equivalent unit megajoules delivered heating power combined heat power station avedøre power station20
describing alternating current electricity another distinction made watt voltampere units equivalent simple resistive circuits differ loads exhibit electrical reactance
radio transmissionedit
main article effective radiated power
radio stations usually report power transmitters units watts referring effective radiated power refers relative power transmission directed towards horizon maximum geographic coverage rather uniformly broadcast directions
difference watts watthours watts houredit
terms power energy frequently confused power rate energy generated consumed hence measured units watts represent energy unit time
example light bulb power rating 100w turned hour energy used watt hours kilowatt hour amount energy would light 40watt bulb hours 50watt bulb hours power station would rated multiples watts example three gorges rated approximately gigawatts annual energy sales output would multiples watt hours major energy production consumption often expressed terawatt hours given period often calendar year financial year terawatt hour equal sustained power approximately megawatts period year
watt second unit energy equal joule kilowatt hour 3600000 watt seconds watt second used example rate energy storage flash lamps used photography although term joule generally employedcitation needed
invented incorrect terms watts hour often misused watts would correct21 watts hour would properly refer change power hour watts hour might useful characterize rampup behavior power plants slowreacting plant power could change slowly example power plant changes power output minutes would rampup rate
