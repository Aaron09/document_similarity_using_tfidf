elevator airflow diagram


elevator conditioning fast becoming popular concept around world primary reason installing elevator conditioner comfort provides traveling elevator stabilizes condition inside elevator elevator conditioners used countries cold climates thermostat used reverse refrigeration cycle warm elevator
heat generated cooling process dissipated hoistway elevator ordinarily airtight heat reenter reduce overall cooling effect
lobby constantly leaks elevator shaft elevator movements well elevator shaft ventilation requirements using conditioned elevator increase energy costs however using independent elevator conditioner achieve better temperature control inside energy used
conditioning poses problem elevators condensation occurs condensed water produced disposed otherwise would create flooding elevator hoistway
methods removing condensed wateredit
least four ways remove condensed water conditioner however solution pros cons
atomizingedit
atomizing also known misting condensed water dispose condensed water spraying ultrafine water droplets onto coils conditioner ensures condensed water evaporates quickly
though best methods dispose condensed water also costliest nozzle atomizes water easily gets choked majority cost goes maintaining entire atomizing system
boilingedit
disposing condensed water works firstly collecting condensed water heating boiling point condensed water eventually evaporated thereby disposing
consumers reluctant employ system high rate energy used dispose water
cascadingedit
cascading method works flowing condensed water directly onto coils conditioner eventually evaporates condensed water
downside technology coils extremely high temperature condensed water evaporated chance water might evaporate entirely would cause water overflow onto exterior
drainage systemedit
drainage system works creating sump collect condensed water using pump dispose drainage system
efficient method comes heavy price cost building sump moreover maintaining pump make sure operates expensive furthermore pipes used drainage would look ugly exterior system also cannot implemented built project
