opportunity cost encompasses money could including lending others investing elsewhere holding cash spending funds
charging interest equal inflation preserves lenders purchasing power compensate time value money real terms lender prefer invest another product rather consume return might obtain competing investments factor determining interest rate demand
inflationedit
since lender deferring consumption wish bare minimum recover enough increased cost goods inflation future inflation unknown three ways might achieved

charge interest plus inflation many governments issue realreturn inflation indexed bonds principal amount interest payments continually increased rate inflation discussion real interest rate
decide expected inflation rate still leaves lender exposed risk unexpected inflation
allow interest rate periodically changed fixed interest rate remains throughout life debt variable floating rates reset derivative products allow hedging swaps

default interestedit
default interest rate interest borrower must material breach loan covenant
default interest usually much higher original interest rate since reflecting aggravation financial risk borrower default interest compensates lender added risk
borrowers perspective means failure make regular payment payment periods failure taxes insurance premiums loan collateral lead substantially higher interest entire remaining term loan
banks tend default interest loan agreements order separate different scenarios
jurisdictions default interest clauses unenforceable public policy

shorter terms often less risk default exposure inflation near future easier predict circumstances shortterm interest rates lower longerterm interest rates upward sloping yield curve
government interventionedit

national governments provided course country retained currency influence interest rates thus supply demand loans thus altering total loans bonds issued generally speaking higher real interest rate reduces broad money supply
