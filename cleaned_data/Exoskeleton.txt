roleedit
exoskeletons contain rigid resistant components fulfill functional roles including protection excretion sensing support feeding acting barrier desiccation terrestrial organisms exoskeletons role defense pests predators support providing attachment framework musculature2
exoskeletons contain chitin addition calcium carbonate makes harder strongercitation needed ingrowths arthropod exoskeleton known apodemes serve attachment sites muscles structures composed chitin approximately times strong twice stiff vertebrate tendons similar tendons apodemes stretch store elastic energy jumping notably locusts3
diversityedit
many different species produce exoskeletons composed range materials bone cartilage dentine used ostracoderm fish turtles chitin forms exoskeleton arthropods including insects arachnids spiders crustaceans crabs lobsters fungi bacteria calcium carbonates constitute shells molluscs brachiopods tubebuilding polychaete worms silica forms exoskeleton microscopic diatoms radiolaria species mollusc scalyfoot gastropod even makes iron sulfides greigite pyrite
organisms foraminifera agglutinate exoskeletons sticking grains sand shell exterior contrary common misconception echinoderms possess exoskeleton test always contained within layer living tissue
exoskeletons evolved independently many times lineages evolved calcified exoskeletons alone4 lineages produced tough outer coatings analogous exoskeleton mammals coating constructed bone armadillo hair pangolin armor reptiles like turtles ankylosaurs constructed bone crocodiles bony scutes horny scales

borings exoskeletons provide evidence animal behavior case boring sponges attacked hard clam shell death clam producing trace fossil entobia


exoskeletons hard parts organisms greatly useful assisting preservation organisms whose soft parts usually fossilized mineralized exoskeletons preserved shell fragments example possession exoskeleton also permits couple routes fossilization instance tough layer resist compaction allowing mold organism formed underneath skeleton later decay7 alternatively exceptional preservation result chitin mineralized burgess shale8 transformed resistant polymer keratin resist decay recovered
however dependence fossilized skeletons also significantly limits understanding evolution parts organisms already mineralized usually preserved shells molluscs helps exoskeletons often contain muscle scars marks muscles attached exoskeleton allow reconstruction much organisms internal parts exoskeleton alone7 significant limitation although 30plus phyla living animals twothirds phyla never found fossils animal species softbodied decay become fossilized9
mineralized skeletons first appear fossil record shortly base cambrian period million years evolution mineralized exoskeleton seen possible driving force cambrian explosion animal life resulting diversification predatory defensive tactics however precambrian ediacaran organisms produced tough outer shells7 others cloudina calcified exoskeleton10 cloudina shells even show evidence predation form borings10
evolutionedit
information small shelly fauna
whole fossil record contains mineralised exoskeletons since durable since lineages exoskeletons thought started nonmineralised exoskeleton later mineralised makes difficult comment early evolution lineages exoskeleton known however short course time cambrian period exoskeletons made various materials silica calcium phosphate calcite aragonite even gluedtogether mineral flakes sprang range different environments11 lineages adopted form calcium carbonate stable ocean time first mineralised change mineral morph even became less favorable4
precambrian ediacaran organisms produced tough nonmineralized outer shells7 others cloudina calcified exoskeleton10 mineralized skeletons become common beginning cambrian period rise small shelly fauna base cambrian miniature fossils become diverse abundant abruptness illusion since chemical conditions preserved small shellies appeared time12 shellforming organisms appear cambrian period bryozoans calcifying phylum appear later ordovician sudden appearance shells linked change ocean chemistry made calcium compounds shells constructed stable enough precipitated shell however unlikely sufficient cause main construction cost shells creating proteins polysaccharides required shells composite structure precipitation mineral components2 skeletonization also appeared almost exactly time animals started burrowing avoid predation earliest exoskeletons made gluedtogether mineral flakes suggesting skeletonization likewise response increased pressure predators11
ocean chemistry also control mineral shells constructed calcium carbonate forms stable calcite metastable aragonite stable within reasonable range chemical environments rapidly becomes unstable outside range oceans contain relatively high proportion magnesium compared calcium aragonite stable magnesium concentration drops becomes less stable hence harder incorporate exoskeleton tend dissolve
exception molluscs whose shells often comprise forms lineages form mineral form used appears reflect seawater chemistry thus form easily precipitated time lineage first evolved calcified skeleton change thereafter4 however relative abundance calcite aragoniteusing lineages reflect subsequent seawater chemistry magnesiumcalcium ratio oceans appears negligible impact organisms success instead controlled mainly well recover mass extinctions13 recently discovered14 modern gastropod chrysomallon squamiferum lives near deepsea hydrothermal vents illustrates influence ancient modern local chemical environments shell made aragonite found earliest fossil mollusks also armor plates sides foot mineralized iron sulfides pyrite greigite never previously found metazoan whose ingredients emitted large quantities vents2
