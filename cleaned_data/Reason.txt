rené descartes


accordingly 17th century rené descartes explicitly rejected traditional notion humans rational animals suggesting instead nothing thinking things along lines things nature grounds knowledge outside understanding therefore subject doubt
search foundation possible knowledge descartes deliberately decided throw doubt knowledge except mind process thinking

time admit nothing necessarily true therefore precisely nothing thinking thing mind intellect understanding reason words whose meanings previously ignorant17

eventually became known epistemological subjectcentred reason based knowing subject perceives rest world objects studied successfully mastered applying knowledge accumulated study breaking tradition many thinkers descartes explicitly divide incorporeal soul parts reason intellect describing indivisible incorporeal entity
contemporary descartes thomas hobbes described reason broader version addition subtraction limited numbers18 understanding reason sometimes termed calculative reason similar descartes hobbes asserted discourse whatsoever absolute knowledge fact past come sense memory absolute knowledge19
late 17th century 18th century john locke david hume developed descartes line thought still hume took especially skeptical direction proposing could possibility deducing relationships cause effect therefore knowledge based reasoning alone even seems otherwise2021
hume famously remarked speak strictly philosophically talk combat passion reason reason ought slave passions never pretend office serve obey them22 hume also took definition reason unorthodox extremes arguing unlike predecessors human reason qualitatively different either simply conceiving individual ideas judgments associating ideas23 reason nothing wonderful unintelligible instinct souls carries along certain train ideas endows particular qualities according particular situations relations24 followed animals reason much less complex human reason
18th century immanuel kant attempted show hume wrong demonstrating transcendental self necessary condition experience therefore suggested kant basis self fact possible reason conditions limits human knowledge long limits respected reason vehicle morality justice aesthetics theories knowledge epistemology understanding
substantive formal reasonedit
formulation kant wrote influential modern treatises subject great achievement reason german vernunft able exercise kind universal lawmaking kant able therefore reformulate basis moralpractical theoretical aesthetic reasoning universal laws
practical reasoning selflegislating selfgoverning formulation universal norms theoretical reasoning humans posit universal laws nature25
practical reason moral autonomy freedom human beings depends ability behave according laws given proper exercise reason contrasted earlier forms morality depended religious understanding interpretation nature substance26
according kant free society individual must able pursue goals however long actions conform principles given reason formulated principle called categorical imperative would justify action could universalized

according maxim whereby time become universal law27

contrast hume kant insists reason german vernunft natural ends solution metaphysical problems especially discovery foundations morality kant claimed problem could solved transcendental logic unlike normal logic instrument used indifferently aristotle theoretical science right basis others28
according jürgen habermas substantive unity reason dissolved modern times longer answer question live instead unity reason strictly formal procedural thus described reason group three autonomous spheres model kants three critiques

cognitiveinstrumental reason kind reason employed sciences used observe events predict control outcomes intervene world basis hypotheses
moralpractical reason deliberate discuss issues moral political realm according universalizable procedures similar kants categorical imperative
aesthetic reason typically found works literature encompasses novel ways seeing world interpreting things practices embody

habermas three spheres domain experts therefore need mediated lifeworld philosophers drawing picture reason habermas hoped demonstrate substantive unity reason premodern societies able answer questions good life could made unity reasons formalizable procedures29
critique reasonedit
hamann herder kant hegel kierkegaard nietzsche heidegger foucault rorty many philosophers contributed debate reason means ought mean like kierkegaard nietzsche rorty skeptical subjectcentred universal instrumental reason even skeptical toward reason whole others including hegel believe obscured importance intersubjectivity spirit human life attempt reconstruct model reason
thinkers foucault believe forms reason neglected essential modern life understanding means live life according reason11
last several decades number proposals made reorient critique reason recognize voices departments reason
example opposition subjectcentred reason habermas proposed model communicative reason sees essentially cooperative activity based fact linguistic intersubjectivity30
nikolas kompridis proposed widely encompassing view reason ensemble practices contributes opening preserving openness human affairs focus reasons possibilities social change31
philosopher charles taylor influenced 20th century german philosopher martin heidegger proposed reason ought include faculty disclosure tied make sense things everyday life department reason32

deductive reasoningedit
main article deductive reasoning
subdivision philosophy logic logic study reasoning deduction form reasoning conclusion follows necessarily stated premises deduction also conclusion reached deductive reasoning process classic example deductive reasoning found syllogisms like following

reasoning argument valid premises could true conclusion false
inductive reasoningedit
main article inductive reasoning
induction form inference producing propositions unobserved objects types either specifically generally based previous observation used ascribe properties relations objects types based previous observations experiences formulate general statements laws based limited observations recurring phenomenal patterns
inductive reasoning contrasts strongly deductive reasoning even best strongest cases inductive reasoning truth premises guarantee truth conclusion instead conclusion inductive argument follows degree probability relatedly conclusion inductive argument contains information already contained premises thus method reasoning ampliative

empiricism sometimes associated aristotle65 correctly associated british philosophers john locke david hume well ancient equivalents democritus asserts sensory impressions available starting points reasoning attempting attain truth approach always leads controversial conclusion absolute knowledge attainable idealism associated plato school claims higher reality certain people directly arrive truth without needing rely upon senses higher reality therefore primary source truth
philosophers plato aristotle alfarabi avicenna averroes maimonides aquinas hegel sometimes said argued reason must fixed discoverable—perhaps dialectic analysis study vision thinkers reason divine least divine attributes approach allowed religious philosophers thomas aquinas étienne gilson show reason revelation compatible according hegel thought philosophy brings contemplation history simple conception reason reason sovereign world history world therefore presents rational process66

competing theories concerning origins reason relevant political ethical thought according aristotelian theory best living together exists independently historical circumstances according rousseau even doubt reason language politics good thing opposed simply best option given particular course events lead today rousseaus theory human nature malleable rather fixed often taken imply example karl marx wider range possible ways living together traditionally known
