authoritarian government states
linz distinguished forms authoritarianism personalistic dictatorships totalitarian states taking francoist spain example unlike personalistic dictatorships forms authoritarianism institutionalized representation variety actors spains case including military catholic church falange monarchists technocrats others unlike totalitarian states regime relies passive mass acceptance rather popular support4
several subtypes authoritarian regimes identified linz others5 linz identified basic subtypes traditional authoritarian regimes bureaucraticmilitary authoritarian regimes

traditional authoritarian regimes ruling authority generally single person maintained power combination appeals traditional legitimacy patronclient ties repression carried apparatus bound ruling authority personal loyalties example ethiopia haile selassie
bureaucraticmilitary authoritarian regimes governed coalition military officers technocrats pragmatically rather ideologically within limits bureaucratic mentality5 mark gasiorowski suggests best distinguish simple military authoritarian regimes bureaucratic authoritarian regimes powerful group technocrats uses state apparatus rationalize develop economy south korea park chunghee5

linz also identified three subtypes authoritarian regime corporatist organicstatistic racial ethnic democracy posttotalitarian5

corporatist authoritarian regimes corporatism institutions used extensively state coopt demobilize powerful interest groups type studied extensively latin america5
racial ethnic democracies certain racial ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights others largely entirely denied rights south africa apartheid5
posttotalitarian authoritarian regimes totalitarian institutions party secret police statecontrolled mass media remain ideological orthodoxy declined favor routinization repression declined states leadership less personalized secure level mass mobilization declined substantially5 examples include russian federation soviet eastern bloc states mid1980s5

authoritarian regimes also sometimes subcategorized whether personalistic populist5 personalistic authoritarian regimes characterized arbitrary rule authority exercised mainly patronage networks coercion rather institutions formal rules5 personalistic authoritarian regimes seen postcolonial africa contrast populist authoritarian regimes mobilizational regimes strong charismatic manipulative leader rules coalition involving lowerclass groups5 examples include argentina perón5 egypt nasser5 venezuela chávez maduro67
authoritarianism characterized highly concentrated centralized power maintained political repression exclusion potential challengers uses political parties mass organizations mobilize people around goals regime8 adam przeworski theorized authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly lies fear economic prosperity9
authoritarianism also tends embrace informal unregulated exercise political power leadership selfappointed even elected cannot displaced citizens free choice among competitors arbitrary deprivation civil liberties little tolerance meaningful opposition8
range social controls also attempt stifle civil society10 political stability maintained control support armed forces bureaucracy staffed regime creation allegiance various means socialization indoctrination8
authoritarian political systems weakened inadequate performance demands people8 vestal writes tendency respond challenges authoritarianism tighter control instead adaptation significant weakness overly rigid approach fails adapt changes accommodate growing demands part populace even groups within system8 legitimacy state dependent performance authoritarian states fail adapt collapse8

sondrol argues authoritarianism totalitarianism forms autocracy differ dichotomies

unlike bland generally unpopular authoritarian brethren totalitarian dictators develop charismatic mystique massbased pseudodemocratic interdependence followers conscious manipulation prophetic image
concomitant role conceptions differentiate totalitarians authoritarians authoritarians view individual beings largely content control often maintain status totalitarian selfconceptions largely teleological tyrant less person indispensable function guide reshape universe
consequently utilisation power personal aggrandizement evident among authoritarians totalitarians lacking binding appeal ideology authoritarians support rule mixture instilling fear granting rewards loyal collaborators engendering kleptocracy13
