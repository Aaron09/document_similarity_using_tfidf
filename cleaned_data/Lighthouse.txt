modern constructionedit
modern lighthouses began turn 18th century lighthouse construction boomed lockstep burgeoning levels transatlantic commerce advances structural engineering efficient lighting equipment allowed creation larger powerful lighthouses including ones exposed function lighthouses shifted toward provision visible warning shipping hazards rocks reefs

eddystone rocks major shipwreck hazard mariners sailing english channel1 first lighthouse built octagonal wooden structure anchored iron stanchions secured rock built henry winstanley 1696 1698 lighthouse first tower world fully exposed open sea2
civil engineer john smeaton rebuilt lighthouse 1756–593 tower marked major step forward design lighthouses remained 1877 modelled shape lighthouse tree using granite blocks rediscovered used hydraulic lime form concrete water used romans developed technique securing granite blocks together using dovetail joints marble dowels4 dovetailing feature served improve structural stability although smeaton also taper thickness tower towards curved tower inwards gentle gradient profile added advantage allowing energy waves dissipate impact walls lighthouse prototype modern lighthouse influenced subsequent engineers5




john smeatons rebuilt version eddystone lighthouse 1759 represented great step forward lighthouse design

lighting improvementsedit
source illumination generally wood pyres burning coal argand lamp invented 1782 swiss scientist aimé argand revolutionized lighthouse illumination steady smokeless flame early models used ground glass sometimes tinted around wick later models used mantle thorium dioxide suspended flame creating bright steady light9 argand lamp used whale colza olive oil10 vegetable fuel supplied gravity feed reservoir mounted burner lamp first produced matthew boulton partnership argand 1784 became standard lighthouses century
south foreland lighthouse first tower successfully electric light 1875 lighthouses carbon lamps powered steamdriven magneto11 john richardson wigham first develop system illumination lighthouses improved crocus burner baily lighthouse near dublin times powerful brilliant light known12

vaporized burner invented 1901 arthur kitson improved david hood trinity house fuel vaporized high pressure burned heat mantle giving output times luminosity traditional lights illuminant became widely available invention dalén light swedish engineer gustaf dalén used agamassan substrate absorb allowing safe storage hence commercial exploitation dalén also invented valve automatically regulated light turned daytime technology predominant form light source lighthouses 1900s 1960s electric lighting become dominant13
optical systemsedit




diagram depicting spherical fresnel lens collimates light


development steady illumination argand lamp application optical lenses increase focus light intensity became practical possibility william hutchinson developed first practical optical system 1763 known catoptric system rudimentary system effectively collimated emitted light concentrated beam thereby greatly increasing lights visibility14 ability focus light first revolving lighthouse beams light would appear mariners series intermittent flashes also became possible transmit complex signals using light flashes
french physicist engineer augustinjean fresnel developed multipart fresnel lens lighthouses design allowed construction lenses large aperture short focal length without mass volume material would required lens conventional design fresnel lens made much thinner comparable conventional lens cases taking form flat sheet fresnel lens also capture oblique light light source thus allowing light lighthouse equipped visible greater distances
first fresnel lens used 1823 cordouan lighthouse mouth gironde estuary light could seen miles out15 fresnel’s invention increased luminosity lighthouse lamp factor system still common

lighthouse source light called lamp whether electric fueled concentration light lens optic originally open fires later candles argand hollow wick lamp parabolic reflector introduced late 18th century

concentration light accomplished rotating lens assembly early lighthouses light source kerosene lamp earlier animal vegetable argand lamp lenses rotated weight driven clockwork assembly wound lighthouse keepers sometimes often every hours lens assembly sometimes floated liquid mercury reduce friction modern lighthouses electric lights motor drives used generally powered diesel electric generators also supplied electricity lighthouse keepers18
efficiently concentrating light large omnidirectional light source requires large diameter lens would require thick heavy lens conventional lens used fresnel lens pronounced freɪˈnɛl focused lamps light versus focused parabolic reflectors time design enabled construction lenses large size short focal length without weight volume material conventional lens designs23
fresnel lighthouse lenses ranked order measure refracting power first order lens largest powerful expensive sixth order lens smallest order based focal length lens first order lens longest focal length sixth shortest coastal lighthouses generally first second third order lenses harbor lights beacons fourth fifth sixth order lenses24

preservationedit
lighthouses became less essential navigation many historic structures faced demolition neglect united states national historic lighthouse preservation 2000 provides transfer lighthouse structures local governments private nonprofit groups uscg continues maintain lamps lenses canada nova scotia lighthouse preservation society heritage status sambro island lighthouse sponsored heritage lighthouse protection change canadian federal laws protect lighthouses33
many groups formed restore save lighthouses around world include world lighthouse society united states lighthouse society34 international group amateur radio lighthouse society sends amateur radio operators publicize preservation remote lighthouses throughout world35
