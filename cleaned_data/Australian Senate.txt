australian senate 1923


commonwealth australia constitution 1900 established senate part system dominion government newly federated australia comparative governmental perspective australian senate exhibits distinctive characteristics unlike upper houses westminster system governments senate vestigial body limited legislative power rather intended play play active role legislation rather modelled solely house lords canadian senate australian senate part modelled united states senate giving equal representation state equal powers2 constitution intended give less populous states added voice federal legislature also providing revising role upper house westminster system
although prime minister treasurer convention members house representatives john gorton appointed prime minister 1968 resigned senate elected house members cabinet come either house3 houses almost equal legislative power2 upper chambers bicameral parliaments senate cannot introduce amend appropriation bills bills authorise government expenditure public revenue bills impose taxation role reserved lower house approve reject defer degree equality senate house representatives reflects desire constitutions authors address smaller states desire strong powers senate ensuring interests populous states represented house representatives totally dominate government situation also partly australian constitution enacted confrontation 1909 britain house commons house lords ultimately resulted restrictions placed powers house lords parliament acts 1911 1949

proportional representation small majorities senate compared generally larger majorities house representatives requirement number members house nearly practicable twice senate joint sitting double dissolution likely lead victory house senate senate number senators retiring election vote would lead clear majority state even number senators retiring election takes vote seats insurmountable gives house unintended extra advantage joint sittings ordinary elections senate evenly balanced house legislation

constitutional text denies senate power originate amend appropriation bills deference conventions classical westminster system traditional westminster system executive government responsible public funds lower house power bring government blocking access supply revenue appropriated taxation arrangement expressed australian constitution however still leaves senate power reject supply bills defer passage undoubtedly senates powerful abilities
ability block supply exercised 1975 australian constitutional crisis opposition used numbers senate defer supply bills refusing deal election called houses parliament election hoped prime minister gough whitlam contested legitimacy blocking refused resign crisis brought head westminster conventions australian constitutional system conflict firstly government continue govern long support lower house secondly government longer access supply must either resign dismissed crisis resolved november 1975 governorgeneral john kerr dismissed whitlams government appointed caretaker government condition elections houses parliament held35 action source controversy debate time proper usage senates ability block supply
