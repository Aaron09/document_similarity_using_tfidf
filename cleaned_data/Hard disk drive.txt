error rates handlingedit
modern drives make extensive error correction codes eccs particularly reed–solomon error correction techniques store extra bits determined mathematical formulas block data extra bits allow many errors corrected invisibly extra bits take space allow higher recording densities employed without causing uncorrectable errors resulting much larger storage capacity50 example typical hard disk 512byte sectors provides additional capacity data51
newest drives 200952 lowdensity paritycheck codes ldpc supplanting reed–solomon ldpc codes enable performance close shannon limit thus provide highest storage density available5253
