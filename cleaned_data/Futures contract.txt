risk mitigationedit
although futures contracts oriented towards future time point main purpose mitigate risk default either party intervening period vein futures exchange requires parties initial cash performance bond known margin margins sometimes percentage value futures contract must maintained throughout life contract guarantee agreement time price contract vary function supply demand causing side exchange lose money expense
mitigate risk default product marked market daily basis difference initial agreedupon price actual daily futures price reevaluated daily sometimes known variation margin futures exchange draw money losing partys margin account party ensuring correct loss profit reflected daily
margin account goes certain value exchange margin call made account owner must replenish margin account process known marking market thus delivery date amount exchanged specified price contract spot value since gain loss already previously settled marking market upon marketing strike price often reached creates lots income caller

arbitrage argumentsedit
arbitrage arguments rational pricing apply deliverable asset exists plentiful supply freely created forward price represents expected future value underlying discounted risk free rate—as deviation theoretical price afford investors riskless profit opportunity arbitraged away define forward price strike contract value present time assuming interest rates constant forward price futures equal forward price forward contract strike maturity also underlying asset uncorrelated interest rates otherwise difference forward price futures futures price forward price asset proportional covariance underlying asset price interest rates example futures zero coupon bond futures price lower forward price called futures convexity correction
thus assuming constant rates simple nondividend paying asset value futuresforward price found compounding present value time maturity rate riskfree return

futures tradersedit
futures traders traditionally placed groups hedgers interest underlying asset could include intangible index interest rate seeking hedge risk price changes speculators seek make profit predicting market moves opening derivative contract related asset paper practical intent actually take make delivery underlying asset words investor seeking exposure asset long futures opposite effect short futures contract
hedgersedit
hedgers typically include producers consumers commodity owner asset assets subject certain influences interest rate
example traditional commodity markets farmers often sell futures contracts crops livestock produce guarantee certain price making easier plan similarly livestock producers often purchase futures cover feed costs plan fixed cost feed modern financial markets producers interest rate swaps equity derivative products financial futures equity index futures reduce remove risk swap
sell commodity futures need careful company buys contracts hedging price increases fact market price commodity substantially lower time delivery could find disastrously noncompetitive example verasun energy
speculatorsedit
speculators typically fall three categories position traders traders swing traders swing trading though many hybrid types unique styles exist many investors pouring futures markets recent years controversy risen whether speculators responsible increased volatility commodities like experts divided matter
example hedge speculative notions involves mutual fund separately managed account whose investment objective track performance stock index stock index portfolio manager often equitizes cash inflows easy cost effective manner investing opening long stock index futures gains portfolio exposure index consistent fund account investment objective without appropriate proportion individual stocks also preserves balanced diversification maintains higher degree percent assets invested market helps reduce tracking error performance fundaccount economically feasible efficient amount shares every individual position within fund account purchased portfolio manager close contract make purchases individual stock
social utility futures markets considered mainly transfer risk increased liquidity traders different risk time preferences hedger speculator example1
options futuresedit
many cases options traded futures sometimes called simply futures options option sell futures contract call option futures contract option strike price specified futures price future traded option exercised futures often used since delta instruments calls options futures priced similarly traded assets using extension blackscholes formula namely black–scholes model futures options futures premium unwound positions commonly referred fution like options however settle like futures
investors either take role option seller writer option buyer option sellers generally seen taking risk contractually obligated take opposite futures position options buyer exercises right futures position specified option price option determined supply demand principles consists option premium price paid option seller offering option taking risk14

forward contractsedit
closely related contract forward contract forward like futures specifies exchange goods specified price specified future date however forward traded exchange thus interim partial payments marking market contract standardized exchange
unlike option parties futures contract must fulfill contract delivery date seller delivers underlying asset buyer cashsettled futures contract cash transferred futures trader sustained loss made profit exit commitment prior settlement date holder futures position close contract obligations taking opposite position another futures contract asset settlement date difference futures prices profit loss
futures versus forwardsedit
futures forward contracts contracts deliver asset future date prearranged price different main respects

futures exchangetraded forwards traded overthecounter

thus futures standardized face exchange forwards customized face nonexchange counterparty


futures margined forwards

thus futures significantly less credit risk different funding



forwards credit risk futures clearing house guarantees default risk taking sides trade marking market positions every night forwards basically unregulated futures contracts regulated federal government level
futures industry association estimates billion futures contracts traded 2007 increase nearly 2006 figure
exchange versus otcedit
futures always traded exchange whereas forwards always trade overthecounter simply signed contract parties therefore

futures highly standardized exchangetraded whereas forwards unique overthecounter
case physical delivery forward contract specifies make delivery counterparty delivery futures contract chosen clearing house

marginingedit
details margin margin finance
futures margined daily daily spot price forward agreedupon delivery price underlying asset based mark market
forwards standard transact settlement date typical would parties agree true example every quarter fact forwards margined daily means movements price underlying asset large differential build forwards delivery price settlement price event unrealized gain loss build
differs futures truedup typically daily comparison market value future collateral securing contract keep line brokerage margin requirements trueing occurs loss party providing additional collateral buyer contract incurs drop value shortfall variation margin would typically shored investor wiring depositing additional cash brokerage account
forward though spread exchange rates trued regularly rather builds unrealized gain loss depending side trade discussed means entire unrealized gain loss becomes realized time delivery typically occurs time contract closed prior expiration—assuming parties must transact underlying currencys spot price facilitate receiptdelivery
result forwards higher credit risk futures funding charged differently
cases involving institutional investors daily variation margin settlement guidelines futures call actual money movement insignificant amount avoid wiring back forth small sums cash threshold amount daily futures variation margin institutional investors often 1000
situation forwards however daily trueup takes place turn creates credit risk forwards much futures simply risk forward contract supplier unable deliver referenced asset buyer unable delivery date date opening party closes contract
margining futures eliminates much credit risk forcing holders update daily price equivalent forward purchased means usually little additional money final settle futures contract final days gain loss gain loss life contract
addition daily futuressettlement failure risk borne exchange rather individual party limiting credit risk futures
example consider futures contract price lets futures contract delivery price underlying asset future costs futures contract costs means marktomarket calculation would requires holder side future track changes forward price post margin money goes margin accounts holder side future loss party wires cash party
forwardholder however nothing settlement final potentially building large balance reflected mark allowance credit risk except tiny effects convexity bias earning paying interest margin futures forwards equal delivery prices result total loss gain holders futures experience lossgain daily increments track forwards daily price changes forwards spot price converges settlement price thus mark market accounting assets gain loss accrues holding period futures gain loss realized daily forward contract gain loss remains unrealized expiry
note path dependence funding futures contract strictly speaking europeanstyle derivative total gain loss trade depends value underlying asset expiry also path prices difference generally quite small though
exchangetraded future clearing house interposes every trade thus risk counterparty default risk clearing house defaults become bankrupt considered unlikely
