megabit chip last models developed carl zeiss jena 1989


early computers used relays mechanical counters3 delay lines main memory functions ultrasonic delay lines could reproduce data order written drum memory could expanded relatively cost efficient retrieval memory items required knowledge physical layout drum optimize speed latches built vacuum tube triodes later discrete transistors used smaller faster memories registers registers relatively large costly large amounts data generally dozen hundred bits memory could provided
first practical form randomaccess memory williams tube starting 1947 stored data electrically charged spots face cathode tube since electron beam could read write spots tube order memory random access capacity williams tube hundred around thousand bits much smaller faster powerefficient using individual vacuum tube latches developed university manchester england williams tube provided medium first electronically storedmemory program implemented manchester smallscale experimental machine ssem computer first successfully program june 19484 fact rather williams tube memory designed ssem ssem testbed demonstrate reliability memory56
magneticcore memory invented 1947 developed mid1970s became widespread form randomaccess memory relying array magnetized rings changing sense rings magnetization data could stored stored ring since every ring combination address wires select read write access memory location sequence possible
magnetic core memory standard form memory system displaced solidstate memory integrated circuits starting early 1970s dynamic randomaccess memory dram allowed replacement 6transistor latch circuit single transistor memory greatly increasing memory density cost volatility data stored tiny capacitance transistor periodically refreshed every milliseconds charge could leak away toshiba toscal bc1411 electronic calculator introduced 196578 used form dram built discrete components8 dram developed robert dennard 1968

types randomaccess memory
widely used forms modern static sram dynamic dram sram data stored using state transistor memory cell form expensive produce generally faster requires less dynamic power dram modern computers sram often used cache memory dram stores data using transistor capacitor pair together comprise dram cell capacitor holds high charge respectively transistor acts switch lets control circuitry chip read capacitors state charge change form memory less expensive produce static predominant form computer memory used modern computers
static dynamic considered volatile state lost reset power removed system contrast readonly memory stores data permanently enabling disabling selected transistors memory cannot altered writeable variants eeprom flash memory share properties enabling data persist without power updated without requiring special equipment persistent forms semiconductor include flash drives memory cards cameras portable devices solidstate drives memory either sram dram includes special circuitry detect andor correct random faults memory errors stored data using parity bits error correction codes
general term refers solely solidstate memory devices either dram sram specifically main memory computers optical storage term dvdram somewhat misnomer since unlike cdrw dvdrw need erased reuse nevertheless dvdram behaves much like hard disc drive somewhat slower
memory cell
main article memory cell computing
memory cell fundamental building block computer memory memory cell electronic circuit stores binary information must store logic high voltage level reset store logic voltage level value maintainedstored changed setreset process value memory cell accessed reading
sram memory cell type flipflop circuit usually implemented using fets means sram requires power accessed expensive storage density
second type dram based around capacitor charging discharging capacitor store cell however charge capacitor slowly leaks away must refreshed periodically refresh process dram uses power achieve greater storage densities lower unit costs compared sram

addressing
useful memory cells must readable writeable within device multiplexing demultiplexing circuitry used select memory cells typically device address lines combination bits applied lines memory cells activated addressing devices virtually always memory capacity power
usually several memory cells share address example wide chip memory cells address often width memory microprocessor different microprocessor eight chips would needed
often addresses needed provided device case external multiplexors device used activate correct device accessed
memory hierarchy
main article memory hierarchy
read overwrite data many computer systems memory hierarchy consisting processor registers ondie sram caches external caches dram paging systems virtual memory swap space hard drive entire pool memory referred many developers even though various subsystems different access times violating original concept behind random access term even within hierarchy level dram specific column bank rank channel interleave organization components make access time variable although extent access time rotating storage media tape variable overall goal using memory hierarchy obtain highest possible average access performance minimizing total cost entire memory system generally memory hierarchy follows access time fast registers slow hard drive bottom
many modern personal computers comes easily upgraded form modules called memory modules dram modules size sticks chewing quickly replaced become damaged changing needs demand storage capacity suggested smaller amounts mostly sram also integrated motherboard well harddrives cdroms several parts computer system

modern operating systems employ method extending capacity known virtual memory portion computers hard drive aside paging file scratch partition combination physical paging file form systems total memory example computer page file operating system total memory available system runs physical memory swap portions paging file make room data well read previously swapped information back excessive mechanism results thrashing generally hampers overall system performance mainly hard drives slower
disk
main article drive

shadow
sometimes contents relatively slow chip copied readwrite memory allow shorter access times chip disabled initialized memory locations switched block addresses often writeprotected process sometimes called shadowing fairly common computers embedded systems
common example bios typical personal computers often option called “use shadow bios” similar enabled functions rely data bios’s instead dram locations also toggle shadowing video card sections depending system result increased performance cause incompatibilities example hardware inaccessible operating system shadow used systems benefit hypothetical bios used booting favor direct hardware access free memory reduced size shadowed roms9

“first chip geometries shrink clock frequencies rise transistor leakage current increases leading excess power consumption heat secondly advantages higher clock speeds part negated memory latency since memory access times able keep pace increasing clock frequencies third certain applications traditional serial architectures becoming less efficient processors faster socalled neumann bottleneck undercutting gains frequency increases might otherwise addition partly limitations means producing inductance within solid state devices resistancecapacitance delays signal transmission growing feature sizes shrink imposing additional bottleneck frequency increases dont address”
