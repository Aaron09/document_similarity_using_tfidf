main article herbivore adaptations plant defense
myriad defenses displayed plants means herbivores need variety skills overcome defenses obtain food allow herbivores increase feeding host plant herbivores three primary strategies dealing plant defenses choice herbivore modification plant modification
feeding choice involves plants herbivore chooses consume suggested many herbivores feed variety plants balance nutrient uptake avoid consuming much type defensive chemical involves tradeoff however foraging many plant species avoid toxins specializing type plant detoxified28
herbivore modification various adaptations body digestive systems herbivore allow overcome plant defenses might include detoxifying secondary metabolites29 sequestering toxins unaltered30 avoiding toxins production large amounts saliva reduce effectiveness defenses herbivores also utilize symbionts evade plant defences example aphids bacteria provide essential amino acids lacking diet31
plant modification occurs herbivores manipulate plant prey increase feeding example caterpillars roll leaves reduce effectiveness plant defenses activated sunlight32
plant defense
main article plant defense herbivory
also plant tolerance herbivory
plant defense trait increases plant fitness faced herbivory measured relative another plant lacks defensive trait plant defenses increase survival andor reproduction fitness plants pressure predation herbivorescitation needed
defense divided main categories tolerance resistance tolerance ability plant withstand damage without reduction fitness occur diverting herbivory nonessential plant parts rapid regrowth recovery herbivory resistance refers ability plant reduce amount damage receives herbivore occur avoidance space time33 physical defenses chemical defenses defenses either constitutive always present plant induced produced translocated plant following damage stress34
physical mechanical defenses barriers structures designed deter herbivores reduce intake rates lowering overall herbivory thorns found roses acacia trees example spines cactus smaller hairs known trichomes cover leaves stems especially effective invertebrate herbivores35 addition plants waxes resins alter texture making difficult also incorporation silica cell walls analogous role lignin compressionresistant structural component cell walls plants cell walls impregnated silica thereby afforded measure protection herbivory36
chemical defenses secondary metabolites produced plant deter herbivory wide variety nature single plant hundreds different chemical defenses chemical defenses divided main groups carbonbased defenses nitrogenbased defensescitation needed

carbonbased defenses include terpenes phenolics terpenes derived 5carbon isoprene units comprise essential oils carotenoids resins latex number functions disrupt herbivores inhibiting adenosine triphosphate formation molting hormones nervous system37 phenolics combine aromatic carbon ring hydroxyl group number different phenolics lignins found cell walls indigestible except specialized microorganisms tannins bitter taste bind proteins making indigestible furanocumerins produce free radicals disrupting protein lipids cause skin irritation
nitrogenbased defenses synthesized amino acids primarily come form alkaloids cyanogens alkaloids include commonly recognized substances caffeine nicotine morphine compounds often bitter inhibit synthesis block nervous system signal transmission cyanogens name cyanide stored within tissues released plant damaged inhibits cellular respiration electron transportcitation needed

plants also changed features enhance probability attracting natural enemies herbivores emit semiochemicals odors attract natural enemies others provide food housing maintain natural enemies’ presence ants reduce herbivory38 given plant species often many types defensive mechanisms mechanical chemical constitutive induced allow escape herbivorescitation needed
herbivore–plant interactions predator–prey theory
according theory predator–prey interactions relationship herbivores plants cyclic39 prey plants numerous predators herbivores increase numbers reducing prey population turn causes predator number decline40 prey population eventually recovers starting cycle suggests population herbivore fluctuates around carrying capacity food source case plant
several factors play fluctuating populations help stabilize predator–prey dynamics example spatial heterogeneity maintained means always pockets plants found herbivores stabilizing dynamic plays especially important role specialist herbivores feed species plant prevents specialists wiping food source41 prey defenses also help stabilize predator–prey dynamics information relationships section plant defenses eating second prey type helps herbivores’ populations stabilize42 alternating plant types provides population stability herbivore populations plants oscillate43 plays important role generalist herbivores variety plants keystone herbivores keep vegetation populations check allow greater diversity herbivores plants42 invasive herbivore plant enters system balance thrown diversity collapse monotaxon system42
back forth relationship plant defense herbivore offense seen sort adaptation dance partner makes move counters it29 reciprocal change drives coevolution many plants herbivores resulting referred coevolutionary arms race44 escape radiation mechanisms coevolution presents idea adaptations herbivores host plants driving force behind speciation4546
much interaction herbivory plant defense negative individual reducing fitness actually beneficial beneficial herbivory takes form mutualisms partners benefit interaction seed dispersal herbivores pollination forms mutualistic herbivory herbivore receives food resource plant aided reproduction47
