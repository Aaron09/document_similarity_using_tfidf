uniform resource locators defined 1738 1994 bernerslee inventor world wide working group internet engineering task force ietf6 outcome collaboration started ietf living documents birds feather session 199278
format combines preexisting system domain names created 1985 file path syntax slashes used separate directory filenames conventions already existed server names could prefixed complete file paths preceded double slash
bernerslee later expressed regret dots separate parts domain name within uris wishing used slashes throughout9 also said given colon following first component slashes domain name unnecessary10

every http conforms syntax generic generic form

schemeuserpasswordhostportpathqueryfragment

comprises

scheme consisting sequence characters beginning letter followed combination letters digits plus period hyphen although schemes caseinsensitive canonical form lowercase documents specify schemes must lowercase letters followed colon examples popular schemes include https mailto file data schemes registered internet assigned numbers authority iana although nonregistered schemes used practiceb
slashes required schemes required others authority component explained absent path component cannot begin slashes14
authority part comprising

optional authentication section user name password separated colon followed symbol
host consisting either registered name including limited hostname address ipv4 addresses must dotdecimal notation ipv6 addresses must enclosed brackets
optional port number separated hostname colon


path contains data usually organized hierarchical form appears sequence segments separated slashes sequence resemble exactly file system path always imply relation one17 path must begin single slash authority part present also must begin double slash path always defined though defined path empty zero length therefore trailing slash



query delimiter

key1value1key2value2



optional query separated preceding part question mark containing query string nonhierarchical data syntax well defined convention often sequence attribute–value pairs separated delimiter
optional fragment separated preceding part hash fragment contains fragment identifier providing direction secondary resource section heading article identified remainder primary resource html document fragment often attribute specific element browsers scroll element view

browser usually dereference performing http request specified host default port number urls using https scheme require requests responses made secure connection website
internationalized
internet users distributed throughout world using wide variety languages alphabets expect able create urls local alphabets internationalized resource identifier form includes unicode characters modern browsers support iris parts requiring special treatment different alphabets domain name path1920
domain name known internationalized domain name internet software automatically convert domain name punycode usable domain name system example chinese http例子卷筒纸 becomes httpxnfsqu00axn3lr804guic indicates character originally ascii21
path name also specified user local writing system already encoded converted utf8 characters part basic character escaped hexadecimal using percentencoding example japanese httpexamplecom引き割りhtml becomes httpexamplecome5bc95e3818de589b2e3828ahtml target computer decodes address displays page19
