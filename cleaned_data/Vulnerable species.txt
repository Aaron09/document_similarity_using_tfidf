criteriaedit
international union conservation nature uses several criteria enter species category taxon vulnerable critically endangered endangered facing high risk extinction wild mediumterm future defined following criteria
population reduction form either following

observed estimated inferred suspected reduction least last years three generations whichever longer based specifying following

direct observation
index abundance appropriate taxon
decline area occupancy extent occurrence quality habitat
actual potential levels exploitation
effects introduced taxa hybridisation pathogens pollutants competitors parasites


reduction least projected suspected within next years three generations whichever longer based specifying

extent occurrence estimated less 20000 area occupancy estimated less 2000 estimates indicating following

severely fragmented known exist locations
continuing decline inferred observed projected following

extent occurrence
area occupancy
area extent quality habitat
number locations subpopulations
number mature individuals


extreme fluctuations following

extent occurrence
area occupancy
number locations subpopulations
number mature individuals



population estimated number fewer 10000 mature individuals either

estimated continuing decline least within years three generations whichever longer
continuing decline observed projected inferred numbers mature individuals population structure form either

severely fragmented subpopulation estimated contain 1000 mature individuals
individuals single subpopulation



population small restricted form either following

population estimated number less 1000 mature individuals
population characterised acute restriction area occupancy typically less number locations typically less five taxon would thus prone effects human activities stochastic events whose impact increased human activities within short period time unforeseeable future thus capable becoming critically endangered even extinct short period

quantitative analysis showing probability extinction wild least within years
