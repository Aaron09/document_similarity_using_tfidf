information informs words answer question kind thus related data knowledge data represents values attributed parameters knowledge signifies understanding real things abstract concepts1 regards data informations existence necessarily coupled observer exists beyond event horizon example case knowledge information requires cognitive observer2
information conveyed either content message direct indirect observation anything perceived construed message right sense information always conveyed content message
information encoded various forms transmission interpretation example information encoded sequence signs transmitted sequence signals also encrypted safe storage communication
information reduces uncertainty uncertainty event measured probability occurrence inversely proportional uncertain event information required resolve uncertainty event typical unit information units used example information encoded fair coin flip log221 fair coin flips log241 bits
concept information message different meanings different contexts3 thus concept information becomes closely related notions constraint communication control data form education knowledge meaning understanding mental stimuli pattern perception representation entropy

etymologyedit
also history word concept information
english word apparently derives latin stem information nominative informatio noun derives verb informare inform sense give form mind discipline instruct teach inform comes french informer latin verb informare means give form form idea furthermore latin already contained word informatio meaning concept idea extent influenced development word information english clear
ancient greek word form μορφή morphe morph also εἶδος eidos kind idea shape latter word famously used technical philosophical sense plato later aristotle denote ideal identity essence something theory forms eidos also associated thought proposition even concept
ancient greek word information πληροφορία transliterates plērophoria πλήρης plērēs fully φέρω phorein frequentative pherein carry literally means bears fully conveys fully modern greek word πληροφορία still daily meaning word information english addition primary meaning word πληροφορία symbol deep roots aristotles semiotic triangle regard interpreted communicate information decoding specific type sign something occurs frequently etymology many words ancient modern greek strong denotative relationship signifier word symbol conveys specific encoded interpretation signified concept whose meaning interpreter attempts decode
information theory approachedit
main article information theory
stance information theory information taken ordered sequence symbols alphabet input alphabet output alphabet information processing consists inputoutput function maps input sequence output sequence mapping probabilistic deterministic memory memoryless4
sensory inputedit
often information viewed type input organism system inputs kinds inputs important function organism example food system energy book sensory ecology5 dusenbery called causal inputs inputs information important associated causal inputs used predict occurrence causal input later time perhaps another place information important association information eventually must connection causal input practice information usually carried weak stimuli must detected specialized sensory systems amplified energy inputs functional organism system example light mainly plants grow direction lightsource causal input plants animals provides information colored light reflected flower weak much photosynthetic work visual system detects bees nervous system uses information guide flower often finds nectar pollen causal inputs serving nutritional function
representation complexityedit
cognitive scientist applied mathematician ronaldo vigo argues information concept requires least related entities make quantitative sense dimensionally defined category objects subsets essence representation words conveys representational hence conceptual information vigo defines amount information conveys rate change complexity whenever objects removed vigo information pattern invariance complexity representation information—five fundamental constructs universal science—are unified novel mathematical framework678 among things framework aims overcome limitations shannonweaver information attempting characterize measure subjective information
influence leads transformationedit
information type pattern influences formation transformation patterns910 sense need conscious mind perceive much less appreciate patterncitation needed consider example sequence nucleotides pattern influences formation development organism without need conscious mind might argue though human consciously define pattern example nucleotide naturally involves conscious information processing
systems theory times seems refer information sense assuming information necessarily involve conscious mind patterns circulating feedback system called information words said information sense something potentially perceived representation though created presented purpose example gregory bateson defines information difference makes difference11
however premise influence implies information perceived conscious mind also interpreted specific context associated interpretation cause transformation information knowledge complex definitions information knowledge make semantic logical analysis difficult condition transformation important point study information relates knowledge especially business discipline knowledge management practice tools processes used assist knowledge worker performing research making decisions including steps

review information effectively derive value meaning
reference metadata available
establish relevant context often many possible contexts
derive knowledge information
make decisions recommendations resulting knowledge

stewart 2001 argues transformation information knowledge critical lying core value creation competitive advantage modern enterprise
