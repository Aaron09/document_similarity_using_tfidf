order seek consultation consent nobility senior clergy major decisions postnorman conquest english monarchs called great councils typical great council would consist archbishops bishops abbots barons earls pillars feudal system
system consultation consent broke often became impossible government function effectively prominent instances prior reign henry disagreements thomas becket henry king john barons
becket served archbishop canterbury 1162 1170 murdered following long running dispute henry jurisdiction church john king 1199 1216 aroused hostility many leading noblemen forced agree magna carta 1215 johns refusal adhere charter civil first barons
