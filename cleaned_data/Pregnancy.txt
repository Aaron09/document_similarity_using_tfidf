common symptoms discomforts pregnancy include

tiredness

start gestational
main article gestational
according american congress obstetricians gynecologists main methods calculate gestational are25

directly calculating days since beginning last menstrual period
early obstetric ultrasound comparing size embryo fetus reference group pregnancies known gestational calculated last menstrual periods using mean gestational embryos fetuses size gestational calculated early ultrasound contradictory calculated directly last menstrual period still early ultrasound used rest pregnancy25
case vitro fertilization calculating days since oocyte retrieval coincubation adding days26

estimation date




distribution gestational childbirth among singleton live births given gestational estimated first trimester ultrasound directly last menstrual period27 roughly births occur weeks gestational


main article estimated date confinement
date estimation basically follows steps

determination time point used origin gestational described section
adding estimated gestational childbirth time point childbirth average occurs gestational days weeks therefore often used standard estimation individual pregnancies28 however alternative durations well individualized methods also suggested

naegeles rule standard calculating date pregnancy assuming gestational days childbirth rule estimates expected date delivery adding year subtracting three months adding seven days origin gestational alternatively mobile apps essentially always give consistent estimations compared correct leap year pregnancy wheels made paper differ days generally correct leap year29
furthermore actual childbirth certain probability occurring within limits estimated date study singleton live births came result childbirth standard deviation days gestational estimated first trimester ultrasound days estimated directly last menstrual period27

fertilization implantation humans


interplay hormones includes follicle stimulating hormone stimulates folliculogenesis oogenesis creates mature cell female gamete fertilization event cell fuses male gamete spermatozoon point fertilization fused product female male gamete referred zygote fertilized fusion male female gametes usually occurs following sexual intercourse fertilization also occur assisted reproductive technology artificial insemination vitro fertilisation

maternal changes
main article maternal physiological changes pregnancy




breast changes seen pregnancy areolae larger darker


pregnancy woman undergoes many physiological changes entirely normal including cardiovascular hematologic metabolic renal respiratory changes increases blood sugar breathing cardiac output required levels progesterone oestrogens rise continually throughout pregnancy suppressing hypothalamic axis therefore also menstrual cycle
fetus genetically different woman viewed unusually successful allograft34 main reason success increased immune tolerance pregnancy35 immune tolerance concept body able mount immune system response certain triggers34
pregnancy typically broken three periods trimesters three months3637 trimester defined weeks total duration weeks although average duration pregnancy weeks38 hard fast rules distinctions useful describing changes take place time
first trimester




uterus changes size duration trimesters


minute ventilation increases first trimester39 womb grow size lemon eight weeks many symptoms discomforts pregnancy like nausea tender breasts appear first trimester40
second trimester




second trimester expanding uterus created visible baby bump although breasts developing internally since beginning pregnancy visible changes appear point


weeks pregnancy called second trimester women feel energized period begin weight symptoms morning sickness subside eventually fade away uterus muscular organ holds developing fetus expand times normal size pregnancy
although fetus begins move first trimester second trimester movement often referred quickening felt typically happens fourth month specifically 20th 21st week 19th week woman pregnant common women feel fetus move much later second trimester women begin wear maternity clothes
third trimester




uterus expands making larger larger portion womans abdomen left anterior view months labeled right lateral view labeling last weeks final stages gestation childbirth fetus uterus drop lower position


final weight gain takes place weight gain throughout pregnancy womans abdomen transform shape drops fetus turning downward position ready birth second trimester womans abdomen would upright whereas third trimester drop fetus moves regularly felt woman fetal movement become strong disruptive woman womans navel sometimes become convex popping expanding abdomen
head engagement fetal head descends cephalic presentation relieves pressure upper abdomen renewed ease breathing also severely reduces bladder capacity increases pressure pelvic floor rectum
also third trimester maternal activity sleep positions affect fetal development restricted blood flow instance enlarged uterus impede blood flow compressing vena cava lying flat relieved lying left side41
childbirth
main article childbirth
childbirth referred labor delivery medical field process whereby infant born42
woman considered labour begins experiencing regular uterine contractions accompanied changes cervix primarily effacement dilation childbirth widely experienced painful women report painless labours others find concentrating birth helps quicken labour lessen sensations births successful vaginal births sometimes complications arise woman undergo cesarean section
