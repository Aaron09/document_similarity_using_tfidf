although modern biology relatively recent development sciences related included within studied since ancient times natural philosophy studied early ancient civilizations mesopotamia egypt indian subcontinent china however origins modern biology approach study nature often traced back ancient greece78 formal study medicine dates back hippocrates aristotle contributed extensively development biology especially important history animals works showed naturalist leanings later empirical works focused biological causation diversity life aristotles successor lyceum theophrastus wrote series books botany survived important contribution antiquity plant sciences even middle ages9
scholars medieval islamic world wrote biology included aljahiz 781–869 aldīnawarī 828–896 wrote botany10 rhazes 865–925 wrote anatomy physiology medicine especially well studied islamic scholars working greek philosopher traditions natural history drew heavily aristotelian thought especially upholding fixed hierarchy life
biology began quickly develop grow anton leeuwenhoeks dramatic improvement microscope scholars discovered spermatozoa bacteria infusoria diversity microscopic life investigations swammerdam interest entomology helped develop basic techniques microscopic dissection staining11
advances microscopy also profound impact biological thinking early 19th century number biologists pointed central importance cell 1838 schleiden schwann began promoting universal ideas basic unit organisms cell individual cells characteristics life although opposed idea cells come division cells thanks work robert remak rudolf virchow however 1860s biologists accepted three tenets came known cell theory1213
meanwhile taxonomy classification became focus natural historians carl linnaeus published basic taxonomy natural world 1735 variations ever since 1750s introduced scientific names species14 georgeslouis leclerc comte buffon treated species artificial categories living forms malleable—even suggesting possibility common descent though opposed evolution buffon figure history evolutionary thought work influenced evolutionary theories lamarck darwin15
serious evolutionary thinking originated works jeanbaptiste lamarck first present coherent theory evolution16 posited evolution result environmental stress properties animals meaning frequently rigorously organ used complex efficient would become thus adapting animal environment lamarck believed acquired traits could passed animals offspring would develop perfect them17 however british naturalist charles darwin combining biogeographical approach humboldt uniformitarian geology lyell malthuss writings population growth morphological expertise extensive natural observations forged successful evolutionary theory based natural selection similar reasoning evidence alfred russel wallace independently reach conclusions1819 although subject controversy continues darwins theory quickly spread scientific community soon became central axiom rapidly developing science biology

found linear chromosomes eukaryotes circular chromosomes prokaryotes chromosome organized structure consisting histones chromosomes cell hereditary information found mitochondria chloroplasts locations collectively known cells genome eukaryotes genomic localized cell nucleus small amounts mitochondria chloroplasts prokaryotes held within irregularly shaped body cytoplasm called nucleoid34 genetic information genome held within genes complete assemblage information organism called genotype35
homeostasis
main article homeostasis




hypothalamus secretes directs pituitary gland secrete acth turn acth directs adrenal cortex secrete glucocorticoids cortisol reduce rate secretion hypothalamus pituitary gland sufficient amount released36


homeostasis ability open system regulate internal environment maintain stable conditions means multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments controlled interrelated regulation mechanisms living organisms whether unicellular multicellular exhibit homeostasis37
maintain dynamic equilibrium effectively carry certain functions system must detect respond perturbations detection perturbation biological system normally responds negative feedback stabilize conditions reducing increasing activity organ system example release glucagon sugar levels

main article systematics
multiple speciation events create tree structured system relationships species role systematics study relationships thus differences similarities species groups species57 however systematics active field research long evolutionary thinking common58
traditionally living things divided five kingdoms monera protista fungi plantae animalia59 however many scientists consider fivekingdom system outdated modern alternative classification systems generally begin threedomain system archaea originally archaebacteria bacteria originally eubacteria eukaryota including protists fungi plants animals60 domains reflect whether cells nuclei well differences chemical composition biomolecules ribosomes60
kingdom broken recursively species separately classified order domain kingdom phylum class order family genus species
outside categories obligate intracellular parasites edge life61 terms metabolic activity meaning many scientists actually classify structures alive lack least fundamental functions characteristics define life classified viruses viroids prions satellites
