note word jāmiʻah arabic جامعة‎ simply means university information islamic university disambiguation

scholars like arnold green seyyed hossein nasr argued starting 10th century medieval islamic madaris indeed became universities3132 however scholars like george makdisi toby huff norman daniel3334 argue european medieval university parallel medieval islamic world35 darleen pryds questions view pointing madaris european universities mediterranean region shared similar foundations princely patrons intended provide loyal administrators rulers agenda36 number scholars regard university uniquely european origin characteristics3738394041 according encyclopædia britannica however earliest universities founded asia africa predating first european medieval universities4243

however classification madaris universities disputed question understanding institution terms madaris ijāzahs issued field islamic religious sharīʻah field learning52 academic subjects including natural sciences philosophy literary studies treated ancillary study sharia53 example natural science like astronomy studied supply religious needs like time prayer54 ptolemaic astronomy considered adequate still taught modern madaris54 islamic undergraduate degree alazhar prestigious madrasa traditionally granted without final examinations basis students attentive attendance courses55 contrast medieval doctorate granted collective authority faculty islamic degree granted teacher pupil based formal criteria remained personal matter sole prerogative person bestowing could force give one56
medievalist specialists define university legally autonomous corporation disagree term university islamic madaris jāmi‘ahs medieval university latin universitas structurally different legally autonomous corporation rather waqf institution like madrasa jāmiʻah57 despite many similarities medieval specialists coined term islamic college madrasa jāmiʻah differentiate legally autonomous corporations medieval european universities sense madrasa resembles university college features university lacks corporate element toby huff summarises difference follows

structural legal point view madrasa university contrasting types whereas madrasa pious endowment religious charitable foundations waqf universities europe legally autonomous corporate entities many legal rights privileges included capacity make internal rules regulations right sell property legal representation various forums make contracts sued58

muslim institutions higher learning madrasa legal designation waqf central eastern islamic lands view madrasa charitable endowment remain control donor descendent resulted spurt establishment madaris 11th 12th centuries however western islamic lands maliki views prohibited donors controlling endowment madaris popular unlike corporate designation western institutions higher learning waqf designation seemed exclusion nonorthodox religious subjects philosophy natural science curricula59 madrasa alqarawīyīn surviving madaris predate founding earliest medieval universities thus claimed first universities authors acquired official university status late 194760 alazhar acquire status name essence course numerous reforms 19th 20th century notably 1961 introduced nonreligious subjects curriculum economics engineering medicine agriculture61 also noted many medieval universities centuries christian cathedral schools monastic schools prior formal establishment universitas scholarium evidence immediate forerunners university dates back century ad62 thus well preceding earliest madaris george makdisi published extensively topic63 concludes comparison institutions

thus university form social organization peculiar medieval europe later exported parts world including muslim east remained present back middle ages outside europe nothing anything quite like anywhere64

nevertheless makdisi asserted european university borrowed many features islamic madrasa including concepts degree doctorate24 makdisi hugh goddard also highlighted terms concepts used modern universities likely islamic origins including fact still talk professors holding chairman subject based traditional islamic pattern teaching professor sits chair students around term academic circles derived islamic students circle around professor terms fellows reading subject obtaining degrees traced back islamic concepts aṣḥāb companions muhammad qirāʼah reading aloud quran ijāzah licence teach respectively makdisi listed eighteen parallels terminology traced back roots islamic education practices common modern universities makdisi goddard trace back islamic root include practices delivering inaugural lectures wearing academic robes obtaining doctorates defending thesis even idea academic freedom also modelled islamic custom65 islamic scholarly system fatwá ijmāʻ meaning opinion consensus respectively formed basis scholarly system west practised university scholarship middle ages present day66 according makdisi goddard idea academic freedom universities also modelled islamic custom practised medieval madrasa system century islamic influence certainly discernible foundation first deliberately planned university europe university naples federico founded frederick holy roman emperor 122465
however facets medieval university life considered standard scholarship independent medieval european developments tracable islamic influence67 generally reviewers pointed strong inclination makdisi overstating case simply resting accumulation close parallels failing point convincing channels transmission muslim christian world68 norman daniel points arab equivalent latin disputation taliqa reserved rulers court madrasa actual differences islamic fiqh medieval european civil profound68 taliqa reached islamic spain likely point transmission establishment first medieval universities68 fact latin translation taliqa importantly evidence latin scholars ever showing awareness arab influence latin method disputation something would certainly found noteworthy68 rather medieval reception greek organon scholastic motion69 daniel concludes resemblances method religions common problems reconcile conflicting statements authorities safeguard data revelation impact greek philosophy thus christian scholasticism similar arab concepts viewed terms parallel occurrence transmission ideas other69 view shared hugh kennedy70
toby huff discussion makdisis hypothesis argues

remains case equivalent bachelors degree licentia docendi higher degrees ever emerged medieval early modern islamic madrasas71

george saliba criticized huffs views regarding legal autonomy european universities limited curriculum madrasahs demonstrating many madrasahs dedicated teaching nonreligious subjects arguing madrasahs generally greater legal autonomy medieval european universities according saliba madrasahs fully protected interference curriculum endowments established first place examples include dakhwariyya madrasah damascus dedicated medicine subject also taught islamic hospitals madrasah established kamal aldin mana 1242 mosul taught astronomy music testaments ulugh beg’s madrasah samarqand taught astronomy shii madrasahs iran taught astronomy along religious studies according saliba72

noted original article students medieval islamic world full freedom chose teacher subjects would study together could worse today’s students required pursue specific curriculum usually designed promote ideas elders preserve tradition rather introduce innovative ideas challenge ‘received texts’ moreover professor huff looked carefully european institutions produced science would found mainly academies royal courts protected individual potentates universities wishes promote neither universities courts beyond reach inquisition another point seems neglect
