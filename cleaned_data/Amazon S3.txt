competing servicesedit
broad adoption amazon related tooling given rise competing services based services standard programming interface however differentiated underlying technologies supporting business models56 cloud storage standard like electrical networking standards enables competing service providers design services clients using different parts different ways still communicate provide following benefits57

increase competition providing rules level playing field encouraging market entry smaller companies might otherwise precluded
encourage innovation cloud storage tool vendors developers focus improving products services instead focusing compatibility
allow economies scale implementation service provider encounters outage clients outgrow tools need faster operating systems tools easily swap solutions
provide timely solutions delivering functionality response demands marketplace business growth locations increases demand clients easily change service providers simply subscribing service

examples competing compliant storage implementations include

pure storages flashblade
