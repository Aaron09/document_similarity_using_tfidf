weather forecasting application science technology predict conditions atmosphere given location time human beings attempted predict weather informally millennia formally since 19th century weather forecasts made collecting quantitative data current state atmosphere given place using meteorology project atmosphere change
humanonly endeavor based mainly upon changes barometric pressure current weather conditions condition weather forecasting relies computerbased models take many atmospheric factors account1 human input still required pick best possible forecast model base forecast upon involves pattern recognition skills teleconnections knowledge model performance knowledge model biases inaccuracy forecasting chaotic nature atmosphere massive computational power required solve equations describe atmosphere error involved measuring initial conditions incomplete understanding atmospheric processes hence forecasts become less accurate difference current time time forecast made range forecast increases ensembles model consensus help narrow error pick likely outcome

historyedit
ancient forecastingedit
millennia people tried forecast weather babylonians predicted weather cloud patterns well astrology aristotle described weather patterns meteorologica3 later theophrastus compiled book weather forecasting called book signs4 chinese weather prediction lore extends least back also around time ancient indian astronomers developed weatherprediction methods6 testament times christ referred deciphering understanding local weather patterns saying evening comes fair weather morning today stormy overcast know interpret appearance cannot interpret signs times7
wahshiyyas nabatean agriculture discussed weather forecasting atmospheric changes signs planetary astral alterations signs rain based observation lunar phases weather forecasts based movement winds8
ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied observed patterns events also termed pattern recognition example might observed sunset particularly following often brought fair weather experience accumulated generations produce weather lore however allwhich predictions prove reliable many since found stand rigorous statistical testing9

royal charter sank 1859 storm stimulating establishment modern weather forecasting


invention electric telegraph 1835 modern weather forecasting began10 fastest distant weather reports could travel around miles typically 40–75 miles 60–120 kmday whether land sea1112 late 1840s telegraph allowed reports weather conditions wide area received almost instantaneously13 allowing forecasts made knowledge weather conditions upwind
credited birth forecasting science officer royal navy francis beaufort protégé robert fitzroy influential british naval governmental circles though ridiculed press time work gained scientific credence accepted royal navy formed basis todays weather forecasting knowledge1415
beaufort developed wind force scale weather notation coding journals remainder life also promoted development reliable tide tables around british shores friend william whewell expanded weather recordkeeping british coast guard stations
robert fitzroy appointed 1854 chief department within board trade deal collection weather data service mariners forerunner modern meteorological office15 ship captains tasked collating data weather computing tested instruments loaned purpose16
