military planning
preliminary planning attack pearl harbor protect move southern resource area japanese term dutch east indies southeast asia generally begun early 1941 auspices admiral isoroku yamamoto commanding japans combined fleet40 assent formal planning training attack imperial japanese navy general staff much contention naval headquarters including threat resign command41 fullscale planning underway early spring 1941 primarily rear admiral ryūnosuke kusaka assistance captain minoru genda yamamotos deputy chief staff captain kameto kuroshima42 planners studied 1940 british attack italian fleet taranto intensivelynb
next several months pilots trained equipment adapted intelligence collected despite preparations emperor hirohito approve attack plan november third four imperial conferences called consider matter45 final authorization given emperor december majority japanese leaders advised hull note would destroy fruits china incident endanger manchukuo undermine japanese control korea46
late 1941 many observers believed hostilities japan imminent gallup poll attack pearl harbor found americans expected japan opinion47 pacific bases facilities placed alert many occasions officials doubted pearl harbor would first target instead expected philippines would attacked first presumption threat bases throughout country naval base manila posed lanes well shipment supplies japan territory south48 also incorrectly believed japan capable mounting major naval operation time49
objectives
japanese attack several major aims first intended destroy important american fleet units thereby preventing pacific fleet interfering japanese conquest dutch east indies malaya enable japan conquer southeast asia without interference second hoped time japan consolidate position increase naval strength shipbuilding authorized 1940 vinsonwalsh erased chance victory5051 third deliver blow americas ability mobilize forces pacific battleships chosen main targets since prestige ships navy time50 finally hoped attack would undermine american morale government would drop demands contrary japanese interests would seek compromise peace japan5253
striking pacific fleet anchor pearl harbor carried distinct disadvantages targeted ships would shallow water would relatively easy salvage possibly repair crews would survive attack since many would shore leave would rescued harbor important disadvantage—this timing known japanese—was absence pearl harbor three pacific fleets aircraft carriers enterprise lexington saratoga command imbued admiral mahans decisive battle doctrine—especially destroying maximum number battleships—that despite concerns yamamoto decided press ahead54page needed
japanese confidence ability achieve short victorious also meant targets harbor especially navy yard tank farms submarine base ignored since—by thinking—the would influence facilities would felt55

decades conventional wisdom held japan attacked without first formally breaking diplomatic relations accidents bumbling delayed delivery document hinting washington 1999 however takeo iguchi professor international relations international christian university tokyo discovered documents pointed vigorous debate inside government indeed whether notify washington japans intention break negotiations start including december entry diary saying deceptive diplomacy steadily proceeding toward success iguchi said diary shows army navy want give proper declaration indeed prior notice even termination negotiations clearly prevailed7677

american antiaircraft performance improved considerably second strike thirds japans losses incurred second wave105
nagumo felt launched third strike would risking three quarters combined fleets strength wipe remaining targets included facilities suffering higher aircraft losses105
location american carriers remained unknown addition admiral concerned force within range american landbased bombers105 nagumo uncertain whether enough surviving planes remaining hawaii launch attack carriers106
third wave would required substantial preparation turnaround time would meant returning planes would land night time royal navy developed night carrier techniques substantial risk107
task forces fuel situation permit remain waters north pearl harbor much longer since limit logistical support risked running unacceptably fuel perhaps even abandon destroyers route home108
believed second strike essentially satisfied main objective mission—the neutralization pacific fleet—and wish risk losses109 moreover japanese navy practice prefer conservation strength total destruction enemy110
