data information knowledge wisdom closely related concepts role relation term meaning according common view data collected analyzed data becomes information suitable making decisions analyzed fashion knowledge derived extensive amounts experience dealing information subject example height mount everest generally considered data height recorded precisely altimeter entered database data included book along data mount everest describe mountain manner useful wish make decision best method climb using understanding based experience climbing mountains advise persons reach mount everests peak seen knowledge complement series data information knowledge wisdom would mean status person possession certain knowledge also knows circumstances good
data often assumed least abstract concept information next least knowledge abstract7 view data becomes information interpretation height mount everest generally considered data book mount everest geological characteristics considered information climbers guidebook containing practical information best reach mount everests peak considered knowledge information bears diversity meanings ranges everyday usage technical view however also argued provide upsidedown model relation data information knowledge8 generally speaking concept information closely related notions constraint communication control data form instruction knowledge meaning mental stimulus pattern perception representation beynondavies uses concept sign differentiate data information data series symbols information occurs symbols used refer something910
development computing devices machines people could collect data impose patterns since development computing devices machines devices also collect data 2010s computers widely used many fields collect data sort process disciplines ranging marketing analysis social services usage citizens scientific research patterns data seen information used enhance knowledge patterns interpreted truth though truth subjective concept authorized aesthetic ethical criteria disciplines cultures events leave behind perceivable physical virtual remains traced back data marks longer considered data link mark observation broken11

data collection
gathering data accomplished primary source researcher first person obtain data secondary source researcher obtains data already collected sources data disseminated scientific journal data analysis methodologies vary include data triangulation data percolation latter offers articulate method collecting classifying analyzing data using five possible angles analysis least three order maximize researchs objectivity permit understanding phenomena investigation complete possible qualitative quantitative methods literature reviews including scholarly articles interviews experts computer simulation data thereafter percolated using series predetermined steps extract relevant information
fieldsedit
though data also increasingly used fields suggested highly interpretive nature might odds ethos data given peter checkland introduced term capta latin capere take” distinguish immense number possible data subset attention oriented13 johanna drucker argued since humanities affirm knowledge production situated partial constitutive using data introduce assumptions counterproductive example phenomena discrete observerindependent14 term capta emphasizes observation constitutive offered alternative data visual representations humanities
