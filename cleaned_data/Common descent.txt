historyedit
also history evolutionary thought
1740s french mathematician pierre louis maupertuis made first known suggestion organisms common ancestor diverged random variation natural selection1011 essai cosmologie 1750 maupertuis noted

fortuitous combination productions nature since creatures could survive whose organizations certain degree adaptation present nothing extraordinary fact adaptation actually found species exist chance might turned vast number individuals small proportion organized manner animals organs could satisfy needs much greater number showed neither adaptation order last perished thus species today small part blind destiny produced12

1790 philosopher immanuel kant wrote kritik urteilskraft critique judgement similaritya animal forms implies common original type thus common parent13
1794 charles darwins grandfather erasmus darwin asked

would bold imagine great length time since earth began exist perhaps millions ages commencement history mankind would bold imagine warmblooded animals arisen living filament great first cause endued animality power acquiring parts attended propensities directed irritations sensations volitions associations thus possessing faculty continuing improve inherent activity delivering improvements generation posterity world without end14

charles darwins views common descent expressed origin species probable progenitor life forms

therefore infer analogy probably organic beings ever lived earth descended primordial form life first breathed15

genetic code translation table according information translated amino acids hence proteins nearly identical known lifeforms bacteria archaea animals plants universality code generally regarded biologists definitive evidence favor universal common descent16
codons triplets mapped amino acids seems strongly optimised richard egel argues particular hydrophobic nonpolar sidechains well organised suggesting enabled earliest organisms create peptides waterrepelling regions able support essential electron exchange redox reactions energy transfer18
selectively neutral similaritiesedit
similarities adaptive relevance cannot explained convergent evolution therefore provide compelling support universal common descent evidence come areas amino acid sequences sequences proteins threedimensional structure need identical amino acid sequences irrelevant similarity sequences evidence common descent certain cases several codons triplets code redundantly amino acid since many species codon place specify amino acid represented codon evidence sharing recent common ancestor amino acid sequences come different ancestors would coded redundant codons since correct amino acids would already place natural selection would driven change codons however much time available genetic drift could change codons would extremely unlikely make redundant codons whole sequence match exactly across multiple lineages similarly shared nucleotide sequences especially apparently neutral positioning introns pseudogenes provide strong evidence common ancestry19
similaritiesedit
universality many aspects cellular life often pointed supportive evidence compelling evidence listed similarities include energy carrier adenosine triphosphate fact amino acids found proteins lefthanded however possible similarities resulted laws physics chemistry rather universal common descent therefore resulted convergent evolution contrast evidence homology central subunits transmembrane atpases throughout living organisms especially rotating elements bound membrane supports assumption luca cellular organism although primordial membranes semipermeable evolved later membranes modern bacteria second path modern archaea also20
phylogenetic treesedit




































phylogenetic tree based ribosomal genes implies single origin life


main article phylogenetic tree
also tree life biology
another important piece evidence detailed phylogenetic trees genealogic trees species mapping proposed divisions common ancestors living species 2010 douglas theobald published statistical analysis available genetic data1 mapping phylogenetic trees gave strong quantitative support formal test unity life2
traditionally trees built using morphological methods appearance embryology recently possible construct trees using molecular data based similarities differences genetic protein sequences methods produce essentially similar results even though genetic variation influence external morphology phylogenetic trees based different types information agree strong evidence real underlying common descent21
potential objectionsedit




2005 tree life shows many horizontal gene transfers implying multiple possible origins


gene exchange clouds phylogenetic analysisedit
information horizontal gene transfer
theobald noted substantial horizontal gene transfer could occurred early evolution bacteria today remain capable gene exchange distantlyrelated lineages weakens basic assumption phylogenetic analysis similarity genomes implies common ancestry sufficient gene exchange would allow lineages share much genome whether shared ancestor monophyly questions single ancestry life1 however biologists consider unlikely completely unrelated protoorganisms could exchanged genes different coding mechanisms would resulted garble rather functioning systems later however many organisms derived single ancestor could readily shared genes worked appears have1
convergent evolutionedit
information convergent evolution
early organisms driven environmental conditions evolve similar biochemistry convergently might independently acquired similar genetic sequences theobalds formal test accordingly criticised takahiro yonezawa colleagues22 including consideration convergence argued theobalds test insufficient distinguish competing hypotheses theobald defended method claim arguing tests distinguish phylogenetic structure mere sequence similarity therefore theobald argued results show real universally conserved proteins homologous2324
