modeledit
contains rich primitives used build application specific schemas application languages primitives include

feature
geometry
coordinate reference system
topology
time
dynamic feature
coverage including geographic images
unit measure
directions
observations
presentation styling rules

original model based world wide consortiums resource description framework subsequently introduced schemas gmls structure help connect various existing geographic databases whose relational structure schemas easily define resulting xmlschemabased retains many features including idea child elements properties parent object rdfs remote property references
profileedit
profiles logical restrictions expressed document schema profiles intended simplify adoption facilitate rapid adoption standard following profiles defined specification published proposed public

point profile applications point geometric data without need full grammar
simple features profile supporting vector feature requests transactions
profile gmljp2 jpeg 2000
profile

note profiles distinct application schemas profiles part namespaces open define restricted subsets application schemas vocabularies defined using live applicationdefined target namespace application schemas built specific profiles full schema
profiles often created support derived languages application schemas created support particular application domains commercial aviation nautical charting resource exploitation
specification since contains pair xslt scripts usually referred subset tool used construct profiles
simple features profileedit
simple features profile complete profile point profile supports wide range vector feature objects including following

reduced geometry model allowing linear geometric objects based linear interpolation corresponding aggregate geometries gmlmultipoint gmlmulticurve
simplified feature model level deep general model arbitrary nesting features feature properties permitted
nongeometric properties must schema simple types cannot contain nested elements
remote property value references xlinkhref like main specification

since profile aims provide simple entry point provide support following

coverages
topology
observations
value objects real time sensor data
dynamic features

nonetheless supports good variety real world problems
subset tooledit
addition specification provides subset tool generate profiles containing userspecified list components tool consists three xslt scripts scripts generate profile developer extend manually otherwise enhance schema restriction note restrictions full specification application schemas profile generate must valid application schemas
subset tool generate profiles many reasons well listing elements attributes include resultant profile schema running tool results single profile schema file containing userspecified items element attribute type declarations specified items depend profile schemas created manner support specifications including jpeg 2000
application schemaedit
order expose applications geographic data community organization creates schema specific application domain interest application schema schema describes object types whose data community interested community applications must expose example application tourism define object types including monuments places interest museums road exits viewpoints application schema object types turn reference primitive object types defined standard
list known publicly available application schemas assembled
markup languages geography schema constructs builds existing schema model instead creating schema language

geometriesedit
encodes geometries geometric characteristics geographic objects elements within documents according vector model geometries objects describe example roads rivers bridges
geometry object types following

point
linestring
polygon

higher also includes structures describe coverage information raster model gathered remote sensors images including satellite data
featuresedit
defines features distinct geometry objects feature application object represents physical entity building river person feature geometric aspects geometry object defines location region instead physical entity hence different feature
feature various geometry properties describe geometric aspects characteristics feature features point extent properties also provides ability features share geometry property another using remote property reference shared geometry property remote properties general feature borrowed xlinkhref attribute geometry property means value property resource referenced link
example building feature particular application schema might position given primitive geometry object type point however building separate entity point defines position addition feature several geometry properties none example extent position
coordinatesedit
coordinates represent coordinates geometry objects coordinates specified following elements

gmlcoordinates
gmlpos
gmlposlist

multiple ways represent coordinates example gmlcoordinates element used follows


gmlpoint gmlidp21 srsnamehttpwwwopengisnetdefcrsepsg04326
gmlcoordinates4567 8856gmlcoordinates
gmlpoint

note expressed individual coordinates 8856 separately accessible document object model since content gmlcoordinates element single string
make coordinates accessible introduced gmlpos gmlposlist elements note although versions gmlcoord element treated defect used using gmlpos element instead gmlcoordinates element point represented follows


gmlpoint gmlidp21 srsnamehttpwwwopengisnetdefcrsepsg04326
gmlpos srsdimension24567 8856gmlpos
gmlpoint

coordinates gmllinestring geometry object represented gmlcoordinates element


gmllinestring gmlidp21 srsnamehttpwwwopengisnetdefcrsepsg04326
gmlcoordinates4567 8856 55568944gmlcoordinates
gmllinestring

gmlposlist element used represent list coordinate tuples required linear geometries


gmllinestring gmlidp21 srsnamehttpwwwopengisnetdefcrsepsg04326
gmlposlist srsdimension24567 8856 5556 8944gmlposlist
gmllinestring

data servers conversion tools support gmlcoordinates element alternative gmlcoordinates documents later however gmlpos gmlposlist preferable gmlcoordinates
information srsname attribute coordinate reference system
coordinate reference systemedit
main article coordinate reference system
coordinate reference system determines geometry geometry element document
unlike georss default coordinate system none provided instead desired coordinate system must specified explicitly elements whose coordinates interpreted respect include following

gmlcoordinates
gmlpos
gmlposlist

srsname attribute attached geometry object specifies objects shown following example


gmlpoint gmlidp1 srsnamesrs36
gmlcoordinates100200gmlcoordinates
gmlpoint

value srsname attribute uniform resource identifier refers definition used interpret coordinates geometry definition document flat file online service values epsg codes resolved using registry service operated producers association httpwwwepsgregistryorg
srsname also uniform resource name referencing common definition developed structure specific urns encode common resolver resolves urns definitions
examplesedit

gxml japanedit
events unfolding work continuing parallel japan gxml auspices japanese database promotion center direction shige kawano gxml differed several important respects targeted applications gxml employed many concrete geographic objects mover provided limited concrete built complex objects application schemas point time gxml still written using already transitioned schema hand gxml required many fundamental constructs time lexicon including temporality spatial references identifiers objects histories concept topologybased styling hand offered limited primitives geometry feature recipe construct user defined object feature types
meetings held tokyo january 2001 involving lake galdos richard martell galdos staff kurt buehler david schell shige kawano akifumi nakai data shimada hitachi signing would endeavour inject fundamental elements required support gxml thus enabling gxml written application schema resulted many types entering gml’s core object list including observations dynamic features temporal objects default styles topology viewpoints much work conducted galdos contract data laid foundation although significant development occurred time frame namely intersection isotc
