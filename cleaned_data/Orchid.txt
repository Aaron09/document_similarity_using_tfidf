high resolution image orchid


orchids easily distinguished plants share evident shared derived characteristics apomorphies among bilateral symmetry flower zygomorphism many resupinate flowers nearly always highly modified petal labellum fused stamens carpels extremely small seeds
stem rootsedit




germinating seeds temperate orchid anacamptis coriophora protocorm first organ develop true roots leaves


orchids perennial herbs lack permanent woody structure grow according patterns

monopodial stem grows single leaves added apex year stem grows longer accordingly stem orchids monopodial growth reach several metres length vanda vanilla
sympodial sympodial orchids front newest growth back oldest growth5 plant produces series adjacent shoots grow certain size bloom stop growing replaced sympodial orchids grow laterally rather vertically following surface support growth continues development leads leaves roots sprouting next previous year cattleya lead developing rhizome start growth socalled undeveloped thereby branching sympodial orchids visible pseudobulbs joined rhizome creeps along beneath soil





anacamptis lactea showing tubers


terrestrial orchids rhizomatous form corms tubers root caps terrestrial orchids smooth white
sympodial terrestrial orchids orchis ophrys subterranean tuberous roots used food reserve wintry periods provides development visible growth develops
warm constantly humid climates many terrestrial orchids need pseudobulbs
epiphytic orchids grow upon support modified aerial roots sometimes meters long older parts roots modified spongy epidermis called velamen function absorb humidity made dead cells silverygrey white brown appearance orchids velamen includes spongy fibrous bodies near passage cells called tilosomes
cells root epidermis grow right angle axis root allow firm grasp support nutrients epiphytic orchids mainly come mineral dust organic detritus animal droppings substances collecting among supporting surfaces




pseudobulb prosthechea fragrans


base stem sympodial epiphytes species essentially entire stem thickened form pseudobulb contains nutrients water drier periods
pseudobulb smooth surface lengthwise grooves different shapes often conical oblong size variable small species bulbophyllum longer millimeters largest orchid world grammatophyllum speciosum giant orchid reach three meters dendrobium species long canelike pseudobulbs short rounded leaves whole length orchids hidden extremely small pseudobulbs completely included inside leaves
ageing pseudobulb sheds leaves becomes dormant stage often called backbulb backbulbs still hold nutrition plant pseudobulb usually takes exploiting last reserves accumulated backbulb eventually dies pseudobulb typically lives five years orchids without noticeable pseudobulbs also said growths individual component sympodial plant
leavesedit
like monocots orchids generally simple leaves parallel veins although vanilloideae reticulate venation leaves ovate lanceolate orbiculate variable size individual plant characteristics often diagnostic normally alternate stem often folded lengthwise along centre plicate stipules orchid leaves often siliceous bodies called stegmata vascular bundle sheaths present orchidoideae fibrous
structure leaves corresponds specific habitat plant species typically bask sunlight grow sites occasionally thick leathery leaves laminae covered waxy cuticle retain necessary water supply shadeloving species hand long thin leaves
leaves orchids perennial live several years others especially plicate leaves catasetum shed annually develop leaves together pseudobulbs
leaves orchids considered ornamental leaves macodes sanderiana semiterrestrial rockhugging lithophyte orchid show sparkling silver gold veining light green background cordate leaves psychopsis limminghei light brownishgreen maroonpuce markings created flower pigments attractive mottle leaves ladys slippers tropical subtropical asia paphiopedilum caused uneven distribution chlorophyll also phalaenopsis schilleriana pastel pink orchid leaves spotted dark green light green jewel orchid ludisia discolor grown colorful leaves white flowers
orchids dendrophylax lindenii ghost orchid aphyllorchis taeniophyllum depend green roots photosynthesis lack normally developed leaves heterotrophic species
orchids genus corallorhiza coralroot orchids lack leaves altogether instead wrap roots around roots mature trees specialized fungi harvest sugars6




vanda cultivar


flowersedit
orchidaceae well known many structural variations flowers
orchids single flowers racemose inflorescence sometimes large number flowers flowering stem basal produced base tuber like cymbidium apical meaning grows apex main stem like cattleya axillary leaf axil vanda
apomorphy clade orchid flowers primitively zygomorphic bilaterally symmetrical although genera like mormodes ludisia macodes kind symmetry difficult notice




dactylorhiza sambucina orchidoideae reference


orchid flower like flowers monocots whorls sterile elements outer whorl three sepals inner whorl three petals sepals usually similar petals thus called tepals completely distinct
medial petal called labellum always modified enlarged actually upper medial petal however flower develops inferior ovary pedicel usually rotates 180° labellum arrives lower part flower thus becoming suitable form platform pollinators characteristic called resupination occurs primitively family considered apomorphic derived characteristic orchidaceae share torsion ovary evident longitudinal section shown right orchids secondarily lost resupination epidendrum secundum




longitudinal section flower vanilla planifolia


normal form sepals found cattleya form triangle paphiopedilum venus slippers lower sepals fused synsepal taken form slipper masdevallia sepals fused
orchid flowers abnormal numbers petals lips called peloric peloria genetic trait expression environmentally influenced appear random




laeliocattleya cultivar shows normal form petals


orchid flowers primitively three stamens situation limited genus neuwiedia apostasia cypripedioideae stamens central sterile reduced staminode orchids clade called monandria retain central stamen others reduced staminodes filaments stamens always adnate fused style form cylindrical structure called gynostemium column primitive apostasioideae fusion partial vanilloideae deep orchidoideae epidendroideae total stigma asymmetrical lobes bent towards centre flower bottom column
pollen released single grains like plants apostasioideae cypripedioideae vanilloideae subfamilies comprise great majority orchids anther carries pollinia
pollinium waxy mass pollen grains held together gluelike alkaloid viscin containing cellulosic strands mucopolysaccharides pollinium connected filament take form caudicle dactylorhiza habenaria stipe vanda caudicles stipes hold pollinia viscidium sticky sticks pollinia body pollinators
upper edge stigma singleanthered orchids front anther rostellum slender extension involved complex pollination mechanism
mentioned ovary always inferior located behind flower threecarpelate rarely threepartitioned parietal placentation axile apostasioideae
2011 bulbophyllum nocturnum discovered flower nocturnally7
pollinationedit
complex mechanisms orchids evolved achieve crosspollination investigated charles darwin described fertilisation orchids 1862 orchids developed highly specialized pollination systems thus chances pollinated often scarce orchid flowers usually remain receptive long periods rendering unpollinated flowers longlasting cultivation orchids deliver pollen single mass time pollination succeeds thousands ovules fertilized
pollinators often visually attracted shape colours labellum however bulbophyllum species attract male fruit flies bactrocera solely floral chemical simultaneously acts floral reward methyl eugenol raspberry ketone zingerone perform pollination8 flowers produce attractive odours although absent species nectar produced spur labellum illustration point sepals septa ovary typical position amongst asparagales
orchids produce pollinia pollination happens variant following sequence pollinator enters flower touches viscidium promptly sticks body generally head abdomen leaving flower pulls pollinium anther connected viscidium caudicle stipe caudicle bends pollinium moved forwards downwards pollinator enters another flower species pollinium taken position stick stigma second flower rostellum pollinating possessors orchids able reproduce process pencil small paintbrush similar device




ophrys apifera selfpollinate


orchids mainly totally rely selfpollination especially colder regions pollinators particularly rare caudicles flower visited pollinator pollinia fall directly stigma otherwise anther rotate enter stigma cavity flower holcoglossum amesianum
slipper orchid paphiopedilum parishii reproduces selffertilization occurs anther changes solid liquid state directly contacts stigma surface without pollinating agent floral assembly9
labellum cypripedioideae poke bonnetshaped function trapping visiting insects exit leads anthers deposit pollen visitor
extremely specialized orchids eurasian genus ophrys labellum adapted colour shape odour attracts male insects mimicry receptive female pollination happens insect attempts mate flowers
many neotropical orchids pollinated male orchid bees visit flowers gather volatile chemicals require synthesize pheromonal attractants males species euglossa imperialis eulaema meriana observed leave territories periodically forage aromatic compounds cineole synthesize pheromone attracting mating females1011 type orchid places pollinia different body part different species enforce proper crosspollination
rare achlorophyllous saprophytic orchid growing entirely underground australia rhizanthella slateri never exposed light depends ants terrestrial insects pollinate
catasetum genus discussed briefly darwin actually launches viscid pollinia explosive force insect touches seta knocking pollinator flower
pollination sepals petals fade wilt usually remain attached ovary
asexual reproductionedit
species phalaenopsis dendrobium vanda produce offshoots plantlets formed nodes along stem accumulation growth hormones point shoots known keiki
fruits seedsedit




crosssections orchid capsules showing longitudinal slits


ovary typically develops capsule dehiscent three longitudinal slits remaining closed ends
seeds generally almost microscopic numerous species million capsule ripening blow like dust particles spores lack endosperm must enter symbiotic relationships various mycorrhizal basidiomyceteous fungi provide necessary nutrients germinate orchid species mycoheterotrophic germination reliant upon fungi complete lifecycles




closeup phalaenopsis blossom


chance seed meet suitable fungus small minute fraction seeds released grow adult plants cultivation germination typically takes weeks
horticultural techniques devised germinating orchid seeds artificial nutrient medium eliminating requirement fungus germination greatly aiding propagation ornamental orchids usual medium sowing orchids artificial conditions agar agar combined carbohydrate energy source carbohydrate source combinations discrete sugars derived sources banana pineapple peach even tomato puree coconut water preparation agar agar medium poured test tubes jars autoclaved cooked pressure cooker sterilize medium cooking medium begins cools
