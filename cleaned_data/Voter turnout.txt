voter turnout varies considerably nations tends lower united states asia latin america europe canadacitation needed oceania western europe averages turnout south central america around since 194556 differences nations tend greater classes ethnic groups regions within nations confusingly factors cause internal differences seem apply global level instance nations bettereducated populaces higher turnouts main commonly cited causes international differences culture institutions however much debate relative impact various factors
cultural factorsedit
wealth literacy effect turnout reliable measures countries angola ethiopia long high turnouts wealthy states europe united nations human development index shows correlation higher standards living higher turnout democracy also important factor elections require considerable involvement population takes time develop cultural habit voting associated understanding confidence electoral process factor explain lower turnouts newer democracies eastern europe latin america much impetus vote comes sense civic duty takes time certain social conditions take decades develop

trust government

demographics also effect older people tend vote youths societies average somewhat higher europe higher turnouts somewhat younger countries united states populations mobile lower marriage rates tend lower turnout countries highly multicultural multilingual difficult national election campaigns engage sectors population
nature elections also varies nations united states negative campaigning character attacks common elsewhere potentially suppressing turnouts focus placed vote efforts massmarketing important effects turnout partisanship important impetus turnout highly partisan likely vote turnout tends higher nations political allegiance closely linked class ethnic linguistic religious loyalties58 countries multiparty systems developed also tend higher turnouts nations party specifically geared towards working class tend higher turnouts among class countries voters tent parties appeal voters choose from59 fourwave panel study conducted 2010 swedish national election campaign show clear differences media groups political social media attention political news traditional media increase political engagement time60
institutional factorsedit
institutional factors significant impact voter turnout rules laws also generally easier change attitudes much work done improve voter turnout looks factors making voting compulsory direct dramatic effect turnout simply making easier candidates stand easier nomination rules believed increase voting conversely adding barriers separate registration process suppress turnout salience election effect vote policy proportionality closely result reflects people structural factors also likely important effects turnout
voter registrationedit
modalities electoral registration conducted also affect turnout example rolling registration introduced united kingdom possibility electoral register updated currency even amending genuine mistakes certain date register compiled october would come force next february would remain valid next january electoral register would become progressively date period validity electors moved died also people studying working away home often difficulty voting meant elections taking place later year tended lower turnouts earlier year introduction rolling registration register updated monthly reduced entirely eliminated issue since process amending register automatic individuals join electoral register annual october compilation process
another country highly efficient registration process france eighteen youth automatically registered residents citizens moved responsible bearing costs inconvenience updating registration similarly nordic countries citizens residents included official population register simultaneously list voter registration membership universal health system residents required report change address register within short time moving also system germany without membership health system
elimination registration separate bureaucratic step result higher voter turnout reflected statistics united states bureau census 1982–1983 states registration registration requirements higher voter turnout national average time report four states allowed election registration minnesota wisconsin maine oregon since idaho maine changed allow registration north dakota state requires registration61
compulsory votingedit
strongest factors affecting voter turnout whether voting compulsory australia voter registration attendance polling booth mandatory since 1920s recent federal election 2013 turnout figures 9323 house representatives 9388 senate6263 several countries similar laws generally somewhat reduced levels enforcement bolivian voter fails participate election citizen denied withdrawal salary bank three months64
mexico brazil existing sanctions nonvoting minimal rarely enforced enforced compulsion dramatic effect turnout
venezuela netherlands compulsory voting rescinded resulting substantial decreases turnout
greece voting compulsory however practically sanctions vote
belgium luxembourg voting compulsory strongly enforced luxembourg voters physically handicapped chronically legal obligation vote
sanctions nonvoting behaviour foreseen sometimes even absence formal requirement vote italy constitution describes voting duty though electoral participation obligatory 1946 1992 thus italian electoral included light sanctions nonvoters lists nonvoters posted polling stations65 turnout rates declined substantially since 1992 italy though pointing factors compulsory voting explain high electoral participation
salienceedit
mark franklin argues salience perceived effect individual vote country significant effect turnout presents switzerland example nation salience nations administration highly decentralized federal government limited powers government invariably consists coalition parties power wielded party closely linked position relative coalition number votes received important decisions placed population referendum individual votes federal legislature thus unlikely significant effect nation probably explains average turnouts country contrast malta worlds highest voter turnouts single legislature holds near monopoly political power malta twoparty system small swing votes completely alter executive66 hand countries party system experience turnout large numbers potential voters perceive little real difference main parties voters perceptions fairness also important effect salience voters feel result election likely determined fraud corruption people fewer people vote67
proportionalityedit
another institutional factor important effect proportionality closely legislature reflects views populace pure proportional representation system composition legislature fully proportional votes populace voter sure represented parliament even opposition benches however many nations utilise form proportional representation elections depart pure proportionality stipulating smaller parties supported certain threshold percentage votes cast excluded parliament contrast voting system based single seat constituencies plurality system used north american india tend result many noncompetitive electoral districts outcome seen voters foregone conclusion
proportional systems tend produce multiparty coalition governments reduce salience voters perceive little influence parties included coalition68 instance 2005 german election creation executive expressed voters majority party also result political dealmaking although guarantee lessened parties usually state favour coalition electionscitation needed
political scientists divided whether proportional representation increases voter turnout though countries proportional representation voter turnout higher697071 systems attempt preserve salience proportionality example mixed member proportional representation system zealand operation since 1996 germany several countries however tend complex electoral systems cases complexity appears suppress voter turnout72 dual system germany though seems negative impact voter turnout
ease votingedit
ease voting factor rates turnout united states latin american nations voters must separate voter registration procedures allowed vote twostep process quite clearly decreases turnout states easier registration requirements larger turnouts73 methods improving turnout include making voting easier available absentee polling improved access polls increasing number possible voting locations lowering average time voters spend waiting line requiring companies give workers time voting daywhich areas generally polling centres relatively inaccessible india elections often take several days countries considered internet voting possible solution countries like france voting held weekend voters away work therefore need time work factor voter turnout greatly reduced
many countries looked internet voting possible solution voter turnout countries like france switzerland internet voting however used sparingly states largely security concerns example department defense looked making internet voting secure cancelled effort74 idea would voter turnout would increase people could cast vote comfort homes although experiments internet voting produced mixed results75
voter fatigueedit
main article voter fatigue
voter fatigue lower turnout many elections close succession voter turnout decrease public tires participating lowturnout switzerland average voter invited polls average seven times year united states frequent elections votes year average includes levels government well primaries76 holding multiple elections time increase turnout however presenting voters massive multipage ballots occurs parts united states reduce turnouts77
measuring turnoutedit
differing methods measuring voter turnout contribute reported differences nations difficulties measuring numerator number voters cast votes denominator number voters eligible vote
numerator often assumed number voters went polls equal number ballots cast turn equal number votes counted case voters arrive polls necessarily cast ballots turned away ineligible turned away improperly sign voting register actually cast ballots furthermore voters cast ballots abstain deliberately voting nobody spoil votes either accidentally protest
united kingdom electoral commission distinguishes valid vote turnout excludes spoilt ballots ballot turnout
united states common report turnout votes race ballot jurisdictions report actual number people went polls number undervotes overvotes78 overvote rates around percent typical wellrun elections gadsden county florida overvote rate percent november 200079
denominator often assumed number eligible voters well defined case united states example accurate registry exactly eligible vote since 70–75 people choose register themselves80 thus turnout calculated based population estimates political scientists argued measures properly account large number illegal aliens disenfranchised felons persons considered mentally incompetent united states american voter turnout higher normally reported81 professor michael mcdonald constructed estimation turnout voting eligible population instead voting population american presidential elections 2004 turnout could expressed 6032 rather 5527 vapdead link82
zealand registration supposed universal eliminate uncertainty eligible population system shown unreliable large number eligible unregistered citizens creating inflated turnout figures83
second problem turnout measurements lies turnout computed count number voters count number ballots voteforone race number votes candidate necessarily identical voters sign polls necessarily cast ballots although ought voters cast spoiled ballots

trust government politicians decreased many nations however first signs decreasing voter turnout occurred early 1960s major upheavals late 1960s 1970s robert putnam argues collapse civil engagement introduction television 1950s 1960s television quickly became main leisure activity developed nations replaced earlier social entertainments bridge clubs church groups bowling leagues putnam argues people retreated within homes general social participation declined voting91
rosenstone hansen contend decline turnout united states product change campaigning strategies result socalled media introduction television almost partys resources would directed towards intensive local campaigning vote initiatives modern resources redirected expensive media campaigns potential voter passive participant92 period negative campaigning become ubiquitous united states elsewhere shown impact voter turnout93 attack smear campaigns give voters negative impression entire political process evidence mixed elections involving highly unpopular incumbents generally high turnout studies found mudslinging character attacks reduce turnout substantive attacks partys record increase it94
part reason voter decline recent 2016 election likely restrictive voting laws around country brennan center justice reported 2016 fourteen states passed restrictive voting laws95 examples laws photo mandates narrow times early voter limitations voter registration barbour wright also believe causes restrictive voting laws call system laws regulating electorate96 constitution gives states power make decisions regarding restrictive voting laws 2008 supreme court made crucial decision regarding indiana’s voter saying violate constitution since almost half states passed restrictive voting laws laws contribute barbour wrights idea rational nonvoter someone vote benefits voting outweighs cost vote96 laws “cost” voting reason make difficult vote united states programs mtvs rock vote vote initiatives introduced increase turnouts ages number governments electoral commissions also launched efforts boost turnout instance elections canada launched mass media campaigns encourage voting prior elections bodies taiwan united kingdom
google extensively studied causes behind voter turnout united states argues reasons behind lack voter participation socalled interested bystander97 according googles study adult americans classified interested bystanders politically informed reticent involve civic political sphere category limited socioeconomic demographic groups google theorizes individuals category suffer voter apathy interested political life believe individual effect would negligible98 individuals often participate politically local level away national elections
argued democratic consolidation stabilization democracies contributes decline voter turnout 2017 study challenges however99
