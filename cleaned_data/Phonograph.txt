strain gauge cartridgesedit
strain gauge semiconductor cartridges generate voltage like variable resistor whose resistance directly depends movement stylus thus cartridge modulates external voltage supplied special preamplifier pickups marketed euphonics panasonictechnics amongst others
main advantages compared magnetic carts

electrical connection cartridge preamplifier immune cable capacitance issues
nonmagnetic cartridge immune induced stray magnetic fields advantage shared ceramic cartridges
combination electrical mechanical advantages plus absence magnetic yoke highfrequency losses make especially suitable reproducing frequencies technics matsushita electric marketed line straingauge labeled semiconductor cartridges especially intended compatible discrete quadraphonic records requiring high frequency response bass response possible
using suitable mechanical arrangement vertical tracking angle stays steady independent stylus vertical movements consequent reduction related distortions
force sensor straingauge cartridge also measure actual vertical tracking force

main disadvantage need special preamplifier supplies steady current typically semiconductor elements handles special equalization needed magnetic cartridges
highend straingauge cartridge currently sold audiophile company special preamplifiers available
electrostatic cartridgesedit
electrostatic cartridges44 marketed stax 1950 1960 years needed individual operating electronics preamplifiers
optical readoutedit
specialist laser turntables read groove optically using laser pickup since physical contact record wear incurred however wear advantage debatable since vinyl records tested withstand even 1200 plays significant audio degradation provided played high quality cartridge surfaces clean45

stylus jukebox using shellac records 1940s


smoothtipped stylus popular usage often called needle former steel needles purpose used play recorded groove special chisellike stylus used engrave groove master record
stylus subject hard wear small part comes direct contact spinning record terms pressure imposed minute areas actual contact forces must bear enormous three desired qualities stylus first faithfully follows contours recorded groove transmits vibrations next part chain second damage recorded disc third resistant wear wornout damaged defective stylus degrade audio quality injure groove
different materials stylus used time thomas edison introduced sapphire 1892 diamond 1910 cylinder phonographs edison diamond disc players 1912–1929 properly played hardly ever required stylus changed styli vinyl records also made sapphire diamond specific case specific stylus type bang olufsens moving magnet cartridge 20cl mostly used parallel turntables 40026000 series uses sapphire stem diamond fixed special adhesive stylus mass milligram result full tracking requires gram stylus force reducing record wear even maximum distortion harmonic fell
edison european pathé disc machines early disc players external horn internal horn victrola style models normally used shortlived disposable needles common material steel although materials copper tungsten bamboo cactus used steel needles needed replaced frequently preferably rapid wear bearing heavily mildly abrasive shellac record rapid wear essential feature imprecisely formed tips would quickly worn compliance grooves contours advertisements implored customers replace steel needles record side steel needles inexpensive cents widely sold packets small tins available different thicknesses lengths thick short needles produced strong loud tones thinner longer needles produces softer muted tones 1916 face wartime steel shortage victor introduced tungstone brand extralongplaying needle advertised play records consisted brass shank hard strong tungsten wire somewhat narrower standard record groove fitted protruding wire wore worn short later hardened steel chromeplated needles came market claimed play record sides
sapphires introduced disc made tapering stem polishing sphere radius around micrometers respectively sphere equal form cutting stylus time diamond needles came market whole discussion started effect circular forms moving noncircular groove easily shown vertical called pinching movements result stereophonic introduced unwanted vertical modulation recognized problem also needle started life touching groove small surface giving extra wear walls




crosssection diagram comparing common types stylus spherical left elliptical right note difference contact area marked elliptical stylus allows groove contact area increases fidelity whereas spherical makes less contact groove generates less fidelity


another problem tapering along straight line side groove straight problems attacked together polishing diamond certain could made doubly elliptic side made ellipse seen behind meaning groove touched along short line ellipse form also polished seen curvature direction groove became much smaller micrometers micrometers approach number irregularities eliminated furthermore angle stylus used always sloping backwards changed forward direction line slope original cutting stylus possessed styli expensive produce costs effectively offset extended lifespans
next development stylus form came attention quadraphonic sound modulation process requires frequency response cartridges like technics epc100cmk4 capable playback frequencies requires stylus narrow side radius narrowprofile elliptical stylus able read higher frequencies greater increased wear since contact surface narrower overcoming problem shibata stylus invented around 1972 japan norio shibata jvc48 fitted standard quadraphonic cartridges marketed extra highend cartridges
shibatadesigned stylus offers greater contact surface groove turn means less pressure vinyl surface thus less wear positive side effect greater contact surface also means stylus read sections vinyl touched worn common spherical stylus demonstration records worn plays relatively high tracking force spherical stylus played shibata profile
advanced stylus shapes appeared following goal increasing contact surface improving shibata chronologically hughes shibata variant 197550 ogura 197851 198252 stylus marketed hyperelliptical shure alliptic fine line ortofon line contact audio technica polyhedron stereohedron stanton53
keelshaped diamond stylus appeared byproduct invention videodisc together laserdiamondcutting technologies made possible ridge shaped stylus namiki 198554 design fritz gyger 198955 design type stylus marketed microline audio technica microridge shure replicant ortofon53
important point stylus profiles still manufactured sold together common spherical elliptical profiles despite fact production quadraphonic records ended late 1970s
record materialsedit
early materials 19th century hardened rubber celluloid early 20th century shellac compound became standard since shellac hard enough withstand wear steel needles heavy tone arms filler made pulverized shale added shellac also fragile records often shattered cracked problem home records became bigger problem late 1920s vitaphone soundondisc motion picture talkie system developed 1927
solve problem 1930 victor made unbreakable records mixing polyvinyl chloride plasticisers proprietary formula called victrolac first used 1931 motion picture discs56 experimentally home records year however soundonfilm achieving supremacy soundondisc 1931 need unbreakable records diminished production vinyl home recordings dropped well time
victrolac formula improved throughout late30s material called vinylite used records sent radio stations radio program records radio commercials later copies phonograph records vinyl records could sent mail radio stations without breaking wwii shortage shellac imported asia government banned production shellac records duration vinylite made domestically though used vdiscs record company engineers took much closer look possibilities vinyl possibly might even replace shellac basic record material victor columbia leading records companies america perfected vinyl formats introduced 1948 33​1⁄3 introduced columbia single introduced victor years thereafter however records continued made shellac format phased around 1958
equalizationedit
early acoustical record players used stylus vibrate diaphragm radiated sound horn several serious problems resulted

maximum sound level achievable quite limited limited physical amplification effects horn
energy needed generate sound levels obtainable come directly stylus tracing groove required high tracking forces rapidly wore stylus record lateral records
bass sounds higher amplitude high frequency sounds perceived loudness space taken groove frequency sounds needed large limiting playback time side record accommodate bass notes high frequencies required tiny variations groove easily affected noise irregularities wear contaminates disc

introduction electronic amplification allowed issues addressed records made boosted high frequencies reduced frequencies allow different ranges sound produced reduces effect background noise including clicks pops also conserves amount physical space needed groove reducing size lowfrequency undulations
playback high frequencies must rescaled original flat frequency response—known equalization—as well amplified phono input amplifier incorporates equalization well amplification suit level output modern cartridge hifi amplifiers made 1950s 1990s virtually mixers equipped
