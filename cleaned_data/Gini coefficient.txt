gini coefficient usually defined mathematically based lorenz curve plots proportion total income population axis cumulatively earned bottom population diagram line degrees thus represents perfect equality incomes gini coefficient thought ratio area lies line equality lorenz curve marked diagram total area line equality marked diagram also equal fact since axes scale
people nonnegative income wealth case gini coefficient theoretically range complete equality complete inequality sometimes expressed percentage ranging practice extreme values quite reached negative values possible negative wealth people debts gini coefficient could theoretically normally mean total assumed positive rules gini coefficient less zero
