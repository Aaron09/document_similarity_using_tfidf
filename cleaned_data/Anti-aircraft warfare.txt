terminologyedit
term defence probably first used britain defence great britain adgb created royal force command 1925 however arrangements also called antiaircraft abbreviated term remained general 1950s first world sometimes prefixed light heavy classify type unit nicknames antiaircraft guns include triplea abbreviation antiaircraft artillery ackack spelling alphabet used british voice transmission archie world british term probably coined amyas borton believed derive royal flying corps musichall comedian george robeys line archibald certainly not3
nato defines antiaircraft warfare measures taken defend maritime force attacks airborne weapons launched aircraft ships submarines landbased sites4 armies term allarms defence aaad used defence nonspecialist troops terms late 20th century include gbad ground based related terms shorad short range manpads portable systems typically shoulderlaunched missiles antiaircraft missiles variously called surfacetoair missile abbreviated pronounced surface guided weapon sagw
nonenglish terms defence include german flak fliegerabwehrkanone aircraft defence cannon5 also cited flugabwehrkanone whence english flak russian term protivovozdushnaya oborona cyrillic противовозду́шная оборо́на literal translation antiair defence abbreviated pvo6 russian systems called zenitnye pointing zenith systems guns missiles french defence called défense contre aéronefs aéronef generic term kind airborne device aeroplane airship balloon missile rocket etc7
maximum distance missile engage aircraft important figure however many different definitions used unless definition used performance different guns missiles cannot compared guns ascending part trajectory usefully used term ceiling maximum ceiling height projectile would reach fired vertically practically useful guns able fire vertically maximum fuse duration short potentially useful standard compare different weapons
british adopted effective ceiling meaning altitude could deliver series shells moving target could constrained maximum fuse running time well guns capability late 1930s british definition height directly approaching target 6436 engaged seconds reaches degrees elevation8 however effective ceiling heavy guns affected nonballistic factors

maximum running time fuse maximum usable time flight
capability fire control instruments determine target height long range
precision cyclic rate fire fuse length calculated target would time flight firing meant knowing exactly round would fire

general descriptionedit

throughout 20th century defence fastestevolving areas military technology responding evolution aircraft exploiting various enabling technologies particularly radar guided missiles computing initially electromechanical analogue computing 1930s equipment described defence evolution covered areas sensors technical fire control weapons command control start 20th century either primitive nonexistent
initially sensors optical acoustic devices developed world continued 1930s9 quickly superseded radar turn supplemented optronics 1980s command control remained primitive late 1930s britain created integrated system10 adgb linked groundbased defence armys command although fielddeployed defence relied less sophisticated arrangements nato later called arrangements defence ground environment defined network ground radar sites command control centres within specific theatre operations used tactical control defence operations1
rules engagement critical prevent defences engaging friendly neutral aircraft assisted governed identification friend electronic devices originally introduced second world rules originate highest authority different rules apply different types defence covering area time aaad usually operates tightest rules
nato calls rules weapon control orders

weapons free weapon control order imposing status whereby weapons systems fired target positively recognised friendly
weapons tight weapon control order imposing status whereby weapons systems fired targets recognised hostile
weapons hold weapon control order imposing status whereby weapons systems fired selfdefence response formal order1

1950s guns firing ballistic munitions standard weapon guided missiles became dominant except shortest ranges however type shell warhead fuzing missiles guidance arrangement varied targets always easy destroy nonetheless damaged aircraft forced abort mission even manage return land friendly territory action days permanently ignoring small arms smaller machineguns groundbased defence guns varied calibre least mm11
groundbased defence deployed several ways

selfdefence ground forces using organic weapons aaad

area defence typically belts defence provide barrier sometimes umbrella covering area areas vary widely size extend along nations border cold mim23 hawk nike belts north–south across germany across military formations manoeuvre area city port ground operations defence areas used offensively rapid redeployment across current aircraft transit routes

defence included elements although second world fell disuse

tethered barrage balloons deter threaten aircraft flying height balloons susceptible damaging collisions steel tethers
searchlights illuminate aircraft night gunlayers optical instrument operators world searchlights became radar controlled
large smoke screens created large smoke canisters ground screen targets prevent accurate weapon aiming aircraft

interwar yearsedit
world demonstrated aircraft could important part battlefield nations prospect strategic attack main issue presenting threat opportunity experience four years attacks london zeppelins gotha bombers particularly influenced british main driver forming independent force capabilities aircraft engines improved clear role future would even critical range weapon load grew however years immediately world prospect another major seemed remote particularly europe militarily capable nations little financing available
four years seen creation technically demanding branch military activity defence made huge advances albeit starting point however often lacked influential friends competition share limited defence budgets demobilisation meant guns taken service leaving modern
however lessons learned particular british guns theatres action daylight used night attacks home furthermore also formed experimental section accumulated data subjected extensive analysis result published 1924–5 volume textbook antiaircraft gunnery included five recommendations equipment

shells improved ballistic shape fillings mechanical time fuses
higher rates fire assisted automation
height finding longbase optical instruments
centralised control fire position directed tachymetric instruments incorporating facility apply corrections moment meteorological wear factors
accurate soundlocation direction searchlights provide plots barrage fire

assumptions underpinned british approach fire first aimed fire primary method enabled predicting data visually tracking target height second target would maintain steady course speed height engage targets 24000 feet mechanical opposed igniferous time fuses required speed powder burning varied height fuse length simple function time flight automated fire ensured constant rate fire made easier predict shell individually aimed31

early 1930s eight countries developed radar developments sufficiently advanced late 1930s development work sound locating acoustic devices generally halted although equipment retained furthermore britain volunteer observer corps formed 1925 provided network observation posts report hostile aircraft flying britain initially radar used airspace surveillance detect approaching hostile aircraft however german würzburg radar capable providing data suitable controlling guns british radar designed used positions33
