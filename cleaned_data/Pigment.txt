synthetic ultramarine pigment chemically identical natural ultramarine


pigment material changes color reflected transmitted light result wavelengthselective absorption physical process differs fluorescence phosphorescence forms luminescence material emits light
many materials selectively absorb certain wavelengths light materials humans chosen developed pigments usually special properties make ideal coloring materials pigment must high tinting strength relative materials colors must stable solid form ambient temperatures
industrial applications well arts permanence stability desirable properties pigments permanent called fugitive fugitive pigments fade time exposure light eventually blacken
pigments used coloring paint plastic fabric cosmetics food materials pigments used manufacturing visual arts colorants usually ground fine powder powder added binder vehicle relatively neutral colorless material suspends pigment gives paint adhesion
distinction usually made pigment insoluble vehicle resulting suspension either liquid soluble vehicle resulting solution colorant either pigment depending vehicle involved cases pigment manufactured precipitating soluble metallic salt resulting pigment called lake pigment term biological pigment used colored substances independent solubility1

wide variety wavelengths colors encounter pigment pigment absorbs green light reflects blue creating color blue


pigments appear colors selectively reflect absorb certain wavelengths visible light white light roughly equal mixture entire spectrum visible light wavelength range nanometers light encounters pigment parts spectrum absorbed molecules ions pigment organic pigments diazo phthalocyanine compounds light absorbed conjugated systems double bonds molecule inorganic pigments vermilion mercury sulfide cadmium yellow cadmium sulfide absorb light transferring electron negative positive compounds designated chargetransfer complexes4 broad absorption bands subtract colors incident white light wavelengths parts spectrum reflected scattered reflected light spectrum creates appearance color pigments unlike fluorescent phosphorescent substances subtract wavelengths source light never ones
appearance pigments intimately connected color source light sunlight high color temperature fairly uniform spectrum considered standard white light artificial light sources tend great peaks parts spectrum deep valleys others viewed conditions pigments appear different colors

development synthetic pigments refinement techniques extracting mineral pigments batches color often inconsistent development modern color industry manufacturers professionals cooperated create international standards identifying producing measuring testing colors
first published 1905 munsell color system became foundation series color models providing objective methods measurement color munsell system describes color three dimensions value lightness chroma color purity chroma difference gray given value
middle 20th century standardized methods pigment chemistry available part international movement create standards industry international organization standardization develops technical standards manufacture pigments dyes standards define various industrial chemical properties test principal standards relate pigments follows

iso787 general methods test pigments extenders
iso8780 methods dispersion assessment dispersion characteristics

standards pertain particular classes categories pigments based chemical composition ultramarine pigments titanium dioxide iron oxide pigments forth
many manufacturers paints inks textiles plastics colors voluntarily adopted colour index international standard identifying pigments manufacturing particular colors first published 1925 published jointly society dyers colourists united kingdom american association textile chemists colorists index recognized internationally authoritative reference colorants encompasses 27000 products 13000 generic color index names
