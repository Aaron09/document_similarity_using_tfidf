north american numbering planedit
north american numbering plan closed numbering plan23 prescribes digits complete destination routing code including threedigit area code followed threedigit exchange four digits countries open numbering plans variablelength numbers finland subscriber numbers vary length even within exchange
early telephone systems connections made central office switchboard operators using patch cords connect party another telephone call initiated operating magneto hand generator usually part customers telephone alert centraloffice operator ringing switchboard bell activation electromechanical indicator drop response operator inserted patch cord corresponding line jack assisted customer voice patch cord connected caller destination telephone line destination party belonged another exchange operator established connection exchange another operator completed call setup technology advanced automatic electromechanical switches introduced telephones equipped rotary dials pulsedialing 1960s touchtone pads increased speed dialing enabled vertical telephone features
united states canada area codes first allocated 1947 large cities used soon operator routing codes connecting longdistance telephone calls toll switching centers4 first customerdialed longdistance calls possible englewood 1951 1966 system implemented fully countries5 users telephone system needed learn area code
bell system organized numbering plan minimize cost providing automatic dialing large population centers calls crossed area code boundaries required switched special toll switching systems thus number toll calls long distance common parlance calls minimized welldesigned geographical areas tributary routes placed area major toll center6 states anticipated require central offices technical limitation number plan split multiple areas receiving code middle digit area codes covered entire state digit middle contrast area code second digit threedigit exchange code never thus affording simple rule recognition whether user dialing full tendigit telephone number merely dialing within local area code using sevendigit dialing toll operators able differentiate types areas middle digit area code routing operator consulted7
1990s electromechanical central office switches replaced electronic switching system equipment previous area code logic longer necessary demand telephone numbers increasing rapidly remaining combinations insufficient sustain growth area code scheme abandoned result area codes central office codes could necessarily automatically distinguished switching equipment solution require dialing preceding calls across area codes case equipment expected digits first digit dialed digits expected area code inferred originating subscribers area code short area codes could enter full digits call within neighborhood enter last digits call would routed billed identically
rising popularity machines pagers required telephone numbers anticipated design numbering system remedy restrictions format area codes eased since 1995 area codes added north american numbering plan areas used area code splits existing numbering plan area split multiple divisions assigned area code thus many businesses required reprint business stationery catalogs directories area code splits often contested area could keep existing code usually fell largest city example split 1995 served miami fort lauderdale area dade county miamidade kept broward county fort lauderdale area change another method using area code overlays avoided renumbering existing stations overlay area code covers geographical area existing code overlays introduced since 19958
area code overlays invariably require tendigit dialing telephone numbers numbering plan area internet telephony services tied physical locations area codes often longer correspond physical location provider subscriber9
number structureedit
national telephone administrations issue telephone numbers conform e164 numbering plan e164 conformant telephone numbers consist country calling code national telephone number national telephone numbers defined national regional numbering plans european telephony numbering space north american numbering plan nanp number plan
numbering plans also decide routing signaling system signaling messages part global title public land mobile networks e212 numbering plan used subscriber identities stored e214 used routing database queries across pstn networks general structure telephone numbers issued within national telephone numbering plan follows international formats national standards within international system administered national plan unique country code
within national numbering plan complete destination telephone number composed area code subscriber telephone number subscriber number number assigned line connected customer equipment must dialed entiretycitation needed first digits subscriber number typically indicate smaller geographical areas individual telephone exchanges mobile networks indicate network provider callers given area country usually need include particular area prefixes dialing within area devices dial telephone numbers automatically include full number area access codes
country codeedit
country codes necessary dialing telephone numbers countries originating telephone dialed national telephone number convention international telephone numbers indicated prefixing country code plus sign meant indicate subscriber must dial international dialing prefix country call placed example international dialing prefix access code nanp countries european countries networks actual keypad code recognized automatically network carrier place international access code
area codeedit
many telephone numbering plans structured based divisions geographic areas service territory area identified plan assigned numeric routing code concept first developed operator toll dialing bell system early 1940s preceded north american numbering plan nanp 194710 system divided north american service territories numbering plan areas npas called numerical prefix numbering plan area code became known shortform area code area code prefixed telephone number assigned
national telecommunication authorities various formats dialing rules area codes initial design nanp threedigit format could digit either digit although area code ended code introduced tollfree service pattern assignment geographical areas avoided nearby areas similar area codes avoid confusion misdialed numbers 1995 expansion area codes centerdigit rule relaxed defining digit except middle digit reserved case threedigit area code pool exhausted augmented four digits
countries variety either fixedlength variable length area codes area codes consist digits brazil digit australia zealand variablelength formats exist germany digits argentina united kingdom japan austria syria peru
countries uruguay merged variablelength area codes telephone numbers fixedlength numbers must always dialed independently location closed dialing plans also closed numbering plan area code formally distinguished telephone number area codes first known subscriber trunk dialling codes depending local dialing plans often necessary dialed outside code area mobile phones north america tendigit dialing required areas overlay plans
strict correlation telephone geographical area broken technical advances especially voip service11
area code usually preceded dialing sequence either national access code many countries canada international access code country code however always case especially 10digit dialing used example montreal area codes users dial 10digit numbers 1234 dialing results recording advising dial local call nongeographic numbers well mobile telephones outside north american numbering plan area area code correlate particular geographic area however 1990s areas united states canada required dialing 7digit number within area code call beyond local tollfree area indicating caller wished make referred toll call
area codes often quoted including national access code example number london listed 7946 0321 users must correctly interpret code london call another station within london merely dial 7946 0321 dialing another country initial omitted country code 7946 0321
call pricing based area codesedit






section needs updated please update article reflect recent events newly available information november 2017



countries united states canada area codes generally determine cost call calls within area code often small group adjacent overlapping area codes normally charged lower rate outside area code necessarily case united states canada area codes cover sufficiently large territory different rates apply within area code toll rates determined distance rate centers area code central office prefix npanxx define rate center assigned geographic coordinates rate center local calling plan determines rate centers local call regardless distance tolls based tariff distance rate centers using formula

therefore calls nearby rate centers different area codes cheaper calls distant rate centers area code rates zones bands determined statebystate basis intrastate calls calls within state determined federal regulation interstate calls calls cross state line specific example callers falls church virginia rate center officially named washington zone va—example numbers begin 703534 v5636 h1600 make unmetered local calls nearby rate centers virginia maryland district columbia area codes calls distant locations manassas haymarket charged long distance
calls within state regulated states public utilities commission often higher rates call distant locations state regulated federal communications commission partial deregulation introduction competition longdistance phone services established methods determining call pricing necessarily follow traditional model year customers switch fixed rate allyoucandial plan covering state united states north america generally 2008 exclusive taxes approximately month competition cable telephony voice internet protocol services helped drive cost service residential business customers
special area codes generally used free premiumrate mobile phone systems countries mobile phone system caller pays specialrate numbers however exceptions countries egypt calls charged rate regardless area others area code occasionally treated areas different rates
landline telephony operators united states maintain separate pricing structure intralata phone calls also known local long distance tariff rate calls nearby areas greatly exceed rates long distance domestic calls side continent12
subscriber dialing proceduresedit
dial plan establishes expected sequence digits dialed subscriber premises equipment telephones private branch exchange systems telephone switches effect access telephone networks routing telephone calls effect activate specific service features local telephone company service
variety dial plans exist within numbering plan often depend network architecture local telephone operating company
within north american numbering plan administration defines standard permissive dialing plans specifying number mandatory digits dialed local calls within area code well alternate optional sequences adding trunk code telephone number
variablelength dialingedit
despite closed numbering plan different dialing procedures exist many territories local long distance telephone calls means call another number within city area callers need dial subset full telephone number example nanp 7digit number need dialed calls outside area full number including area code required situations itut recommendation e123 suggests list area code parentheses signifying cases area code optional required typically area code prefixed domestic trunk access code usually dialing inside country necessary calling countries exceptions italian land lines
call number sydney australia example

xxxx xxxx within sydney locations within south wales australian capital territory area code required
xxxx xxxx outside south wales australian capital territory still within australia area code required
xxxx xxxx outside australia

plus character markup signifies following digits country code case phones especially mobile telephones allow entered directly devices user must replace international access code current location
zealand special case dial plan nations require area code dialed different zealand needs dial area code phone outside local calling area example town waikouaiti dunedin city council jurisdiction phone numbers 7xxx call city council central dunedin 4000 residents must dial number full including area code even though area code waikouaiti dunedin different local calling areas palmerston dunedin respectively13
united states canada countries territories using north american numbering plan nanp international trunk access code also country calling code rule also applies many parts nanp including areas canada still variablelength dial plan universal locations within united states allow long distance calls within area code dialed seven digits canada domestic trunk code long distance access code must also dialed along area code long distance calls even within area code example call number regina area code regina rest province saskatchewan also served overlay code

xxxx within regina lumsden local areas
xxxx within saskatchewan within regina local calling area saskatoon
xxxx anywhere within nanp outside saskatchewan

call number oakland california area code dialing procedure varies

xxxx local longdistance within area code area code required
xxxx local longdistance outside within canada countries nanp longdistance trunk code
xxxx outside nanp country code

however parts north america especially area code overlays older area code dialing area code area code required even local calls dialing mobile phones different trunk code necessary although still necessary calling long distance numbers mobile phone canada mobile phones configured automatically frequentlycalled area code prefix allowing calls within desired area dialed user sevendigit numbers though sent phone 10digit numbers
parts united states especially northeastern states pennsylvania served verizon communications full 10digit number must dialed call local call fail unless dialed number preceded digit thus

xxxx local calls within area code overlay well calls neighboring area code overlay area code required completion options mobile phones within
xxxx calls numbers outside 610484 215267 area codes second completion options mobile phones within

california york existence overlay area codes area code must dialed every call nonoverlay area codes area code dialed calls outside subscribers home area code permissive home area code dialing area code within area code even area code required permitted since mid2000s decade example area code nonoverlay area code calls dialed digits xxxxxxx 1213 digits manner call dialed affect billing call permissive home area code dialing helps maintain uniformity eliminates confusion given different types area code relief made california nations area code intensive state unlike states overlay area codes texas maryland florida pennsylvania others california public utilities commission york state public service commission maintain different dial plans landlines must dial area code whenever area code part dialed digits cellphone users omit dial digits
many organizations private branch exchange systems permit dialing access digits outside line usually finally local area code xxxx areas without overlays aspect unintentionally helpful employees reside area code work area code three adjacent area codes dialing area code employee done quickly exceptions processed private branch exchange passed onto public switched telephone network
fullnumber dialingedit
small countries areas full telephone number used calls even area traditionally case small countries territories area codes required however trend many countries towards making numbers standard length incorporating area code subscribers number usually makes trunk code obsolete example call oslo norway 1992 necessary dial

within oslo area code required
within norway outside oslo
outside norway

1992 changed closed eightdigit numbering plan

22xx xxxx within norway including oslo
22xx xxxx outside norway

therefore countries france belgium japan switzerland south africa parts north america trunk code retained domestic calls whether local national

paris outside france xxxx xxxx
brussels xxxx outside belgium xxxx
geneva xxxx outside switzerland xxxx
cape town xxxx outside south africa xxxx
york xxxx outside north american numbering plan xxxx
fukuoka xxxx outside japanese numbering plan xxxx

like italy require initial zero dialed even calls outside country

rome xxxxxxxx outside italy xxxxxxxx

dialing full national numbers takes longer local number without area code increased phones store numbers means decreasing importance also makes easier display numbers international format trunk code required—hence number prague czech republic displayed

private numbering planedit
like public telecommunications network private telephone network enterprise within organizational campus implement private numbering plan installed base telephones internal communication networks operate private switching system private branch exchange within network internal numbers assigned often called extension numbers internal numbering plan extends official published main access number entire network caller within network dials extension number assigned another internal destination telephone
private numbering plan provides convenience mapping station telephone numbers commonly used numbering schemes enterprise example station numbers assigned room number hotel hospital station numbers also strategically mapped certain keywords composed letters telephone dial 4357 help reach help desk
internal number assignments independent direct inward dialing services provided external telecommunication vendors numbers without access internal switch relays externally originated calls operator automated attendant electronic interactive voice response system telephone numbers users within systems often published suffixing official telephone number extension number 18005550001 x2055
systems automatically large block numbers differing trailing sequence digits corresponding block individual internal stations allowing reached directly public switched telephone network cases special shorter dialin number used reach operator asked general information help looking connecting internal numbers example individual extensions universität saarlandes dialed directly outside fourdigit internal extension 49681302xxxx whereas universitys official main number 49681302015 country code germany area code saarbrücken prefix university
callers within private numbering plan often dial trunk prefix reach national international destination outside line access leased line tieline another location within enterprise large manufacturer factories offices multiple cities prefix followed internal routing code indicate city location individual four fivedigit extension number destination site common trunk prefix outside line north american systems digit followed outside destination number
