music timbre ˈtæmbər tambər also known tone color tone quality psychoacoustics perceived sound quality musical note sound tone timbre distinguishes different types sound production choir voices musical instruments string instruments wind instruments percussion instruments also enables listeners distinguish different instruments category oboe clarinet
physical characteristics sound determine perception timbre include spectrum envelope singers instrumental musicians change timbre music singingplaying using different singing playing techniques example violinist different bowing styles play different parts string obtain different timbres playing tasto produces light airy timbre whereas playing ponticello produces harsh even aggressive tone electric guitar electric piano performers change timbre using effects units graphic equalizers
simple terms timbre makes particular musical sound different sound another even pitch loudness instance difference sound guitar piano playing note volume instruments sound equally tuned relation play note playing amplitude level instrument still sound distinctively unique tone color experienced musicians able distinguish different instruments type based varied timbres even instruments playing notes pitch loudness
