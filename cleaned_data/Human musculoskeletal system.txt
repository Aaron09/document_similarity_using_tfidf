human musculoskeletal system also known locomotor system previously activity system1 organ system gives humans ability move using muscular skeletal systems musculoskeletal system provides form support stability movement body
made bones skeleton muscles cartilage2 tendons ligaments joints connective tissue supports binds tissues organs together musculoskeletal systems primary functions include supporting body allowing motion protecting vital organs3 skeletal portion system serves main storage system calcium phosphorus contains critical components hematopoietic system4
system describes bones connected bones muscle fibers connective tissue tendons ligaments bones provide stability body muscles keep bones place also play role movement bones allow motion different bones connected joints cartilage prevents bone ends rubbing directly onto muscles contract move bone attached joint

skeletal system serves many important functions provides shape form body support protection allows bodily movement produces blood body stores minerals5 number bones human skeletal system controversial topic humans born bones however many bones fuse together birth maturity result average adult skeleton consists bones number bones varies according method used derive count consider certain structures single bone multiple parts others single part multiple bones6 five general classifications bones long bones short bones flat bones irregular bones sesamoid bones human skeleton composed fused individual bones supported ligaments tendons muscles cartilage complex structure distinct divisions axial skeleton includes vertebral column appendicular skeleton7
functionedit
skeletal system serves framework tissues organs attach system acts protective structure vital organs major examples brain protected skull lungs protected cage
located long bones distinctions bone marrow yellow yellow marrow fatty connective tissue found marrow cavity starvation body uses yellow marrow energy8 marrow bones important site blood cell production approximately million blood cells second order replace existing cells destroyed liver5 erythrocytes platelets leukocytes form adults marrow erythrocytes platelets leukocytes migrate blood special tasks

three types muscles—cardiac skeletal smooth smooth muscles used control flow substances within lumens hollow organs consciously controlled skeletal cardiac muscles striations visible microscope components within cells skeletal smooth muscles part musculoskeletal system skeletal muscles move body cardiac muscles found heart used circulate blood like smooth muscles muscles conscious control skeletal muscles attached bones arranged opposing groups around joints9 muscles innervated communicate nervous energy to10 nerves conduct electrical currents central nervous system cause muscles contract11
contraction initiationedit
main article muscle contraction
mammals muscle contracts series reactions occur muscle contraction stimulated motor neuron sending message muscles somatic nervous system depolarization motor neuron results neurotransmitters released nerve terminal space nerve terminal muscle cell called neuromuscular junction neurotransmitters diffuse across synapse bind specific receptor sites cell membrane muscle fiber enough receptors stimulated action potential generated permeability sarcolemma altered process known initiation12
tendonsedit
main article tendon
tendon tough flexible band fibrous connective tissue connects muscles bones13 extracellular connective tissue muscle fibers binds tendons distal proximal ends tendon binds periosteum individual bones muscles origin insertion muscles contract tendons transmit forces relatively rigid bones pulling causing movement tendons stretch substantially allowing function springs locomotion thereby saving energy
joints ligaments bursaeedit
jointsedit
main article joint




human synovial joint composition


joints structures connect individual bones allow bones move cause movement divisions joints diarthroses allow extensive mobility articular heads false joints synarthroses joints immovable allow little movement predominantly fibrous synovial joints joints directly joined lubricated solution called synovial fluid produced synovial membranes fluid lowers friction articular surfaces kept within articular capsule binding joint taut tissue7
ligamentsedit
main article ligament
ligament small band dense white fibrous elastic tissue7 ligaments connect ends bones together order form joint ligaments limit dislocation prevent certain movements cause breaks since elastic increasingly lengthen pressure occurs ligament susceptible break resulting unstable joint
ligaments also restrict actions movements hyper extension hyper flexion restricted ligaments extent also ligaments prevent certain directional movement14
bursaeedit
main article bursa anatomy
bursa small fluidfilled made white fibrous tissue lined synovial membrane bursa also formed synovial membrane extends outside joint capsule8 provides cushion bones tendons andor muscles around joint bursa filled synovial fluid found around almost every major joint body
