statistical modeling regression analysis statistical processes estimating relationships among variables includes many techniques modeling analyzing several variables focus relationship dependent variable independent variables predictors specifically regression analysis helps understand typical value dependent variable criterion variable changes independent variables varied independent variables held fixed
commonly regression analysis estimates conditional expectation dependent variable given independent variables average value dependent variable independent variables fixed less commonly focus quantile location parameter conditional distribution dependent variable given independent variables cases function independent variables called regression function estimated regression analysis also interest characterize variation dependent variable around prediction regression function using probability distribution related distinct approach necessary condition analysis1 estimates maximum rather average value dependent variable given value independent variable ceiling line rather central line order identify value independent variable necessary sufficient given value dependent variable
regression analysis widely used prediction forecasting substantial overlap field machine learning regression analysis also used understand among independent variables related dependent variable explore forms relationships restricted circumstances regression analysis used infer causal relationships independent dependent variables however lead illusions false relationships caution advisable2 example correlation prove causation
many techniques carrying regression analysis developed familiar methods linear regression ordinary least squares regression parametric regression function defined terms finite number unknown parameters estimated data nonparametric regression refers techniques allow regression function specified functions infinitedimensional
performance regression analysis methods practice depends form data generating process relates regression approach used since true form datagenerating process generally known regression analysis often depends extent making assumptions process assumptions sometimes testable sufficient quantity data available regression models prediction often useful even assumptions moderately violated although perform optimally however many applications especially small effects questions causality based observational data regression methods give misleading results34
narrower sense regression refer specifically estimation continuous response dependent variables opposed discrete response variables used classification5 case continuous dependent variable specifically referred metric regression distinguish related problems6
