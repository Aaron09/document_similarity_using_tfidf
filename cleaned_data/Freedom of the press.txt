many traditional means delivering information slowly superseded increasing pace modern technological advance almost every conventional mode media information dissemination modern counterpart offers significant potential advantages journalists seeking maintain enhance freedom speech simple examples phenomena include

satellite television versus terrestrial television whilst terrestrial television relatively easy manage manipulate satellite television much difficult control journalistic content easily broadcast jurisdictions beyond control individual governments example middle east satellite broadcaster jazeera arabiclanguage media channel operates qatar whose government relatively liberal compared many neighboring states views content often problematic number governments region beyond however increased affordability miniaturisation satellite technology dishes receivers simply practicable states control popular access channel
internetbased publishing blogging social media traditional publishing traditional magazines newspapers rely physical resources offices printing presses easily targeted forced close internetbased publishing systems using ubiquitous inexpensive equipment operate global jurisdiction nations organisations increasingly resorting legal measures take control online publications using national security antiterror measures copyright laws issue takedown notices restrict opposition speech34
internet anonymity software strong cryptography addition internetbased publishing internet combination anonymity software cryptography allows sources remain anonymous sustain confidentiality delivering information securely communicating journalists anywhere world instant securedrop wikileaks
voice internet protocol voip conventional telephony although conventional telephony systems easily tapped recorded modern voip technology employ lowcost strong cryptography evade surveillance voip similar technologies become widespread likely make effective monitoring journalists contacts activities difficult task governments

naturally governments responding challenges posed media technologies deploying increasingly sophisticated technology notable example chinas attempts impose control staterun internet service provider controls access internet seems become increasingly difficult task journalists continue find ways exploit technology stay step ahead generally slowermoving government institutions attempt censor
