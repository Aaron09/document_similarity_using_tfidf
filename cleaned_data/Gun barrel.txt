historyedit
barrels usually metal however early chinese inventors gunpowder used bamboo strong naturally tubular stalk cheaper obtain process first barrels gunpowder projectile weapons fire lances2 chinese also first master castiron cannon barrels used technology make earliest infantry firearms hand cannons early european guns made wrought iron usually several strengthening bands metal wrapped around circular wrought iron rings welded hollow cylinder3 bronze brass favoured gunsmiths largely ease casting resistance corrosive effects combustion gunpowder salt water used naval vessels4
early firearms muzzleloading gunpowder shot loaded front muzzle barrel capable rate fire cumbersome loading process laterinvented breechloading designs provided higher rate fire early breechloaders lacked effective sealing escaping gases leaked back breech barrel reducing available muzzle velocity5 19th century effective breechblocks invented sealed breechloader escape propellant gases6
early cannon barrels thick caliber manufacturing defects bubbles trapped metal common back days played factors many explosions defects made barrel weak withstand pressures firing causing fail fragment explosively7

barrel howitzer 1944


barrel must able hold expanding produced propellants ensure optimum muzzle velocity attained projectile pushed barrel material cannot cope pressure within bore barrel might suffer catastrophic failure explode destroy also present lifethreatening danger people nearby modern small arms barrels made carbon steel stainless steel materials known tested withstand pressures involved artillery pieces made various techniques providing reliably sufficient strength89

flutingedit
main article fluting firearms




german army fluted barrel


firearms terminology fluting refers removal material cylindrical surface usually creating rounded grooves purpose reducing weight often done exterior surface rifle barrel though also applied cylinder revolver bolt boltaction rifle flutings rifle barrels revolver cylinders straight though helical flutings seen rifle bolts occasionally also rifle barrels
main purpose fluting reduce weight improve portability adequately done retain structural strength rigidity increase overall specific strength fluting also increase surfacetovolume ratio make barrel efficient cool firing though reduced material mass also means barrel heat easily firing

chamberedit
main article chamber firearms




cartridge chambered springfield m1903


chamber cavity back breechloading guns barrel cartridge inserted position ready fired firearms rifles shotguns machine guns pistols chamber integral part barrel often made simply reaming rear bore barrel blank single chamber within single barrel revolvers chamber component guns cylinder completely separate barrel single cylinder multiple chambers rotated turns alignment barrel anticipation fired
structurally chamber consists body shoulder neck contour closely correspond casing shape cartridge designed hold rear opening chamber breech whole barrel sealed tight behind bolt making front direction path least resistance firing cartridges primer struck firing propellant ignited deflagrates generating highpressure expansion within cartridge case however chamber restrains cartridge case shell shotguns moving allowing bullet shotsslug shotguns separate cleanly casing propelled forward along barrel exit front muzzle projectile
chambering refers process loading cartridge guns chamber either manually single loading operating weapons action pump action lever action bolt action selfloading actions case pellet casing retained entirely inserted chamber often called seating loading pellet rather chambering mechanically pressurized released behind pellet propels forward meaning gun’s chamber functionally equivalent freebore portion firearm barrel
context firearms design manufacturing modification word chambering different meaning refers fitting weapons chamber specifically fire particular caliber model cartridge

bore hollow internal lumen barrel takes vast majority portion barrel length part barrel projectile bullet pellet shot slug located prior firing gains speed kinetic energy firing process projectile’s status motion travelling bore referred internal ballistics
modern firearms except muskets shotguns artillery pieces guns except guns helical grooves called riflings machined bore wall shooting rifled bore imparts spin projectile longitudinal axis gyroscopically stabilizes projectiles flight attitude trajectory exit barrel external ballistics without riflings bore called smoothbore
firearm cartridge chambered casing occupies chamber bullet actually protrudes beyond chamber touches wall posterior bore even rifled bore short rear section without rifling called freebore length freebore contact bullet called leade transitions throat bore riflings begin area riflings impactfully “bite” moving bullet shooting subjected greatest thermomechanical stress therefore suffers wear fastest throat erosion often main determining factor guns barrel life
muzzleedit
also transitional ballistics




muzzle rifle equipped birdcagetype flash suppressor






various types shotgun chokes






muzzle blast modulated a2style flash suppressor


muzzle front barrel projectile exit10 precise machining muzzle crucial accuracy last point contact barrel projectile inconsistent gaps exist muzzle projectile escaping propellant gases spread unevenly deflect projectile intended path transitional ballistics muzzle also threaded outside allow attachment different accessory devices
rifled barrels contour muzzle designed keep rifling safe damage intruding foreign objects front ends rifling grooves commonly protected behind convex crown also serves modulate even expansion propellant gases crown often recessed outside muzzle avoid accidental damage collision surrounding environment
smoothbore barrels firing multiple subprojectiles shotgun shots bore muzzle might tapered constriction called choke shape scatter pattern better range accuracy chokes implemented either interchangeable screwin chokes particular applications fixed permanent chokes integral barrel
firing bright flash light known muzzle flash often seen muzzle flash produced superheated propellent gases radiating energy expansion primary flash incompletely combusted propellant residues reacting vigorously fresh supply ambient upon escaping barrel secondary flash size flash depends factors barrel length shorter barrels less time complete combustion hence unburnt powder type fast slowburning amount propellant higher total amount means likely unburnt residues loaded cartridge flash suppressors muzzle shrouds attached muzzle weapon either diminish conceal flash10
rapid expansion propellant gases muzzle firing also produce powerful shockwave known muzzle blast audible component blast also known muzzle report loud bang sound gunfire easily exceeds decibels cause permanent hearing loss shooter bystanders nonaudible component blast infrasonic overpressure wave cause damage nearby fragile objects accessory devices muzzle brakes muzzle boosters redirect muzzle blast order counter recoilinduced muzzle rise assist operation suppressors even muzzle shrouds used reduce blast noise intensity felt nearby personnels
