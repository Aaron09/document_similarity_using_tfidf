unique codes used governmental agencies universities businesses buildings receive extremely high volumes mail need codes government examples include 20505 central intelligence agency washington 81009 federal citizen information center general services administration gsa11 pueblo colorado examples private address unique codes include headquarters walmart 72716 empire state building 10118
example code 22313 used boxes main post office alexandria virginia used united states patent trademark office area surrounding post office home business mail delivery addresses code 22314 thus standard code
certain exceptional cases nominally standardtype code practice used three types example code 43210 columbus ohio listed standardtype code however since geographic boundaries essentially coterminous ohio state universitys main campus effectively exclusive university even though officially uniquetype code

despite geographic derivation codes codes represent geographic regions general correspond address groups delivery routes consequence code areas overlap subsets artificial constructs geographic area mail navy geographically fixed similar fashion areas without regular postal routes rural route areas mail delivery undeveloped areas codes assigned based sparse delivery routes hence boundary code areas undefined example residents near haubstadt indiana code 47639 mailing addresses 47648 code neighboring fort branch indiana others living near fort branch addresses 47639 many rural counties similar logistical inconsistencies caused aforementioned sparse delivery routes often known rural routes similar designation
example almost government agencies around capital assigned codes starting 20200 20599 washington codes even located washington white house located code 20006 code 20500 nuclear regulatory commission located rockville maryland code 20852 assigned postal service address washington 20555

codes address city name written line necessarily mean address within boundaries city postal service designates preferred place name code incorporated town city subentity large city unincorporated censusdesignated place small unincorporated community additional place names recognized acceptable certain code still others deemed acceptable used result delay mail delivery
preferred place names generally city town address located however many cities incorporated since codes introduced city name preferred place name many databases automatically assign preferred place name code without regard acceptable place names example centennial colorado divided among seven codes assigned aurora englewood littleton preferred place names none seven codes carries centennial preferred name code directory centennial addresses listed three cities since acceptable write centennial conjunction seven codes write centennial address aurora englewood littleton long shared codes
acceptable place names usually added code cases code boundaries divide cities case centennial however many cases preferred name used even many addresses code another city people sometimes must name post office rather city
extreme example code 85254 assigned place name scottsdale arizona served scottsdale post office territory inside city limits neighboring phoenix another notorious example entire neighborhood city angeles known beverly hills post office naturally residents prefer glamorous beverly hills address 90210 code regularly causes problems emergency response dispatchers sort whether given home 90210 angeles beverly hills
similarly missouri city texas straddles harris fort bend counties portion within harris county within code 77071 must city name houston instead missouri city time small portion city houston fort bend county code 77489 residents must name missouri city address even though houston
also occurs rural areas portions town mail delivered post offices example town plainfield massachusetts code 01070 sections town code area neighboring town cummington code 01026 preferred name cummington allowed code 01026 residents parts plainfield must list address cummington
phenomenon repeated across country previously mentioned englewood colorado innerring suburb built 1960s post office served area highgrowth southern tier denver metropolitan area codes area assigned englewood preferred place name business community large downtown denver grown area headquarters many internationally recognized corporations companies indicate englewood location preferred postal place name although located cities result really englewoods city small largely workingclass residential population number miles away postal englewood vast suburban area upscale subdivisions office parks nothing city englewood share split identity solely codes people live work englewood identify closely rarely enter city indiana code town usually indicates code corresponding township nearly indianas small town post offices rural routescitation needed
acceptable place names also come play areas citizens identify strongly particular urban center municipality example allegheny county pennsylvania distinct municipalities many countys residents even residents adjacent counties commonly pittsburgh pennsylvania postal address opposite spectrum urban areas neighborhood names acceptable even though legal standing jolla california preferred place name code 92037 despite fact jolla district diego california separate legal entity code also 919920 sequence used diego countys suburban rural areas sequence used remainder city diego even though jolla always part diego
many codes villages censusdesignated places portions cities entities municipalities example code 03750 etna hampshire etna city town village district town hanover assigned code 03755 another example code 08043 corresponds censusdesignated place kirkwood jersey serves entirety voorhees township also case lagrange york portion served 12603 code based neighboring town poughkeepsie rest lagrange served lagrangeville post office lagrangeville town section lagrange willow grove pennsylvania served 19090 code village straddles border upper moreland township abington township post office also serves small portion upper dublin township furthermore nonmunicipal place names also share codes municipal place names example west windsor township jersey commonly referred mailing databases princeton junction censusdesignated place within west windsor silver spring maryland 20815 2090120912 neither city town simply common name unincorporated area consisting large part lower southern portion montgomery county
postal designations place names become facto locations addresses result difficult convince residents businesses located another city town different preferred place name associated codes issues confusion lack identity cities signal hill california enclave located entirely inside separate city long beach successfully petitioned postal service change code boundaries create codes cities become preferred place name addresses within code
postal designation confusion financial implications local governments mail volume factor used census bureau estimate population changes decennial census enumerationscitation needed sometimes local officials community preferred place name code acceptable place name advise residents always name community census estimate towns population receive fewer funds computed based population typical example paddock lake wisconsin whose preferred place name salem paddock lake incorporated village within town salem even though people village paddock lake unincorporated parts town salem confusion caused silver lake wisconsin also village town salem similar size status paddock lake code post office
another case federal communications commission denied radio station wnnx move requiring change city license sandy springs georgia largely city municipal incorporation late 2005 despite seventhlargest place state population cited atlanta letters support local organizations even though usps forced atlanta 30328 well incorporation took effect currently sandy springs acceptable despite none 30328 atlanta anywhere else outside sandy springs city limit even applies code used boxes sandy springs main post office
codes associated place names ignore county lines problems occur street addresses based quadrant location within county example 30339 spans vinings georgia atlanta georgia southeastern cobb county therefore every street address labeled house number countys grid according distance town square county seat however usps demands atlanta vinings addresses written appear southeast atlanta instead opposite northwest metro atlanta side
division reallocation codesedit
like area codes codes sometimes divided changed especially rural area becomes suburban typically codes become effective announced grace period year provided codes used concurrently postal patrons affected area notify correspondents order stationery etc16
rapidly growing communities sometimes necessary open sectional center facility must allocated threedigit zipcode prefix prefixes allocation done various ways example sectional center facility opened dulles airport virginia prefix allocated facility therefore post offices served sectional center facility code changed code beginning code codes beginning however sectional center facility opened serve montgomery county maryland prefix assigned instead codes ranges previously assigned alphabetically reshuffled 207xx codes county changed 208xx codes 208xx codes outside county changed 207xx codes silver spring whose postal area includes wheaton prefix need apply reshuffling silver spring instead mail going 209xx codes simply rerouted sectional center facility
hand depopulation cause post office close associated code deallocated example centralia pennsylvanias code 17927 retired 200217
elkins park pennsylvania originally issued 19117 code although lies montgomery county pennsylvania prefix found philadelphia lone exception auto insurance companies charged higher city premiums suburban location reason residents petitioned usps 190prefix code common innerring pennsylvania suburbs city several attempts initially disapproved usps elkins park finally reassigned 19027 code
codes also change postal boundaries realigned example time abovenoted change montgomery county maryland took place pressure thenmayor washington marion barry usps realigned postal boundaries washington maryland match boundary previously many inner suburbs bethesda takoma park oxon hill temple hills suitland capitol heights washington postal area result change codes maryland beginning changed codes beginning depending location codes straddling dcmaryland line split example 20016 bethesda became 20816 maryland portion 20012 takoma park became 20912
