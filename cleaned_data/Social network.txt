theoretical linksedit
imported theoriesedit
various theoretical frameworks imported social network analysis prominent graph theory balance theory social comparison theory recently social identity approach46
indigenous theoriesedit
complete theories produced social network analysis structural role theory heterophily theory
basis heterophily theory finding study numerous weak ties important seeking information innovation cliques tendency homogeneous opinions well share many common traits homophilic tendency reason members cliques attracted together first place however similar member clique would also know less members knew find information insights members clique look beyond clique friends acquaintances granovetter called strength weak ties47
structural holesedit
context networks social capital exists people advantage location network contacts network provide information opportunities perspectives beneficial central player network social structures tend characterized dense clusters strong connections48 information within clusters tends rather homogeneous redundant nonredundant information often obtained contacts different clusters49 separate clusters possess nonredundant information said structural hole them49 thus network bridges structural holes provide network benefits degree additive rather overlapping ideal network structure vine cluster structure providing access many different clusters structural holes49
networks rich structural holes form social capital offer information benefits main player network bridges structural holes able access information diverse sources clusters49 example business networks beneficial individuals career likely hear openings opportunities network spans wide range contacts different industriessectors concept similar mark granovetters theory weak ties rests basis broad range contacts effective attainment
research clustersedit
communicationedit
communication studies often considered part social sciences humanities drawing heavily fields sociology psychology anthropology information science biology political science economics well rhetoric literary studies semiotics many communication concepts describe transfer information source another thus conceived terms network
communityedit
barnes community referred specific geographic location studies community ties talked associated traded attended church today however extended online communities developed telecommunications devices social network services devices services require extensive ongoing maintenance analysis often using network science methods community development studies today also make extensive methods
complex networksedit
complex networks require methods specific modelling interpreting social complexity complex adaptive systems including techniques dynamic network analysis mechanisms dualphase evolution explain temporal changes connectivity contribute formation structure social networks
criminal networksedit
criminology urban sociology much attention paid social networks among criminal actors example andrew papachristos50 studied gang murders series exchanges gangs murders seen diffuse outwards single source weaker gangs cannot afford kill members stronger gangs retaliation must commit violent acts maintain reputation strength
diffusion innovationsedit
diffusion ideas innovations studies focus spread ideas actor another culture another line research seeks explain become early adopters ideas innovations links social network structure facilitating impeding spread innovation
demographyedit
demography study social networks sampling methods estimating reaching populations hard enumerate example homeless people intravenous drug users example respondent driven sampling networkbased sampling technique relies respondents survey recommending respondents
economic sociologyedit
field sociology focuses almost entirely networks outcomes social interactions narrowly economic sociology considers behavioral interactions individuals groups social capital social markets sociologists mark granovetter developed core principles interactions social structure information ability punish reward trust frequently recur analyses political economic institutions granovetter examines social structures social networks affect economic outcomes like hiring price productivity innovation describes sociologists contributions analyzing impact social structure networks economy51
health careedit
analysis social networks increasingly incorporated health care analytics epidemiological studies also models patient communication education disease prevention mental health diagnosis treatment study health care organizations systems52
human ecologyedit
human ecology interdisciplinary transdisciplinary study relationship humans natural social built environments scientific philosophy human ecology diffuse history connections geography sociology psychology anthropology zoology natural ecology5354
language linguisticsedit
studies language linguistics particularly evolutionary linguistics focus development linguistic forms transfer changes sounds words language system another networks social interaction social networks also important language shift groups people andor abandon languages repertoire
literary networksedit
study literary systems network analysis applied anheier gerhards romo55 nooy56 senekal57 study various aspects literature functions basic premise polysystem theory around since writings evenzohar integrated network theory relationships different actors literary network writers critics publishers literary histories mapped using visualization
organizational studiesedit
research studies formal informal organization relationships organizational communication economics economic sociology resource transfers social networks also used examine organizations interact characterizing many informal connections link executives together well associations connections individual employees different organizations58 intraorganizational networks found affect organizational commitment59 organizational identification37 interpersonal citizenship behaviour60
social capitaledit
social capital form economic cultural capital social networks central transactions marked reciprocity trust cooperation market agents produce goods services mainly common good
social capital sociological concept value social relations role cooperation confidence achieve positive outcomes term refers value social ties example newly arrived immigrants make social ties established migrants acquire jobs otherwise trouble getting unfamiliarity local language positive relationship exists social capital intensity social network use6162 dynamic framework higher activity network feeds higher social capital encourages activity63
network position benefitsedit
many organizations members tend focus activities inside groups stifles creativity restricts opportunities player whose network bridges structural holes advantage detecting developing rewarding opportunities48 player mobilize social capital acting broker information clusters otherwise would contact thus providing access ideas opinions opportunities british philosopher political economist john stuart mill writes hardly possible overrate value placing human beings contact persons dissimilar communication primary sources progress64 thus player network rich structural holes value organization ideas opportunities turn helps individuals career development advancement
social capital broker also reaps control benefits facilitator information flow contacts case consulting firm eden mccallum founders able advance careers bridging connections former three consulting firm consultants midsize industry firms65 bridging structural holes mobilizing social capital players advance careers executing opportunities contacts
research substantiates refutes benefits information brokerage study high tech chinese firms zhixing xiao found control benefits structural holes dissonant dominant firmwide spirit cooperation information benefits cannot materialize communal sharing values organizations66 however study analyzed chinese firms tend strong communal sharing values information control benefits structural holes still valuable firms quite inclusive cooperative firmwide level 2004 ronald burt studied managers supply chain americas largest electronics companies found managers often discussed issues groups better paid received positive evaluations likely promoted48 thus bridging structural holes beneficial organization turn individuals career
social mediaedit
main article social media
computer networks combined social networking software produces medium social interaction relationship computerized social networking service characterized context direction strength content relation refers resource exchanged computer mediated communication context social pairs exchange different kinds information including sending data file computer program well providing emotional support arranging meeting rise electronic commerce information exchanged also correspond exchanges money goods services real world67 social network analysis methods become essential examining types computer mediated communication
addition sheer size volatile nature social media given rise network metrics concern networks extracted social media lack robustness network metrics given missing data68
