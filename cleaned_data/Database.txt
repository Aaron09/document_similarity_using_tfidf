introduction term database coincided availability directaccess storage disks drums mid1960s onwards term represented contrast tapebased systems past allowing shared interactive rather daily batch processing oxford english dictionary cites11 1962 report system development corporation california first term database specific technical sense
computers grew speed capability number generalpurpose database systems emerged mid1960s number systems come commercial interest standard began grow charles bachman author product integrated data store founded database task group within codasyl group responsible creation standardization cobol 1971 database task group delivered standard generally became known codasyl approach soon number commercial products based approach entered market
codasyl approach relied manual navigation linked data formed large network applications could find records three methods

primary known calc typically implemented hashing
navigating relationships called sets record another
scanning records sequential order

later systems added btrees provide alternate access paths many codasyl databases also added straightforward query language however final tally codasyl complex required significant training effort produce useful applications

external conceptual internal viewsedit




traditional view data30


database management system provides three views database data

external level defines group endusers sees organization data database single database number views external level
conceptual level unifies various external views compatible global view31 provides synthesis external views scope various database endusers rather interest database application developers database administrators
internal level physical level internal organization data inside dbms concerned cost performance scalability operational matters deals storage layout data using storage structures indexes enhance performance occasionally stores data individual views materialized views computed generic data performance justification exists redundancy balances external views performance requirements possibly conflicting attempt optimize overall performance across activities

typically conceptual logical physical internal view data number different external views allows users database information businessrelated rather technical processing viewpoint example financial department company needs payment details employees part companys expenses need details employees interest human resources department thus different departments need different views companys database
threelevel database architecture relates concept data independence major initial driving forces relational model idea changes made certain level affect view higher level example changes internal level affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces reduces impact making physical changes improve performance
conceptual view provides level indirection internal external hand provides common view database independent different external view structures hand abstracts away details data stored managed internal level principle every level even every external view presented different data model practice usually given dbms uses data model external conceptual levels relational model internal level hidden inside dbms depends implementation requires different level detail uses types data structure types
separating external conceptual internal levels major feature relational database model implementations dominate 21st century databases31
