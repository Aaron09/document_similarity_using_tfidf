literal rule judge actual legislation states rather trying judge thinks means judge plain everyday ordinary meaning words even produces unjust undesirable outcome good example problems method maginnis 198732 several judges separate opinions found several different dictionary meanings word supply another example fisher bell held shopkeeper placed illegal item shop window price make offer sell specific meaning offer sale contract result case parliament amended statute concerned discrepancy
golden rule used literal rule would obviously create absurd result court must find genuine difficulties declines literal ruleverification needed ways golden rule applied narrow method broad method narrow method apparently contradictory meanings word used legislative provision ambiguous least absurd used example adler george 1964 defendant found guilty official secrets 1920 said offence obstruct forces vicinity prohibited place adler argued vicinity prohibited place actually prohibited place33 court chose accept wording literally broad method court reinterpret clear read statute occurred sigsworth 1935 murdered mother forbidden inheriting estate despite statute contrary
mischief rule flexible interpretation methods stemming heydons case 1584 allows court enforce statute intended remedy rather words actually example corkery carpenter 1950 found guilty drunk charge carriage although fact bicycle
statutory interpretation united statesedit
