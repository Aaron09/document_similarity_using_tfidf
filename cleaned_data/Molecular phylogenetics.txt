historyedit
information history molecular evolution
theoretical frameworks molecular systematics laid 1960s works emile zuckerkandl emanuel margoliash linus pauling walter fitch3 applications molecular systematics pioneered charles sibley birds herbert dessauer herpetology morris goodman primates followed allan wilson robert selander john avise studied various groups work protein electrophoresis began around 1956 although results quantitative initially improve morphological classification provided tantalizing hints longheld notions classifications birds example needed substantial revision period 1974–1986 dnadna hybridization dominant technique4
techniques applicationsedit
every living organism contains proteins general closely related organisms high degree agreement molecular structure substances molecules organisms distantly related usually show pattern dissimilarity conserved sequences mitochondrial expected accumulate mutations time assuming constant rate mutation provides molecular clock dating divergence molecular phylogeny uses data build relationship tree shows probable evolution various organisms invention sanger sequencing 1977 became possible isolate identify molecular structures56 highthroughput sequencing also used obtain transcriptome organism allowing inference phylogenetic relationships using transcriptomic data
common approach comparison homologous sequences genes using sequence alignment techniques identify similarity another application molecular phylogeny barcoding wherein species individual organism identified using small sections mitochondrial chloroplast another application techniques make possible seen limited field human genetics evermorepopular genetic testing determine childs paternity well emergence branch criminal forensics focused evidence known genetic fingerprinting
comprehensive stepbystep protocol constructing phylogenetic tree including dnaamino acid contiguous sequence assembly multiple sequence alignment modeltest testing bestfitting substitution models phylogeny reconstruction using maximum likelihood bayesian inference available nature protocol7
theoretical backgroundedit
early attempts molecular systematics also termed chemotaxonomy made proteins enzymes carbohydrates molecules separated characterized using techniques chromatography replaced recent times largely sequencing produces exact sequences nucleotides bases either segments extracted using different techniques general considered superior evolutionary studies since actions evolution ultimately reflected genetic sequences present still long expensive process sequence entire organism genome however quite feasible determine sequence defined area particular chromosome typical molecular systematic analyses require sequencing around 1000 base pairs location within sequence bases found given position vary organisms particular sequence found given organism referred haplotype principle since four base types 1000 base pairs could 41000 distinct haplotypes however organisms within particular species group related species found empirically minority sites show variation variations found correlated number distinct haplotypes found relatively small
molecular systematic analysis haplotypes determined defined area genetic material substantial sample individuals target species taxon used however many current studies based single individuals haplotypes individuals closely related different taxa also determined finally haplotypes smaller number individuals definitely different taxon determined referred group base sequences haplotypes compared simplest case difference haplotypes assessed counting number locations different bases referred number substitutions kinds differences haplotypes also occur example insertion section nucleic acid haplotype present another difference organisms usually reexpressed percentage divergence dividing number substitutions number base pairs analysed hope measure independent location length section sequenced
older superseded approach determine divergences genotypes individuals dnadna hybridisation advantage claimed using hybridisation rather gene sequencing based entire genotype rather particular sections modern sequence comparison techniques overcome objection multiple sequences
divergences pairs samples determined resulting triangular matrix differences submitted form statistical cluster analysis resulting dendrogram examined order whether samples cluster would expected current ideas taxonomy group group haplotypes similar another haplotype said constitute clade statistical techniques bootstrapping jackknifing help providing reliability estimates positions haplotypes within evolutionary trees
limitations molecular systematicsedit
molecular systematics essentially cladistic approach assumes classification must correspond phylogenetic descent valid taxa must monophyletic
recent discovery extensive horizontal gene transfer among organisms provides significant complication molecular systematics indicating different genes within organism different phylogenies
addition molecular phylogenies sensitive assumptions models making face problems like longbranch attraction saturation taxon sampling problems means strikingly different results obtained applying different models dataset8
