dormancyedit
main article seed dormancy
seed dormancy main functions first synchronizing germination optimal conditions survival resulting seedling second spreading germination batch seeds time catastrophe late frosts drought herbivory result death offspring plant bethedging23 seed dormancy defined seed failing germinate environmental conditions optimal germination normally environment suitable temperature proper soil moisture true dormancy innate dormancy therefore caused conditions within seed prevent germination thus dormancy state seed environment24 induced dormancy enforced dormancy seed quiescence occurs seed fails germinate external environmental conditions inappropriate germination mostly response conditions dark light cold
seed dormancy seed persistence soil plant though even scientific publications dormancy persistence often confused used synonyms25
often seed dormancy divided four major categories exogenous endogenous combinational secondary recent system distinguishes five classes morphological physiological morphophysiological physical combinational dormancy26
exogenous dormancy caused conditions outside embryo including

physical dormancy hard seed coats occurs seeds impermeable water dormancy break specialized structure ‘water gap’ disrupted response environmental cues especially temperature water enter seed germination occur plant families physical dormancy occurs include anacardiaceae cannaceae convulvulaceae fabaceae malvaceae27
chemical dormancy considers species lack physiological dormancy chemical prevents germination chemical leached seed rainwater snow melt deactivated somehow28 leaching chemical inhibitors seed rain water often cited important cause dormancy release seeds desert plants little evidence exists support claim29

endogenous dormancy caused conditions within embryo including

morphological dormancy germination prevented morphological characteristics embryo species embryo mass cells seeds dispersed differentiated germination take place differentiation growth embryo occur species embryo differentiated fully grown underdeveloped dispersal embryo growth species specific length required germination occur examples plant families morphological dormancy occurs apiaceae cycadaceae liliaceae magnoliaceae ranunculaceae3031
morphophysiological dormancy includes seeds underdeveloped embryos also physiological components dormancy seeds therefore require dormancybreaking treatments well period time develop fully grown embryos plant families morphophysiological dormancy occurs include apiaceae aquifoliaceae liliaceae magnoliaceae papaveraceae ranunculaceae30 plants morphophysiological dormancy asarum trillium species multiple types dormancy affects radicle root growth affects plumule shoot growth terms double dormancy twoyear seeds used species whose seeds need years complete germination least winters summer dormancy radicle seedling root broken first winter dispersal dormancy shoot broken second winter30
physiological dormancy means embryo physiological causes cannot generate enough power break seed coat endosperm covering structures dormancy typically broken cool warm warm conditions abscisic acid usually growth inhibitor seeds production affected light

drying plants including number grasses seasonally arid regions needed germinate seeds released need lower moisture content germination begin seeds remain moist dispersal germination delayed many months even years many herbaceous plants temperate climate zones physiological dormancy disappears drying seeds species germinate dispersal narrow temperature ranges seeds able germinate wider temperature range32


seeds combinational dormancy seed fruit coat impermeable water embryo physiological dormancy depending species physical dormancy broken physiological dormancy broken31
secondary dormancy caused conditions seed dispersed occurs seeds nondormant seed exposed conditions favorable germination often high temperatures mechanisms secondary dormancy fully understood might involve loss sensitivity receptors plasma membrane33

following types seed dormancy involve seed dormancy strictly speaking lack germination prevented environment characteristics seed germination

photodormancy light sensitivity affects germination seeds photoblastic seeds need period darkness light germinate species thin seed coats light able penetrate dormant embryo presence light absence light trigger germination process inhibiting germination seeds buried deeply others buried soil
thermodormancy seed sensitivity heat cold seeds including cocklebur amaranth germinate high temperatures many plants seeds germinate early midsummer thermodormancy germinate soil temperature warm seeds need cool soils germinate others celery inhibited soil temperatures warm often thermodormancy requirements disappear seed ages dries

seeds undergo period dormancy seeds mangroves viviparous begin germinate still attached parent large heavy root allows seed penetrate ground falls many garden plant seeds germinate readily soon water warm enough though wild ancestors dormancy cultivated plants lack many generations selective pressure plant breeders gardeners dormancy selected

inducing germinationedit
number different strategies used gardeners horticulturists break seed dormancy
scarification allows water gases penetrate seed includes methods physically break hard seed coats soften chemicals soaking water poking holes seed rubbing sandpaper cracking press hammer sometimes fruits harvested seeds still immature seed coat fully developed sown right away seed coat become impermeable natural conditions seed coats worn rodents chewing seed seeds rubbing rocks seeds moved wind water currents undergoing freezing thawing surface water passing animals digestive tract latter case seed coat protects seed digestion often weakening seed coat embryo ready sprout deposited along fecal matter acts fertilizer parent plant microorganisms often effective breaking hard seed coats sometimes used people treatment seeds stored moist warm sandy medium several months nonsterile conditions
stratification also called moistchilling breaks physiological dormancy involves addition moisture seeds absorb water subjected period moist chilling afterripen embryo sowing late summer fall allowing overwinter cool conditions effective stratify seeds seeds respond favorably periods oscillating temperatures part natural environment
leaching soaking water removes chemical inhibitors seeds prevent germination rain melting snow naturally accomplish task seeds planted gardens running water best—if soaked container hours soaking sufficient soaking longer especially stagnant water result oxygen starvation seed death seeds hard seed coats soaked water break open impermeable cell layers prevent water intake
methods used assist germination seeds dormancy include prechilling predrying daily alternation temperature light exposure potassium nitrate plant growth regulators gibberellins cytokinins ethylene thiourea sodium hypochlorite others43 seeds germinate best fire seeds fire cracks hard seed coats others chemical dormancy broken reaction presence smoke liquid smoke often used gardeners assist germination species44
