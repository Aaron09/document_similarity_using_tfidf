1917 einstein applied general theory relativity structure universe whole172 discovered general field equations predicted universe dynamic either contracting expanding observational evidence dynamic universe known time einstein introduced term cosmological constant field equations order allow theory predict static universe modified field equations predicted static universe closed curvature accordance einsteins understanding machs principle years model became known einstein world einsteins static universe173174
following discovery recession nebulae edwin hubble 1929 einstein abandoned static model universe proposed dynamic models cosmos friedmanneinstein universe 1931175176 einstein–de sitter universe 1932177178 models einstein discarded cosmological constant claiming case theoretically unsatisfactory175176179
many einstein biographies claimed einstein referred cosmological constant later years biggest blunder astrophysicist mario livio recently cast doubt claim suggesting exaggerated180
late 2013 team irish physicist cormac oraifeartaigh discovered evidence shortly learning hubbles observations recession nebulae einstein considered steadystate model universe181182 hitherto overlooked manuscript apparently written early 1931 einstein explored model expanding universe density matter remains constant continuous creation matter process associated cosmological constant183184 stated paper follows would like draw attention solution equation account hubbels facts density constant time considers physically bounded volume particles matter continually leaving density remain constant particles matter must continually formed volume space
thus appears einstein considered steadystate model expanding universe many years hoyle bondi gold185186 however einsteins steadystate model contained fundamental flaw quickly abandoned idea183184187
