humid continental climate köppen prefix third letter climatic region defined russogerman climatologist wladimir köppen 19001 typified large seasonal temperature differences warm often humid summers cold sometimes severely cold winters precipitation usually well distributed year definition climate regarding temperature follows mean temperature coldest month must must least four months whose mean temperatures climatologists prefer isotherm commonly used addition location question must semiarid arid subtypes also known hemiboreal
humid continental climates tend found latitudes within central northeastern portions north america europe asia much less commonly found southern hemisphere larger ocean area latitude consequent greater maritime moderation northern hemisphere humid continental climates typically scandinavia nova scotia newfoundland heavily maritimeinfluenced relatively cool summers winters freezing mark3 extreme humid continental climates found southern siberia american midwest combine hotter summer maxima colder winters marinebased variety areas strong subtropical subarctic mass influences depending season like humid summers frigid winters milwaukee wisconsin4 upper midwest united states

climatological averages used determine locations within certain climate regime world meteorological organization defined average 30year period version 1936 utilized mean temperature coldest month must least four months whose mean temperatures temperatures arbitrary europe average temperature isotherm line equal temperature near southern extent winter snowpack many climatologists prefer standard feel better reflects consistency regional landscapes average temperature found minimum temperature necessary tree growth6 wide temperature ranges common within climate zone7
addition location question must semiarid arid update climate regime definition introduced trewartha horn 1980 despite 1980 update climate regimes essentially within southern hemisphere largest changes seen north america europe northern asia1
köppen following variants climate possible climate regime uses three letter code beginning letter otherwise8

second letter

meet either alternative specifications
summer driest summer month millimetres rainfall ​1⁄3 precipitation wettest winter month
winter driest winter month one‑tenth precipitation found wettest summer month


third letter

warmest month averages
meet requirements still least four months



associated precipitationedit
