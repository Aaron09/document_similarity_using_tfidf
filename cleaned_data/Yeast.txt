word yeast comes english gist gyst indoeuropean root meaning boil foam bubble13 yeast microbes probably earliest domesticated organisms archaeologists digging egyptian ruins found early grinding stones baking chambers yeastraised bread well drawings 4000yearold bakeries breweries14 1680 dutch naturalist anton leeuwenhoek first microscopically observed yeast time consider living organisms rather globular structures15 researchers doubtful whether yeasts algae fungi16 1837 theodor schwann recognized fungi1718
1857 french microbiologist louis pasteur proved paper mémoire fermentation alcoolique alcoholic fermentation conducted living yeasts chemical catalyst1419 pasteur showed bubbling oxygen yeast broth cell growth could increased fermentation inhibited observation later called pasteur effect
late 18th century yeast strains used brewing identified saccharomyces cerevisiae topfermenting yeast carlsbergensis bottomfermenting yeast cerevisiae sold commercially dutch breadmaking since 1780 around 1800 germans started producing cerevisiae form cream 1825 method developed remove liquid yeast could prepared solid blocks20 industrial production yeast blocks enhanced introduction filter press 1867 1872 baron springer developed manufacturing process create granulated yeast technique used first world war21 united states naturally occurring airborne yeasts used almost exclusively commercial yeast marketed centennial exposition 1876 philadelphia charles fleischmann exhibited product process well serving resultant baked bread22
nutrition growth
yeasts chemoorganotrophs organic compounds source energy require sunlight grow carbon obtained mostly hexose sugars glucose fructose disaccharides sucrose maltose species metabolize pentose sugars ribose23 alcohols organic acids yeast species either require oxygen aerobic cellular respiration obligate aerobes anaerobic also aerobic methods energy production facultative anaerobes unlike bacteria known yeast species grow anaerobically obligate anaerobes yeasts grow best neutral slightly acidic environment
yeasts vary regard temperature range grow best example leucosporidium frigidum grows saccharomyces telluris candida slooffi °f24 cells survive freezing certain conditions viability decreasing time
general yeasts grown laboratory solid growth media liquid broths common media used cultivation yeasts include potato dextrose agar potato dextrose broth wallerstein laboratories nutrient agar yeast peptone dextrose agar yeast mould agar broth home brewers cultivate yeast frequently dried malt extract agar solid growth medium antibiotic cycloheximide sometimes added yeast growth media inhibit growth saccharomyces yeasts select wildindigenous yeast species change yeast process
