20th century seek jobs escape racial violence african americans left south great migration second great migration moving northern midwestern western cities compete recent european immigrants
especially transportation systems improved centuries become relatively easy many americans move part country another given lack internal borders dominance english areas many reasons economic opportunity climate culture
american industrial revolution promoted urbanization previously largely agrarian society
railroads promoting migration westwards streetcar suburbs created significant ethnic shifts urban areas
economics natural disasters driven migration example dust bowl world since decline rust belt
suburbanization period world white flight housing away later social unrest followed black flight
majority native hawaiians moved mainland settled california
