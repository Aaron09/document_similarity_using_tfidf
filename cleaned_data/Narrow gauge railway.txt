woodcut metallica showing narrowgauge railway mine 1556






train bubendorf station gauge waldenburg railway liestal waldenburg switzerland


earliest recorded railway shown metallica 1556 shows mine bohemia railway gauge 16th century railways mainly restricted handpushed narrowgauge lines mines throughout europe later 17th century mine railways extended provide transportation ground lines industrial connecting mines nearby transportation points usually canals waterways railways usually built narrow gauge mine railways developed1
worlds first steam locomotive rails built 1802 richard trevithick coalbrookdale company plateway 1820s 1830s number industrial narrowgauge railways united kingdom used steam locomotives 1842 first narrowgauge steam locomotive outside built 1100 5⁄16 gauge antwerpghent railway belgium first steam locomotives public passengercarrying narrowgauge railway came 1865 ffestiniog railway introduced passenger service receiving first locomotives years prior2
historically many narrowgauge railways built part specific industrial enterprises primarily industrial railways rather general carriers common uses industrial narrowgauge railways mining logging construction tunnelling quarrying conveying agricultural products extensive narrowgauge networks constructed many parts world purposes example mountain logging operations 19th century often used narrowgauge railways transport logs mill sites market significant sugarcane railways still operate cuba fiji java philippines queensland narrowgauge railway equipment remains common construction tunnels
extensive narrowgauge railway systems served frontline trenches sides world shortlived military application surplus equipment created small boom narrowgauge railway building europe
advantagesedit
narrowgauge railways usually cost less build usually lighter construction using smaller cars locomotives smaller loading gauge well smaller bridges smaller tunnels smaller structure gauge tighter curves narrow gauge thus often used mountainous terrain savings civil engineering work substantial also used sparsely populated areas potential demand broader gauge railways economically viable case australia southern africa extremely poor soils population densities standard gauge viable
temporary railways removed shortterm construction logging industry mining industry largescale construction projects especially confined spaces channel tunnel narrowgauge railway substantially cheaper easier install remove railways almost vanished capabilities modern trucks
many countries narrow gauge railways built feeder branch lines feed traffic important standard gauge lines lower construction costs choice often narrowgauge railway standard gauge narrowgauge railway none
disadvantagesedit
interchangeabilityedit
narrowgauge railways cannot interchange rolling stock freight passenger cars freely standard gauge broad gauge railways link transfers passengers freight require timeconsuming manual labour substantial capital expenditure bulk commodities coal gravel mechanically transshipped still incurs time penalties equipment required transfer often complex maintain
rail lines gauges coexist network times peak demand difficult move rolling stock needed break gauge exists enough rolling stock must available meet narrowgauge railways peak demand might much needed compared network gauge surplus equipment generates cash flow periods demand regions narrow gauge forms small part rail network like sakhalin railway soviet russia extra cost needed specifically design produce import narrowgauge equipment increases cost narrowgauge vehicle compared regular vehicles
growth potentialedit
another problem commonly faced narrowgauge railways lack physical space grow cheap construction meant engineered initial traffic demands standard broad gauge railway easily upgradedcitation needed handle heavier faster traffic many narrowgauge railways impractical improve speeds loads hauled could increase traffic density significantly limited case queensland australia queensland rail passenger network nearly reached capacity narrow gauge everincreasing population lines built thus negatingcitation needed original cost savings japan narrow gauge lines upgraded standard gauge minishinkansen allow service standard gauge highspeed vehicles alignment lines minimum curve radius lines maximum speed service still original narrowgauge rail line
narrowgauge line built higher standard like proposed super tokkyū concept japan problem reduced
solutions disadvantagesedit
interchangeabilityedit
solutions interchangeability problems transshipment bogie exchange cars rollbock system variable gauge dual gauge even gauge conversion european standard gauge trains normally buffers chain couplers allow tight curves main reason narrow gauge therefore narrowgauge trains normally couplers makes bogie exchange meaningless
alternatively rail network comprises narrowgauge network could also eliminate interchangeability problem
growth potentialedit
narrowgauge rails designed potential growth mind standard standard gauge rails obstacles faced future growth rail lines would similar rail gauges
lines constructed lower standard speed increased numerous methods including realigning rail lines increase minimum curve radius reducing number intersections introducing tilting trains improve speed trains running lines
