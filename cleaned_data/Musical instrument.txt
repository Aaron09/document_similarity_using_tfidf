definition basic operationedit
musical instrument makes sounds humans moved making sounds bodies—for example clapping—to using objects create music sounds musical instruments born1 primitive instruments probably designed emulate natural sounds purpose ritual rather entertainment2 concept melody artistic pursuit musical composition unknown early players musical instruments player sounding flute signal start hunt without thought modern notion making music2
musical instruments constructed broad array styles shapes using many different materials early musical instruments made found objects shells plant parts2 instruments evolved selection quality materials virtually every material nature used least culture make musical instruments2 plays musical instrument interacting way—for example plucking strings string instrument2
archaeologyedit
researchers discovered archaeological evidence musical instruments many parts world finds 67000 years however status musical instruments often dispute consensus solidifies artifacts dated back around 37000 years later artifacts made durable materials using durable methods tend survive specimens found cannot irrefutably placed earliest musical instruments3

historyedit
scholars agree completely reliable methods determining exact chronology musical instruments across cultures comparing organizing instruments based complexity misleading since advancements musical instruments sometimes reduced complexity example construction early slit drums involved felling hollowing large trees later slit drums made opening bamboo stalks much simpler task13
german musicologist curt sachs prominent musicologists14 musical ethnologists15 modern times argues misleading arrange development musical instruments workmanship since cultures advance different rates access different materials maintains example contemporary anthropologists comparing musical instruments cultures existed time differed organization culture handicraft cannot determine instruments primitive16 ordering instruments geography also totally reliable cannot always determined cultures contacted another shared knowledge
sachs proposed geographical chronology approximately 1400 preferable however limited subjectivity17 beyond 1400 follow overall development musical instruments time period17
science marking order musical instrument development relies archaeological artifacts artistic depictions literary references since data research path inconclusive three paths provide better historical picture3

classical romantic periods music lasting roughly 1750 1900 great deal musical instruments capable producing timbres higher volume developed introduced popular music design changes broadened quality timbres allowed instruments produce wider variety expression large orchestras rose popularity parallel composers determined produce entire orchestral scores made expressive abilities modern instruments since instruments involved collaborations much larger scale designs evolve accommodate demands orchestra102
instruments also become louder fill larger halls heard sizable orchestras flutes bowed instruments underwent many modifications design changes—most unsuccessful—in efforts increase volume instruments changed could play parts scores trumpets traditionally defective range—they incapable producing certain notes precision103 instruments clarinet saxophone tuba became fixtures orchestras instruments clarinet also grew entire families instruments capable different ranges small clarinets normal clarinets bass clarinets on102
