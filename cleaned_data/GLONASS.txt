glonass satellite


first satellitebased radio navigation system developed soviet union tsiklon purpose providing ballistic missile submarines method accurate positioning tsiklon satellites launched 1967 1978 main problem system although highly accurate stationary slowmoving ships required several hours observation receiving station position making unusable many navigation purposes guidance generation ballistic missiles65 1968–1969 navigation system would support navy also land space forces conceived formal requirements completed 1970 1976 government made decision launch development unified space navigation system glonass66
task designing glonass given group young specialists city krasnoyarsk26 today called zheleznogorsk leadership vladimir cheremisin developed different proposals institutes director grigory chernyavsky selected final work completed late 1970s system consists satellites operating altitude 20000 kilometres 12000 medium circular orbit would able promptly receiving stations position based signals four satellites also reveal objects speed direction satellites would launched three time heavylift proton rocket large number satellites needed program delegated manufacturing satellites polyot omsk better production capabilities6768
originally glonass designed accuracy metres reality accuracy metres civilian signal metres military signal6 first generation glonass satellites metres tall width metres measured across solar panels mass 1260 kilograms 2780
achieving full orbital constellationedit
early 1980s received first prototype satellites polyot ground tests many produced parts quality engineers perform substantial redesigning leading delay67 october 1982 three satellites designated kosmos1413 kosmos1414 kosmos1415 launched aboard proton rocket glonass satellite ready time launch instead expected three decided launch along mockups media reported event launch satellite secret objects long time could find nature objects telegraph agency soviet union tass covered launch describing glonass system created determine positioning civil aviation aircraft navy transport fishingboats soviet union67
1982 april 1991 soviet union successfully launched total glonassrelated satellites plus five test satellites soviet union disintegrated 1991 twelve glonass satellites planes operational enough allow limited system cover entire territory union satellites would necessary russian federation took control constellation continued development68 1993 system consisting satellites formally declared operational69 december 1995 brought fully operational constellation satellites brought precision glonass system achieved full operation year earlier68
economic crisisedit
since first generation satellites operated three years keep system full capacity launches year would necessary maintain full network satellites however financially difficult period 1989–1999 space programs funding russia consequently found unable afford launch rate full complement achieved december 1995 launches december 1999 result constellation reached lowest point operational satellites 2001 prelude demilitarisation responsibility program transferred ministry defence russias civilian space agency roscosmos6
renewed efforts modernizationedit




president vladimir putin glonass navigation device president putin paid special attention development glonass


2000s russian economy recovered state finances improved considerably vladimir putin took special interest glonass6 systems restoration made governments priorities7 purpose august 2001 federal targeted program global navigation system 2002–2011 government decision launched program given budget million70 aimed restoring full constellation 2009
december 2003 second generation satellite design glonassm launched first time slightly larger mass baseline glonass standing 1415 kilograms 3120 seven years lifetime four years longer lifetime original glonass satellite decreasing required replacement rate satellite also better accuracy ability broadcast extra civilian signals
2006 defence minister sergey ivanov ordered signals accuracy metres made available civilian users putin however satisfied demanded whole system made fully available everyone consequently 2007 restrictions lifted6971 accurate formerly militaryonly signal precision metres since freely available civilian users
middle first decade 21st century russian economy boomed resulting substantial increases countrys space budget 2007 financing glonass program increased considerably budget doubled 2006 glonass received million federal budget 2007 amount increased million69
1401 billion rubles billion spent program 2001–2011 making roscosmos largest project consuming third 2010 budget billion rubles72
period 2012 2020 billion rubles billion allocated support system73
restoring full capacityedit
june 2008 system consisted satellites fully operational time point roscosmos aimed full constellation satellites orbit 2010 year later previously planned74
september 2008 prime minister vladimir putin signed decree allocating additional billion rubles billion glonass federal budget75
promoting commercial useedit
although glonass constellation reached global coverage commercialisation especially development user segment lacking compared american example first commercial russianmade glonass navigation device cars glospace sgk70 introduced 2007 much bigger costlier similar receivers7 late 2010 handful glonass receivers market meant ordinary consumers improve situation russian government actively promoting glonass civilian use76
improve development user segment august 2010 sergei ivanov announced plan introduce import duty gpscapable devices including mobile phones unless compatible glonass government also planned force manufacturers russia support glonass starting 2011 would affect makers including foreign brands like ford toyota assembly facilities russia77
phone baseband chips major vendors qualcomm exynos broadcom78 support glonass combination
april 2011 swedens swepos—a national network satellite reference stations provides realtime positioning data meter accuracy—became first known foreign company glonass79
smartphones tablets also implementation glonass support 2011 devices released year xiaomi tech company xiaomi phone sony ericsson samsung galaxy note galaxy note galaxy galaxy siii mini google nexus late 2012 asus apple iphone ipad mini late 2012 adding support system allowing increased accuracy lock speed difficult conditions808182
finishing constellationedit
russias finishing constellation 2010 suffered setback december 2010 launch three glonassm satellites failed protonm rocket performed flawlessly upper stage blok version make maiden flight loaded much fuel sensor failure result upper stage three satellites crashed pacific ocean kommersant estimated launch failure cost million83 russian president dmitry medvedev ordered full audit entire program investigation failure84
following mishap roscosmos activated reserve satellites decided make first improved glonassk satellite launched february 2011 part operational constellation instead mainly testing originally planned would bring total number satellites obtaining almost complete worldwide coverage85 glonassk2 originally scheduled launched 2013 however 2012 expected launched 201586
2010 president dmitry medvedev ordered government prepare federal targeted program glonass covering years 2012–2020 original 2001 program scheduled 201183 june 2011 roscosmos revealed agency looking funding billion rubles 1435 billion program funds would spent maintaining satellite constellation developing maintaining navigational maps well sponsoring supplemental technologies make glonass attractive users87
october 2011 24th satellite system glonassm successfully launched plesetsk cosmodrome service88 made glonass constellation fully restored first time since 199689
november 2011 protonm booster successfully three glonassm units final orbit90
monday november 2011 soyuz rocket launched plesetsk cosmodrome space centre placed single glonassm satellite orbit plane
april 2013 single glonassm satellite delivered orbit soyuz rocket plesetsk cosmodrome restoring constellation operational satellites minimum provide global coverage91
july 2013 protonm rocket carrying glonassm satellites crashed takeoff baikonur cosmodrome veered course leaving plunged ground nose first rocket employed dm03 booster first time since december 2010 launch vehicle also failed resulting loss another satellites92
however 2014 system completed technical point view operational side still closed ministry defense formal status still development59
