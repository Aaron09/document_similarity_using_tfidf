1913 beginning international world initiative earths significant land areas scale million thousand sheets covering four degrees latitude degrees longitude excluding borders sheet high depending latitude wide although project eventually foundered left indexing system remains
1980s centralized printing standardized topographic maps began superseded databases coordinates could used computers moderately skilled users view print maps arbitrary contents coverage scale example federal government united states tiger initiative compiled interlinked databases federal state local political borders census enumeration areas roadways railroads water features support locating street addresses within street segments tiger developed 1980s used 1990 subsequent decennial censuses digital elevation models also compiled initially topographic maps stereographic interpretation aerial photographs satellite photography radar data since government projects funded taxes classified national security reasons datasets public domain freely usable without fees licensing
tiger datasets greatly facilitated geographic information systems made global positioning system much useful providing context around locations given technology coordinates initial applications mostly professionalized forms innovative surveying instruments agencylevel systems tended experts mid1990s increasingly userfriendly resources online mapping three dimensions integration mobile phones automotive navigation systems appeared 2011 future standardized centrally printed topographical maps left somewhat doubt1213
