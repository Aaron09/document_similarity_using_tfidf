large oilfilled paper plastic film capacitors contain polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs known waste pcbs leak groundwater landfills capacitors containing labelled containing askarel several trade names pcbfilled paper capacitors found pre1975 fluorescent lamp ballasts applications
capacitors catastrophically fail subjected voltages currents beyond rating reach normal life dielectric metal interconnection failures create arcing vaporizes dielectric fluid resulting case bulging rupture even explosion capacitors used sustained highcurrent applications overheat especially center capacitor rolls capacitors used within highenergy capacitor banks violently explode short capacitor causes sudden dumping energy stored rest bank failing unit high voltage vacuum capacitors generate soft xrays even normal operation proper containment fusing preventive maintenance help minimize hazards
highvoltage capacitors benefit precharge limit inrush currents powerup high voltage direct current hvdc circuits extends life component mitigate highvoltage hazards
