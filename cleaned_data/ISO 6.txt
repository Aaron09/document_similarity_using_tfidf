film speed measure photographic films sensitivity light determined sensitometry measured various numerical scales recent system closely related system used describe relationship exposure output image lightness digital cameras
relatively insensitive film correspondingly lower speed index requires exposure light produce image density sensitive film thus commonly termed slow film highly sensitive films correspondingly termed fast films digital film photography reduction exposure corresponding higher sensitivities generally leads reduced image quality coarser film grain higher image noise types short higher sensitivity grainier image ultimately sensitivity limited quantum efficiency film sensor

warnerkeedit
first known practical sensitometer allowed measurements speed photographic materials invented polish engineer leon warnerke1 pseudonym władysław małachowski 1837–1900 1880 among achievements awarded progress medal photographic society great britain 188223 commercialized since 1881
warnerke standard sensitometer consisted frame holding opaque screen array typically numbered gradually pigmented squares brought contact photographic plate timed test exposure phosphorescent tablet excited light burning magnesium ribbon3 speed emulsion expressed degrees warnerke sometimes seen warn corresponding last number visible exposed plate development fixation number represented increase speed typical plate speeds warnerke time
system success proved unreliable1 spectral sensitivity light fading intensity light emitted phosphorescent tablet excitation well high builttolerances3 concept however later built upon 1900 henry chapman jones 1855–1932 development plate tester modified speed system34

exposure indexedit
exposure index refers speed rating assigned particular film shooting situation variance films actual speed used compensate equipment calibration inaccuracies process variables achieve certain effects exposure index simply called speed setting compared speed rating
example photographer rate film push processing obtain printable negatives lowlight conditions film exposed
another example occurs cameras shutter miscalibrated consistently overexposes underexposes film similarly light meter inaccurate adjust rating accordingly order compensate defects consistently produce correctly exposed negativescitation needed
reciprocityedit
