version unix research unix ancestor modern unix systems


unix originally meant convenient platform programmers developing software systems rather nonprogrammer users89 system grew larger operating system started spreading academic circles users added tools system shared colleagues10
unix designed portable multitasking multiuser timesharing configuration unix systems characterized various concepts plain text storing data hierarchical file system treating devices certain types interprocess communication files large number software tools small programs strung together commandline interpreter using pipes opposed using single monolithic program includes functionality concepts collectively known unix philosophy brian kernighan pike summarize unix programming environment idea power system comes relationships among programs programs themselves11
early 1980s users began seeing unix potential universal operating system suitable computers sizes1213 unix environment client–server program model essential elements development internet reshaping computing centered networks rather individual computers
unix programming language developed distributed government academic institutions ported wider variety machine families operating system
unix operating system consists many utilities along master control program kernel kernel provides services start stop programs handles file system common lowlevel tasks programs share schedules access avoid conflicts programs access resource device simultaneously mediate access kernel special rights reflected division user space kernel space
microkernel concept introduced effort reverse trend towards larger kernels return system tasks completed smaller utilities standard computer consisted hard disk storage data terminal input output unix file model worked quite well linear however modern systems include networking devices graphical user interfaces developed file model proved inadequate task handling asynchronous events generated mouse 1980s nonblocking interprocess communication mechanisms augmented unix domain sockets shared memory message queues semaphores microkernel implementations functions network protocols could moved kernel conventional monolithic unix implementations network protocol stacks part kernel

unix system composed several components originally packaged together including development environment libraries documents portable modifiable source code components addition kernel operating system unix selfcontained software system reasons emerged important teaching learning tool broad influenceaccording
inclusion components make system large original unix distribution consisting copies compiled binaries plus source code documentation occupied less arrived single ninetrack magnetic tape printed documentation typeset online sources contained volumes
names filesystem locations unix components changed substantially across history system nonetheless implementation considered manywho canonical early structure

kernel source code usrsys composed several subcomponents

conf configuration machinedependent parts including boot code
device drivers control hardware pseudohardware
operating system kernel handling memory management process scheduling system calls
header files defining structures within system important systemspecific invariables


development environment early versions unix contained development environment sufficient recreate entire system source code

language compiler first appeared unix
machinelanguage assembler machine
linker combining object files
objectcode libraries installed usrlib libc system library runtime support primary library always additional libraries things mathematical functions libm database access unix introduced first version modern standard library stdio part system library later implementations increased number libraries significantly
make build manager introduced pwbunix effectively automating build process
include header files software development defining standard interfaces system invariants
languages unix contained fortran77 compiler programmable arbitraryprecision calculator scripting language later versions implementations contain many language compilers toolsets early releases included pascal tools many modern unix systems also include compiler collection well instead proprietary compiler system
tools including objectcode archive manager symboltable lister compilerdevelopment tools yacc debugging tools


commands unix makes little distinction commands userlevel programs system operation maintenance cron commands general utility grep generalpurpose applications text formatting typesetting package nonetheless major categories

shell programmable commandline interpreter primary user interface unix window systems appeared even afterward within command window
utilities core toolkit unix command including grep find many others subcategories include

system utilities administrative tools mkfs fsck many others
user utilities environment management tools passwd kill others


document formatting unix systems used outset document preparation typesetting systems included many related programs nroff troff refer modern unix systems also include packages ghostscript
graphics plot subsystem provided facilities producing simple vector plots deviceindependent format devicespecific interpreters display files modern unix systems also generally include standard windowing system many support opengl
communications early unix systems contained intersystem communication include interuser communication programs mail write introduced early intersystem communication system uucp systems beginning release included tcpip utilities

unix system significant impact operating systems achieved reputation interactivity providing software nominal educational running inexpensive hardware easy adapt move different machines unix originally written assembly language thought necessary system implementations early computers soon rewritten highlevel programming language24 although followed lead multics burroughs unix popularized idea
unix drastically simplified file model compared many contemporary operating systems treating kinds files simple byte arrays file system hierarchy contained machine services devices printers terminals disk drives providing uniform interface expense occasionally requiring additional mechanisms ioctl mode flags access features hardware simple stream bytes model plan operating system pushed model even eliminated need additional mechanisms
unix also popularized hierarchical file system arbitrarily nested subdirectories originally introduced multics common operating systems ways divide storage device multiple directories sections fixed number levels often level several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned multics decs rsx11ms group user hierarchy evolved directories cpms volumes evolved msdos subdirectories groupaccount hierarchy ibms os400 library systems folded broader posix file systems
making command interpreter ordinary userlevel program additional commands provided separate programs another multics innovation popularized unix unix shell used language interactive commands scripting shell scripts separate control language like ibms since shell commands another program user could choose even write shell commands could added without changing shell unixs innovative commandline syntax creating modular chains producerconsumer processes pipelines made powerful programming paradigm coroutines widely available many later commandline interpreters inspired unix shell
fundamental simplifying assumption unix focus newlinedelimited text nearly file formats binary editors original version unix entire system configured using textual shell command scripts common denominator system byte unlike recordbased file systems focus text representing nearly everything made unix pipes especially useful encouraged development simple general tools could easily combined perform complicated tasks focus text bytes made system scalable portable systems time textbased applications also proven popular application areas printing languages postscript application layer internet protocols smtp http soap
unix popularized syntax regular expressions found widespread unix programming interface became basis widely implemented operating system interface standard posix programming language soon spread beyond unix ubiquitous systems applications programming
early unix developers important bringing concepts modularity reusability software engineering practice spawning software tools movement time leading developers unix programs established cultural norms developing software norms became important influential technology unix termed unix philosophy
tcpip networking protocols quickly implemented unix versions widely used relatively inexpensive computers contributed internet explosion worldwide realtime connectivity formed basis implementations many platforms
unix policy extensive online documentation many years ready access system source code raised programmer expectations contributed 1983 launch free software movement
