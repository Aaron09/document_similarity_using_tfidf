player fretting hand change sounded note either fully muting plucking partially muting near bridge reduce volume make note fade faster fretting hand often mutes strings played stop sympathetic vibrations particularly player wants focused sound hand sympathetic resonance harmonically related strings sometimes desirable cases bassist fret harmonically related notes example fretting sustained third fret string underneath major chord played piano player bassist might hold note harmonics sound sympathetically
fretting hand vibrato plucked picked note either gentle narrow vibrato exaggerated wide vibrato bigger pitch variations fretted basses vibrato always alternation pitch note slightly higher pitch fretless basses player style vibrato alternate note slightly lower pitch done double bass unfretted stringed instruments vibrato mostly done stopped notes—that notes pressed fingerboard—open strings also vibratoed pressing string behind well fretting hand used bend plucked picked note pitch pushing pulling string note sounds higher pitch create opposite effect bend string pushed higher pitch plucked picked allowed fall lower regular pitch sounded though rare bassists tremolo barequipped bass produce effect
addition pressing note time bassists also press several notes time fretting hand perform double stop notes chord double stops chords used less often bassists electric guitarists playing rhythm guitar variety double stops chords performed electric bass double stops used bassists include octaves chords especially effective instruments higher ranges sixstring basses another variation fully pressing string gently graze string finger harmonic node points string creates chimelike upper partials also called overtones glissando effect fretting hand slides neck used create slide pitch subtle glissando performed moving fretting hand without plucking picking string pronounced effect string plucked picked first metal hardcore punk context pick scraped along sides lower strings
