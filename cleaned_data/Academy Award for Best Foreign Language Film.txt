although academy award best foreign language film commonly referred simply foreign film oscar newspaper articles internet7 designation misleading since films nationality matters much less language although film foreign nonamerican order nominated award also language english foreign films majority dialogue english cannot qualify foreign language film award academy usually applied requirement seriously disqualifying films containing much english dialogue recent case israeli film bands visit 20078 despite basic importance foreign language requirement completely dialogueless film 1983 nominated foreign language film category9
another disqualifying factor films television internet transmission prior theatrical release hence academys rejection dutch film bluebird 200410 film also refused submitting country exercised insufficient artistic control several films declared ineligible academy latter reason recent lust caution 2007 taiwans entry 80th academy awards11 disqualifications however generally take place prenomination stage exception place world 1992 uruguays entry 65th academy awards disqualified insufficient uruguayan artistic control secured nomination film declared ineligible removed final ballot nominated foreign language film award
since 2006 79th academy awards submitted films longer official language submitting country12 requirement previously prevented countries submitting films majority dialogue spoken language nonnative submitting country academys executive director explicitly cited reason rule change case italian film private 2004 disqualified simply main spoken languages arabic hebrew neither indigenous languages italy13 rule change enabled country like canada receive nomination hindilanguage film water previously canada nominated frenchlanguage films since films shot canadas official language english ineligible consideration foreign language film category rule change canada submitted films different languages—the inventedlanguage film bullet head 1991 inuktitut language film atanarjuat fast runner 2001 inuktitut countrys aboriginal languages official throughout canada still official nunavut northwest territories neither film earned nomination rule change however affect eligibility nonenglish speaking american films still disqualified foreign language film category nationality japaneselanguage film like letters jima 2006 mayanlanguage film like apocalypto 2006 unable compete academy award best foreign language film even though nominated case letters jima golden globe award best foreign language film similar nationality restrictions14 nationality restrictions also differ practice british academy film television arts bafta analogous award best film english language bafta award eligibility requires commercial release united kingdom body impose nationality restriction15

unlike academy award best picture officially goes winning films producers foreign language film award given specific individual considered award submitting country whole example oscar statuette canadian film barbarian invasions 2003 recently display museum civilization quebec city19 display tiff bell lightbox
rules currently governing foreign language film category state academy statuette oscar awarded picture accepted director behalf films creative talents emphasis added1 therefore director personally award simply accepts ceremony fact foreign language film award never associated specific individual since creation except 1956 29th academy awards names producers included nomination foreign language film category director like federico fellini thus considered never officially academy award merit lifetime even though four films received foreign language film award academy award fellini personally 1992 honorary award hand producers dino laurentiis carlo ponti considered personally 1956 foreign language film award given fellinis strada 1954 since names explicitly included nominationcitation needed
contrast bafta award best film english language personally awarded director producer—that awards rules specifically state nomination award presented director andor producer equally shared creative input director names submitted maximum individuals nominated film15
2014 announced name director engraved onto oscar statuette addition name country20
criticisms controversiesedit
country chooses official submission according rules decisions nominating bodies respective country sometimes mired controversy instance indian selection committee film federation india accused bias bhavna talwar director dharm 2007 claimed film rejected favor eklavya royal guard 2007 personal connections latter films director producer21
recent years academys definition term country polemical submissions 75th academy awards instance became shrouded controversy reported humbert balsan producer critically acclaimed palestinian film divine intervention 2002 tried submit picture academy told could foreign language film award since state palestine recognized academy rules academy previously accepted films political entities hong kong rejection divine intervention triggered accusations double standard propalestinian activists22 three years later however another palestinianarab film paradise 2005 succeeded getting nominated foreign language film award nomination also caused protests time proisraeli groups united states objected academys name palestine official website designate films submitting country23 intense lobbying jewish groups academy decided designate paradise submission palestinian authority move decried films director hany abuassad24 awards ceremony film eventually announced presenter smith submission palestinian territoriescitation needed
another object controversy academys onecountryonefilm rule criticized filmmakers25 guardian said idea best foreign language film category fundamentally flawed premise critically sneeredat oscar categories26 also stated perfect world least perfect world would still allow gaudy filmaward pageantry there’d need separate best foreign language film oscar fact years academy honour film predominantly english year’s best best picture says everything limitations nothing world cinema26
