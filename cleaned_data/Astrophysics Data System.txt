historyedit
many years growing problem astronomical research academic disciplines number papers published major astronomical journals increasing steadily meaning astronomers able read less less latest research findings 1980s astronomers nascent technologies formed basis internet could eventually used build electronic indexing system astronomical research papers would allow astronomers keep abreast much greater range research3
first suggestion database journal paper abstracts made conference astronomy large databases held garching münchen 1987 initial development electronic system accessing astrophysical abstracts took place following years 1991 discussions took place integrate simbad database containing available catalog designations objects outside solar system create system astronomers could search papers written given object1
initial version database consisting papers created proof concept 1988 database successfully connected simbad database summer 1993 creators believed first internet allow simultaneous querying transatlantic scientific databases 1994 service available proprietary network software transferred nascent world wide early year number users service quadrupled five weeks following introduction webbased service1
first journal articles available scanned bitmaps created paper journals 1995 onwards astrophysical journal began publish online edition soon followed main journals astronomy astrophysics monthly notices royal astronomical society provided links electronic editions first appearance since 1995 number users doubled roughly every years agreements almost astronomical journals supply abstracts scanned articles back early 19th century available service contains eight million documents service distributed worldwide twelve mirror sites twelve countries five continents database synchronized means weekly updates using rsync mirroring utility allows updates portions database changed updates triggered centrally initiate scripts mirror sites pull updated data main servers4

1284 papers m101 available long 1850


papers indexed within database bibliographic record containing details journal published various associated metadata author lists references citations originally data stored ascii format eventually limitations encouraged database maintainers migrate records extensible markup language format 2000 bibliographic records stored element subelements various metadata4
since advent online editions journals abstracts loaded publication date articles full journal text available subscribers older articles scanned abstract created using optical character recognition software scanned articles 1995 usually available free agreement journal publishers5
scanned articles stored tiff format medium high resolution tiff files converted demand files onscreen viewing postscript files printing generated files cached eliminate needlessly frequent regenerations popular articles 2000 contained scans consisted 1128955 article pages comprising 138789 articles 2005 grown expected grow 20075 information published
database initially contained astronomical references grown incorporate three databases covering astronomy including planetary sciences solar physics references physics including instrumentation geosciences references well preprints scientific papers arxiv astronomy database advanced accounts total usage articles assigned different databases according subject rather journal published articles journal might appear three subject databases separation databases allows searching discipline tailored words automatically given different weight functions different database searches depending common relevant field4

software hardwareedit
software runs system written specifically allowing extensive customization astronomical needs would possible general purpose database software scripts designed platform independent possible given need facilitate mirroring different systems around world although growing linux operating system choice within astronomy increasing optimization scripts installation platform4

indexingedit
currently receives abstracts tables contents almost hundred journal sources service receive data referring article multiple sources creates bibliographic reference based accurate data source common latex almost scientific journals greatly facilitates incorporation bibliographic data system standardized format importing htmlcoded webbased articles also simple utilizes perl scripts importing processing standardizing bibliographic data4
apparently mundane task converting author names standard surname initial format actually difficult automate wide variety naming conventions around world possibility given name davis could first name middle name surname accurate conversion names requires detailed knowledge names authors active astronomy maintains extensive database author names also used searching database
electronic articles list references given article easily extracted scanned articles reference extraction relies reference database inverted list citations paper database citation lists used past identify popular articles missing database mostly 1975 added system
coverageedit
database contains eight million articles cases major journals astronomy astrophysical journal astronomical journal astronomy astrophysics publications astronomical society pacific monthly notices royal astronomical society coverage complete issues indexed number present journals account twothirds papers database rest consisting papers published journals around world well conference proceedings5
database contains complete contents major journals many minor ones well coverage references citations much less complete references citations articles major journals fairly complete references private communication press preparation cannot matched author errors reference listings also introduce potential errors astronomical papers cite cited articles journals fall outside scope chemistry mathematics biology journals8
search engineedit




example complex search combining object title abstract queries date filter


since inception developed highly complex search engine query abstract object databases search engine tailormade searching astronomical abstracts engine user interface assume user wellversed astronomy able interpret search results designed return relevant papers database queried author names astronomical object names title words words abstract text results filtered according number criteria works first gathering synonyms simplifying search terms described generating inverted file list documents matching search term userselected logic filters applied inverted list generate final search results9

impact astronomyedit
almost universally used research tool among astronomers several studies estimated quantitatively much efficient made astronomy estimated increased efficiency astronomical research fulltime equivalent research years year1 another found 2002 effect equivalent fulltime researchers astronomical research done france2 allowed literature searches would previously taken days weeks carry completed seconds estimated increased readership astronomical literature factor three since inception2
monetary terms increase efficiency represents considerable amount 12000 active astronomical researchers worldwide equivalent working population astronomers global astronomical research budget estimated 4000 5000 million usd12 value astronomy would 200–250 million annually operating budget small fraction amount2
great importance astronomers recognized united nations general assembly commended work success particularly noting importance astronomers developing world reports united nations committee peaceful uses outer space 2002 report visiting committee center astrophysics meanwhile said service revolutionized astronomical literature probably valuable single contribution astronomy research made lifetime13
sociological studies using adsedit
used almost universally astronomers reveal much astronomical research distributed around world users access system institutes higher education whose address easily used determine users geographical location studies reveal highest percapita users france netherlandsbased astronomers developed countries measured capita system less developed countries relationship capita linear range usage capita exceeds range gdps capita basic research carried country measured usage found proportional square countrys divided population2
usage statistics also suggest astronomers developed countries tend productive less developed countries amount basic research carried proportional number astronomers country multiplied capita statistics also imply astronomers european cultures carry three times much research asian cultures perhaps suggesting cultural differences importance attached astronomical research2
also used show fraction singleauthor astronomy papers decreased substantially since 1975 astronomical papers authors become common since 199014
