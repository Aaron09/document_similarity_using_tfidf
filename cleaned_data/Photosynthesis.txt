photorespiration


carbon dioxide concentrations rise rate sugars made lightindependent reactions increases limited factors rubisco enzyme captures carbon dioxide lightindependent reactions binding affinity carbon dioxide oxygen concentration carbon dioxide high rubisco carbon dioxide however carbon dioxide concentration rubisco bind oxygen instead carbon dioxide process called photorespiration uses energy produce sugars
rubisco oxygenase activity disadvantageous plants several reasons

product oxygenase activity phosphoglycolate carbon instead 3phosphoglycerate carbon phosphoglycolate cannot metabolized calvinbenson cycle represents carbon lost cycle high oxygenase activity therefore drains sugars required recycle ribulose 5bisphosphate continuation calvinbenson cycle
phosphoglycolate quickly metabolized glycolate toxic plant high concentration inhibits photosynthesis
salvaging glycolate energetically expensive process uses glycolate pathway carbon returned calvinbenson cycle 3phosphoglycerate reactions also produce ammonia able diffuse plant leading loss nitrogen
