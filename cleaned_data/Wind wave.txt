great majority large breakers seen beach result distant winds five factors influence formation flow structures wind waves4

wind speed strength relative wave speed—the wind must moving faster wave crest energy transfer
uninterrupted distance open water wind blows without significant change direction called fetch
width area affected fetchclarification needed
wind duration time wind blown water
water depth

factors work together determine size wind waves structure flow within
main dimensions associated waves

wave height vertical distance trough crest
wave length distance crest crest direction propagation
wave period time interval arrival consecutive crests stationary point
wave propagation direction

fully developed maximum wave size theoretically possible wind specific strength duration fetch exposure specific wind could cause dissipation energy breaking wave tops formation whitecaps waves given area typically range heights weather reporting scientific analysis wind wave statistics characteristic height period time usually expressed significant wave height figure represents average height highest onethird waves given time period usually chosen somewhere range minutes twelve hours specific wave storm system significant wave height also value trained observer ships crew would estimate visual observation state given variability wave height largest individual waves likely somewhat less twice reported significant wave height particular storm5
wave formation initially flat water surface wind started random distribution normal pressure turbulent wind flow water pressure fluctuation produces normal tangential stresses surface water generates waves assumed that6

water originally rest
water viscous
water irrotational
random distribution normal pressure water surface turbulent wind
correlations water motions neglected

second mechanism involves wind shear forces water surface john miles suggested surface wave generation mechanism initiated turbulent wind shear flows based inviscid orrsommerfeld equation 1957 found energy transfer wind water surface proportional curvature velocity profile wind point mean wind speed equal wave speed since wind speed profile logarithmic water surface curvature negative sign point relation shows wind flow transferring kinetic energy water surface interface
assumptions

twodimensional parallel shear flow
incompressible inviscid water wind
irrotational water
slope displacement water surface small7

generally wave formation mechanisms occur together water surface eventually produce fully developed waves
example8 assume flat surface beaufort state sudden wind flow blows steadily across surface physical wave generation process follows sequence

turbulent wind forms random pressure fluctuations surface ripples wavelengths order centimetres generated pressure fluctuations phillips mechanism6
winds keep acting initially rippled surface causing waves become larger waves grow pressure differences larger causing growth rate increase finally shear instability expedites wave growth exponentially miles mechanism6
interactions waves surface generate longer waves9 interaction transfer wave energy shorter waves generated miles mechanism waves slightly lower frequencies frequency peak wave magnitudes finally waves faster cross wind speed pierson moskowitz10

wave shoaling refractionedit
also wave shoaling refraction
waves travel deep shallow water shape alters wave height increases speed decreases length decreases wave orbits become asymmetrical process called shoaling
wave refraction process wave crests realign result decreasing water depths varying depths along wave crest cause crest travel different phase speeds parts wave deeper water moving faster shallow water process continues crests become nearly parallel depth contours rays—lines normal wave crests fixed amount energy flux contained—converge local shallows shoals therefore wave energy rays concentrated converge resulting increase wave height
effects related spatial variation phase speed phase speed also changes ambient current doppler shift effects refraction altering wave height also occur current variations case meeting adverse current wave steepens wave height increases wave length decreases similar shoaling water depth decreases15
wave breakingedit




wave breaking


also surf wave breaking wave iribarren number
waves undergo phenomenon called breaking16 breaking wave whose base longer support causing collapse wave breaks runs shallow water wave systems oppose combine forces slope steepness ratio wave great breaking inevitable
individual waves deep water break wave steepness—the ratio wave height wavelength λ—exceeds shallow water water depth small compared wavelength individual waves break wave height larger times water depth waves also break wind grows strong enough blow crest base wave
shallow water base wave decelerated drag seabed result upper parts propagate higher velocity base leading face crest become steeper trailing face flatter exaggerated extent leading face forms barrel profile crest falling forward extends ahead wave
three main types breaking waves identified surfers surf lifesavers varying characteristics make less suitable surfing present different dangers

spilling rolling safest waves surf found areas relatively flat shorelines common type shorebreak deceleration wave base gradual velocity upper parts differ much height breaking occurs mainly steepness ratio exceeds stability limit
plunging dumping break suddenly dump swimmers—pushing bottom great force preferred waves experienced surfers strong offshore winds long wave periods cause dumpers often found sudden rise floor reef sandbar deceleration wave base sufficient cause upward acceleration significant forward velocity excess upper part crest peak rises overtakes forward face forming barrel tube collapses
surging never actually break approach waters edge water deep tend form steep shorelines waves knock swimmers drag back deeper water

shoreline near vertical waves break reflected energy retained wave returns seaward interference patterns caused superposition incident reflected waves superposition cause localised instability peaks cross peaks break instability also clapotic waves
