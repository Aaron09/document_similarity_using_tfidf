personalized conducted researchers daytoday facetoface contact people studying thus participants observers lives study
multifactorial conducted data collection techniques qualitative quantitative nature order conclusion
requires longterm commitment conducted researcher intends interact people studying extended period time exact time frame vary several weeks year
inductive conducted accumulation descriptive detail build toward general patterns explanatory theories rather structured test hypotheses derived existing theories models

ethnography method dedicated entirely field work aimed gaining deeper insight certain peoples knowledge social culture
ethnographys advantages

open certain experiences group research research methods fail cover
notions taken granted highlighted confronted
intuitive deep human understanding interpretations ethnographer accounts informants studied goes beyond quantitative research terms extracting meanings
ethnography allows people outside culture whether primitive tribe corporations employees learn members practices motives understandings values

however certain challenges limitations ethnographic method

deep expertise required ethnographers must accumulate knowledge methods domains interest take considerable training time
sensitivity ethnographer outsider must exercise discretion caution avoid offending alienating harming observed
access negotiating access field sites participants timeconsuming difficult secretive guarded organizations require different approaches order researchers succeed45
duration cost research involve prolonged time field particularly building trust participants usually necessary obtaining rich data
bias ethnographers bring experience bear pursuing questions reviewing data lead biases directions inquiry analysis
descriptive approach ethnography relies heavily storytelling presentation critical incidents inevitably selective viewed weakness used scientific approaches hypothesis testing quantification replication

gary alan fine argues nature ethnographic inquiry demands researchers deviate formal idealistic rules ethics come widely accepted qualitative quantitative approaches research many ethical assumptions rooted positivist postpositivist epistemologies adapted time apparent must accounted research paradigms ethical dilemmas evident throughout entire process conducting ethnographies including design implementation reporting ethnographic study essentially fine maintains researchers typically ethical claim assume includes ways things would inappropriate others know46
fine necessarily casting blame ethnographic researchers tries show researchers often make idealized ethical claims standards inherently based partial truths selfdeceptions fine also acknowledges many partial truths selfdeceptions unavoidable maintains illusions essential maintain occupational reputation avoid potentially caustic consequences claims ethnographers cannot help lying reveal truths escape bold47 based assertions fine establishes three conceptual clusters ethnographic ethical dilemmas situated classic virtues technical skills ethnographic self

classic virtuesedit

kindly ethnographer ethnographers present sympathetic aids research process also deceptive identity present subjects different circumstances
friendly ethnographer ethnographers operate assumption dislike anyone ethnographers find intensely dislike individuals encountered research crop findings56
honest ethnographer research participants know research goals responses likely skewed therefore ethnographers often conceal know order increase likelihood acceptance participants56

technical skillsedit

precise ethnographer ethnographers often create illusion field notes data reflect really happened engage opposite plagiarism giving undeserved credit loose interpretations paraphrasing researchers take nearfictions turn claims fact closest ethnographers ever really reality approximate truth
observant ethnographer readers ethnography often assume report scene complete little importance missed reality ethnographer always miss aspect lacking omniscience everything open multiple interpretations misunderstandings ethnographers skills observation collection data vary individual depicted ethnography never whole picture
unobtrusive ethnographer participant scene researcher always effect communication occurs within research site degree active member affects extent sympathetic understanding possible57

ethnographic selfedit
following commonly misconceived conceptions ethnographers

candid ethnographer researcher personally situates within ethnography ethically problematic illusion everything reported observed researcher
chaste ethnographer ethnographers participate within field invariably develop relationships research subjectsparticipants relationships sometimes accounted within reporting ethnography although influence research findings
fair ethnographer fine claims objectivity illusion everything ethnography known perspective therefore unethical researcher report fairness findings
literary ethnographer representation balancing determining show poeticprosaic language style versus tell straightforward factual reporting individual skills ethnographer influence appears value research58

according norman denzin ethnographers consider following eight principles observing recording sampling data

groups combine symbolic meanings patterns interaction
observe world point view subject maintaining distinction everyday scientific perceptions reality
link groups symbols meanings social relationships
record behavior
methodology highlight phases process change stability
type symbolic interactionism
concepts would avoid casual explanations
