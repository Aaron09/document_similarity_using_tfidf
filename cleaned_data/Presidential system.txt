supporters generally claim four basic advantages presidential systems

direct elections presidential system president often elected directly people makes presidents power legitimate leader appointed indirectly however necessary feature presidential system presidential states indirectly elected head state
separation powers presidential system establishes presidency legislature parallel structures allows structure monitor check preventing abuses power
speed decisiveness president strong powers usually enact changes quickly however separation powers also slow system
stability president virtue fixed term provide stability prime minister dismissed time

direct electionsedit
presidential systems president elected popular vote although united states electoral college directly elected method1 method president receives personal mandate lead country whereas parliamentary system candidate might receive personal mandate represent constituency means president elected independently legislative branch
separation powersedit
presidential systems separation executive legislature sometimes held advantage branch scrutinize actions parliamentary system executive drawn legislature making criticism considerably less likely formal condemnation executive legislature often considered vote confidence according supporters presidential system lack checks balances means misconduct prime minister never discovered writing watergate woodrow wyatt former said dont think watergate couldnt happen wouldnt hear ibid
critics respond presidential systems legislature controlled presidents party situation exists proponentswho note even situation legislator presidents party better position criticize president policies deem necessary since immediate security presidents position less dependent legislative support parliamentary systems party discipline much strictly enforced parliamentary backbencher publicly criticizes executive policies significant extent heshe faces much higher prospect losing hisher partys nomination even outright expulsion party even mild criticism backbencher could carry consequences serious enough particular removal consideration cabinet post effectively muzzle legislator serious political ambitions
despite existence confidence vote practice extremely difficult stop prime minister cabinet made decision parliamentary system important legislation proposed incumbent prime minister cabinet voted majority members parliament considered vote confidence emphasize particular point prime minister often declare particular legislative vote matter confidence first sign reluctance part legislators party government loses parliamentary vote confidence incumbent government must either resign call elections held consequence backbenchers willing endure hence confidence vote parliamentary countries like britain occurs times century 1931 david lloyd george told select committee parliament really control executive pure fiction schlesinger 1982
contrast presidential legislative initiative fails pass legislature controlled presidents party clinton health care plan 1993 united states damage presidents political standing party generally immediate effect whether president completes term
speed decisivenessedit
supporters presidential systems claimwho presidential systems respond rapidly emerging situations parliamentary ones prime minister taking action needs retain support legislature president often less constrained england slept future president john kennedy argued british prime ministers stanley baldwin neville chamberlain constrained need maintain confidence commons
supporters presidential systems sometimes argue exact opposite direction however saying presidential systems slow decisionmaking beneficial ends divided government presidency legislature controlled different parties said restrain excesses parties guarantee bipartisan input legislation united states republican congressman bill frenzel wrote 1995

think gridlock best thing since indoor plumbing gridlock natural gift framers constitution gave country would subjected policy swings resulting whimsy public competition—whether multibranch multilevel multihouse—is important checks balances ongoing kind centrist government thank heaven government nationalizes year privatizes next year infinitum checks balances

stabilityedit
although parliamentary governments long periods time without confidence vote italy israel french fourth republic experienced difficulties maintaining stability parliamentary systems multiple parties governments forced rely coalitions often nations system proportional representation extremist parties theoretically threat leaving coalition agendas
many people consider presidential systems able survive emergencies country enormous stress supporters argue better president fixed term rotating premierships france algerian controversy switched semipresidential system lanka civil israel experimented directly elected prime minister 1992 france lanka results widely considered positive however case israel unprecedented proliferation smaller parties occurred leading restoration previous system selecting prime minister
fact elections fixed presidential system considered supporters welcome check powers executive contrasting parliamentary systems allow prime minister call elections whenever orchestrate vote confidence trigger election cannot legislative item passed presidential model said discourage sort opportunism instead forces executive operate within confines term cannot alter suit needs
proponents presidential system also argue stability extends cabinets chosen system compared parliamentary system cabinets must drawn within legislative branch presidential system cabinet members selected much larger pool potential candidates allows presidents ability select cabinet members based much ability competency lead particular department loyalty president opposed parliamentary cabinets might filled legislators chosen better reason perceived loyalty prime minister supporters presidential system note parliamentary systems pronecitation needed disruptive cabinet shuffles legislators moved portfolios whereas presidential system cabinets united states cabinet cabinet shuffles unusual

critics generally claim three basic disadvantages presidential systems

tendency towards authoritarianism political scientists presidentialism raises stakes elections exacerbates polarization lead authoritarianism linz
political gridlock separation powers presidential system establishes presidency legislature parallel structures critics argue create undesirable longterm political gridlock whenever president legislative majority different parties common electorate usually expects rapid results policies possible linz mainwaring shugart addition reduces accountability allowing president legislature shift blame
impediments leadership change presidential systems often make difficult remove president office early example taking actions become unpopular

tendency towards authoritarianismedit
prime minister without majority support legislature must either form coalition able lead minority government govern manner acceptable least opposition parties even majority government prime minister must still govern within perhaps unwritten constraints determined members party—a premier situation often greater risk losing party leadership party risk losing next election hand winning presidency winnertakeall zerosum game elected president might able marginalize influence parties exclude rival factions party well even leave party whose ticket elected president thus rule without party support next election abuse power multiple terms worrisome situation many interest groups yale political scientist juan linz argues



danger zerosum presidential elections pose compounded rigidity presidents fixed term office winners losers sharply defined entire period presidential mandate losers must wait four five years without access executive power patronage zerosum game presidential regimes raises stakes presidential elections inevitably exacerbates attendant tension polarization



constitutions require plurality support saidby especially undesirable significant power vested person enjoy support majority population
political scientists presidential systems constitutionally stable difficulty sustaining democratic practices noting presidentialism slipped authoritarianism many countries implemented according political scientist fred riggs presidentialism fallen authoritarianism nearly every country attempted23 political sociologist seymour martin lipset pointed taken place political cultures conducive democracy militaries tended play prominent role countries hand oftencitedby list worlds older democracies includes countries costa rica united states presidential systems
presidential system legislature president equal mandates public conflicts branches government might reconciled president legislature disagree government working effectively strong incentive extraconstitutional measures break deadlock three common branches government executive best position extraconstitutional measures especially president head state head government commanderinchief military contrast parliamentary system oftenceremonial head state either constitutional monarch case parliamentary republic experienced respected figure given political emergency good chance even ceremonial head state able emergency reserve powers restrain head government acting emergency extraconstitutional manner possible head state head government personcitation needed

political gridlockedit
political scientists speak failure presidentialism separation powers presidential system often creates undesirable longterm political gridlock instability whenever president legislative majority different parties common electorate often expects rapid results possible policies switches different party next election critics including juan linz argue inherent political instability cause democracies fail seen cases brazil chilecitation needed
lack accountabilityedit
cases gridlock presidential systems said criticswho offer voters kind accountability seen parliamentary systems easy either president legislature escape blame shifting describing united states former treasury secretary douglas dillon said president blames congress congress blames president public remains confused disgusted government washington6

another alleged problem presidentialism often difficult remove president office early even president proved inefficient even becomes unpopular even policy unacceptable majority countrymen methods must endured moment comes election7 john tyler elected vice president assumed presidency william henry harrison died thirty days office tyler blocked whig agenda loathed nominal party remained firmly control executive branch presidential systems provide legal means remove president simply unpopular even behaving manner might considered unethical immoral provided illegal citedcitation needed reason many presidential countries experienced military coups remove leader said lost mandate
parliamentary systems quickly remove unpopular leaders vote confidence procedure serves pressure release valve political tension votes confidence easier achieve minority government situations even unpopular leader heads majority government often less secure position president usually parliamentary systems basic premise premiers popularity sustains serious enough blow premier matter consequence offer resign prior next election members parliament would persist supporting premier serious risk losing seats therefore especially parliaments strong party system prominent members premiers party strong incentive initiate leadership challenge hopes mitigating damage party often premier facing serious challenge resolves save face resigning formally removed—margaret thatchers relinquishing premiership prominent example
hand removing president impeachment allowed constitutions impeachment proceedings often initiated cases president violated constitution broken impeachment often made difficult comparison removal party leader normally governed often less formal rules party nearly parties including governing parties relatively simple process removing leaders
furthermore even impeachment proceedings sitting president successful whether causing removal office compelling resignation legislature usually little discretion determining ousted presidents successor since presidential systems usually adhere rigid succession process enforced regardless vacancy presidency comes usual outcome presidency becoming vacant vice president automatically succeeds presidency vice presidents usually chosen president whether running mate elected alongside president appointed sitting president vice president succeeds presidency probable continue many policies former president prominent example accession would elevation vice president gerald ford presidency richard nixon agreed resign face virtually certain impeachment removal succession took place notwithstanding fact ford assumed vice presidency appointed nixon replace spiro agnew also resigned scandal cases particularly wouldbe successor presidency seen legislators better even worse president wish removed strong incentive abstain pursuing impeachment proceedings even legal grounds
since prime ministers parliamentary systems must always retain confidence legislature cases prime minister suddenly leaves office little point anyone without reasonable prospect gaining legislative confidence attempting assume premiership ensures whenever premiership becomes vacant become vacant legislators premiers party always play role determining leaders permanent successor theory could interpreted support argument parliamentary party ought power elect party leader directly indeed least historically parliamentary system parties leadership electoral procedures usually called partys legislative caucus fill leadership vacancy electing leader directly amongst whole succession process completed within short time frame practical today however system commonly practiced parliamentary system parties rules provide leadership election general membership party permitted vote point process either directly leader delegates elect leader convention though many cases partys legislators allowed exercise disproportionate influence final vote whenever leadership election becomes necessary account vacancy arising suddenly interim leader often informally called interim prime minister cases involves governing party selected parliamentary party usually stipulation expectation interim leader candidate permanent leadership parties british conservative party employ combination aforementioned electoral processes select leader event prime minister forced leave office scandal similar circumstance usually little ability influence party final selection leader anyone seen close ties prime minister limited serious prospect elected leader even cases outgoing prime minister leaving office voluntarily often frowned outgoing former premier engage overt attempt influence election example endorsing candidate leadership election part party process selecting leader usually strong incentive foster competitive leadership election order stimulate interest participation election turn encourages sale party memberships support party general
walter bagehot criticized presidentialism allow transfer power event emergency



cabinet constitution sudden emergency people choose ruler occasion quite possible even likely would ruler occasion great qualities imperious rapid energy eager nature great crisis required—are impediments—in common times lord liverpool better everyday politics chatham—a louis philippe better napoleon structure world want sudden occurrence grave tempest change helmsman—to replace pilot calm pilot storm
presidential government nothing kind american government calls government supreme people quick crisis time sovereign power needed cannot find supreme people congress elected fixed period going perhaps fixed installments cannot accelerated retarded—you president chosen fixed period immovable period elastic element bespoken government advance whether want must keep




opponentswho presidential system note years later bagehots observation came life world neville chamberlain replaced winston churchill
however supporters presidential system question validity point argue presidents able command considerable level security tenures direct mandates would worthless counter republics united states successfully endured crises without need change heads state supporters argue presidents elected time peace prosperity proven perfectly capable responding effectively serious crisis largely ability make necessary appointments cabinet elsewhere government creating positions deal challenges prominent recent example would appointment secretary homeland security following september attacks united states
supporters presidential system counter impediments leadership change little unavoidable consequence direct mandate afforded president thus strength instead weakness times crisis times prime minister might hesitate need keep parliaments support whereas president without fear removal office might disapprove actions furthermore even prime minister manage successfully resolve crisis multiple crises guarantee possess political capital needed remain office similar future crisis unlike would possible presidential system perceived crisis parliamentary system might give disgruntled backbenchers rivals opportunity launch vexing challenge prime ministers leadership noted situations prime minister often resigns even moderately doubt ability endure challenge guarantee sudden accession unproven prime minister crisis change better—the ouster thatcher successfully prosecuting falklands nevertheless compelled resign midst persian gulf crisis seen example argue successor john major proved less able defend british interests ensuing gulf
finally manywho criticized presidential systems alleged slowness respond citizens needs often checks balances make action difficult walter bagehot said american system executive crippled getting needs legislature spoiled without responsibility executive becomes unfit name since cannot execute decides legislature demoralized liberty taking decisions others suffer effects8
defenders presidential systems argue parliamentary system operating jurisdiction strong ethnic sectarian tensions tend ignore interests minorities even treat contempt first half century government northern ireland often cited example whereas presidential systems ensure minority wishes rights cannot disregarded thus preventing tyranny majority vice versa protect wishes rights majority abuse legislature executive holds contrary viewpoint especially frequent scheduled electionscitation needed hand supporters parliamentary systems contend strength independence judiciary decisive factor comes protection minority rights
britishirish philosopher edmund burke stated official elected based unbiased opinion mature judgment enlightened conscience therefore reflect arguments certain policies taking positions official would believe best long ones constituents country whole even means shortterm backlash thus defenders presidential systems hold sometimes wisest always popular decision vice versa
