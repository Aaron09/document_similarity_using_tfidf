flat tire occurs tire deflates occur result normal wearandtear leak serious damage tire lost sufficient pressure impair stability vehicle damage tire driven condition tire changed andor repaired becomes completely flat continuing drive vehicle flat tire damage tire beyond repair possibly damage vehicle occupants vehicles danger flat tire lowpressure tire considered emergency situation requiring immediate attention tires known runflat tires either extremely stiff sidewalls resilient filler allow driving limited distance flat usually reduced speed without permanent damage hazard
modern radial tire visibly distorted even dangerously inflation pressure especially true tires aspect ratio sometimes known profile tires thus maintenance adequate tire pressure important safety implications despite fact owners neglect tire designers tried make tires failsafe failure operator maintain tire pressure wont cause major safety concern limitations
bubbleedit




tire bubble


tire bubbles also referred bulges bumps protrusions carbuncles occur sidewall tire failed resulting protrusion causes bubbles include impact high speed overinflation poor tire constructionmanufacturing generally recommended replace tire since probability tire failure increased occur inner outer sidewall sometimes seen easily looking symmetry tire lettering sidewall tire
hydroplaning aquaplaningedit
main article hydroplaning road vehicle
hydroplaning also known aquaplaning condition layer water builds tire road surface hydroplaning occurs tread pattern cannot channel away enough water adequate rate ensure semidry footprint area hydroplaning prevalent wider tires higher speeds hydroplaning occurs tire effectively floats road surface cushion water loses traction braking steering creating unsafe driving condition hydroplaning occurs considerably less responsiveness steering wheel correction unsafe condition gradually reduce speed merely lifting acceleratorgas pedal
dangers aged tiresedit
research tests show tires begin become potentially dangerous even unused aged tires appear similar properties newly manufactured tires rubber degrades time vehicle traveling high speeds freeway tread could peel leading severe loss control tropical climates tires degrade sooner temperate climates care taken climates ensure tires failcitation needed also tires seldomused trailers greatest risk agefailure tires built withstand idleness usually nylon reinforcement




tire showing weathercracking longterm exposure weather


many automakers recommend replacing tires years several tire manufacturers bridgestone michelin called tires removed service years date manufacture however investigative report brian ross abcs 2020 news magazine found many major retailers goodyear walmart sears selling tires produced years currently aged tires exists united states8485
scrap tires environmental issuesedit




child plays playground made recycled tires guelph ontario


tires discarded considered scrap tires scrap tires often reused things bumper barriers weights hold tarps facilities permitted recycle scrap tires chipping processing products selling material licensed power plants fuel tires also retreaded reuse group study evaluate possibility using scrap tires crash cushion system objective study evaluate material properties used tires recycled tirederived materials lowcost reusable crash cushions86
interesting developed years back universally used process scrap tires material roads process removing metal granulating rubber chemical process mixed usual materials macadamised roads resulting roads proved better waterproofing resilent resulting smoother ride also longer tire life several countries example south korea regulations requiring
americans generate million scrap tires year87 many states regulations number scrap tires held site concerns dumping fire hazards mosquitoes past millions tires discarded open fields creates breeding ground mosquitoes since tires often hold water inside remain warm enough mosquito breeding mosquitoes create nuisance increase likelihood spreading disease also creates fire danger since large tire pile fuel tire fires burned months since water adequately penetrate cool burning tires tires known liquefy releasing hydrocarbons contaminants ground even ground water extreme heat temperatures fire black smoke tire fire causes pollution hazard wind properties
scrap tire chips landscaping become controversial leaching metals contaminants tire pieces zinc concentrated weight levels high enough highly toxic aquatic life plants88 particular concern evidence compounds leach tires water contain hormone disruptors cause liver lesions89
asymmetric tireedit
asymmetric tire kind specific stabilization method used cars
tire treadedit
asymmetric tire refer tire whose tread pattern form line symmetry point symmetry visàvis central line thus distinct inside outside edge mounted either side vehicle since tread pattern many ordinary tires form symmetry relation design pattern noise method mounting tires specially prescribed type tires used many cases promote tire performance braking performance turning performance since tread contact changes according change alignment travel
tires also directional tread pattern favors operation direction usually takes form vshaped grooves help disperse water center edge tread symmetric directional tires used sides mounted cannot moved side since tread pattern wrong direction restricts tire rotation directional tires also asymmetric case specific left righthanded versions
stabilizing beltsedit
asymmetric tire refer passenger radial tire asymmetric structure stabilizing belts built generally stabilizing belts give selfaligning torque motor vehicle running straight ahead well cornering however sidewalls radial tire flexible delay lateral reaction tread tire wheel vehicle steered positively lateral force transmitted front wheel rear vehicle tend steered course whereas asymmetric belts bring gradual change lateral displacement tire tread corresponding cornering load grows progressive change harden sidewalls produce immediate response steering results safer driving
usesedit
tires desired landfills large volumes void space quickly consumes valuable space90 people found uses tires
rubber tires likely contain traces heavy metals serious pollutants tightly bonded within actual rubber compound unlikely hazardous unless tire structure seriously damaged fire strong chemicalscitation needed
building elementsedit
tires filled earth used garden containers91 house foundations92 bulletproof walls93 prevent soil erosion flood plains94
tire swingedit




three boys tire swing


tires sometimes converted swing play innovative allows easy find purpose existing tire suitable road use95
exercise equipmentedit
used tires employed exercise equipment athletic programs american football96 classic conditioning drill hones players speed agility tire tires laid side side tire left inches ahead tire right zigzag pattern athletes tire pattern stepping center tire drill forces athletes lift feet ground higher normal avoid tripping97
recyclingedit
main article tire recycling
tires recycled among things melt asphalt typically crumb rubber modifier—recycled asphalt pavement crm—rap9899 aggregate portland cement concrete tires also recycled tires retreadeding101 tires also used garden beds rubber mulch hold water prevent weeds growingdubious discuss green buildings made private public buildings made tirescitation needed
