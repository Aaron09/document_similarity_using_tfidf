origins hydrography making charts navigation individual mariners navigated waters usually private property even closely held secrets individuals used commercial military advantage transoceanic trade exploration increased hydrographic surveys started carried exercise right commissioning surveys increasingly done governments special hydrographic offices national organizations particularly navies realized collection systematization distribution knowledge gave great organizational military advantages thus born dedicated national hydrographic organizations collection organization publication distribution hydrography incorporated charts sailing directions

prior establishment united kingdom hydrographic office royal navy captains responsible provision charts practice meant ships often sailed inadequate information safe navigation areas surveyed data rarely reached needed admiralty appointed alexander dalrymple hydrographer 1795 remit gather distribute charts ships within year existing charts previous centuries collated first catalogue published2 first chart produced direction admiralty chart quiberon brittany appeared 1800
captain thomas hurd department received first professional guidelines first catalogues published made available public nations well 1829 rearadmiral francis beaufort hydrographer developed eponymous scale introduced first official tide tables 1833 first notices mariners 1834 hydrographic office underwent steady expansion throughout 19th century 1855 chart catalogue listed 1981 charts giving definitive coverage entire world produced 130000 charts annually half sold3
word hydrography comes ancient greek ὕδωρ hydor water γράφω graphō write

largescale hydrography usually undertaken national international organizations sponsor data collection precise surveys publish charts descriptive material navigational purposes science oceanography part outgrowth classical hydrography many respects data interchangeable marine hydrographic data particularly directed toward marine navigation safety navigation marine resource exploration exploitation significant application hydrography principally focused search hydrocarbons
hydrographical measurements include tidal current wave information physical oceanography include bottom measurements particular emphasis marine geographical features pose hazard navigation rocks shoals reefs features obstruct ship passage bottom measurements also include collection nature bottom pertains effective anchoring unlike oceanography hydrography include shore features natural manmade navigation therefore hydrographic survey include accurate positions representations hills mountains even lights towers fixing ships position well physical aspects seabed
hydrography mostly reasons safety adopted number conventions affected portrayal data nautical charts example hydrographic charts designed portray safe navigation therefore usually tend maintain least depths occasionally deemphasize actual submarine topography would portrayed bathymetric charts former mariners tools avoid accident latter best representations actual seabed topographic scientific purposes trends hydrographic practice since 2003–2005 narrowing difference many hydrographic offices maintaining best observed databases making navigationally safe products required coupled preference multiuse surveys data collected nautical charting purposes also used bathymetric portrayal
even though places hydrographic survey data collected sufficient detail portray bottom topography areas hydrographic charts show depth information relevant safe navigation considered product accurately portrays actual shape bottom soundings selected source depth data placement nautical chart selected safe navigation biased show predominately shallowest depths relate safe navigation instance deep area reached surrounded shallow water deep area shown color filled areas show different ranges shallow water equivalent contours topographic since often drawn seaward actual shallowest depth portrayed bathymetric chart show marine topology accurately details covering limitations found part bowditchs american practical navigator another concept affects safe navigation sparsity detailed depth data high resolution sonar systems remote areas available depth information collected lead lines collection method drops weighted line bottom intervals records depth often rowboat sail boat data soundings sounding lines guarantee hazard wreck coral head waiting ruin sailors often navigation collecting boat match todays navigational accuracies hydrographic chart best data available caveat nature caution note legend chart
hydrographic survey quite different bathymetric survey important respects particularly bias toward least depths safety requirements former geomorphologic descriptive requirements latter historically could include echosoundings conducted settings biased toward least depths modern practice hydrographic surveys typically attempt best measure depths observed adjustments navigational safety applied fact
hydrography streams include information stream flows water quality surrounding land basin interior hydrography pays special attention rivers potable water although collected data ship navigational uses intended scientific usage commonly called hydrology
hydrography rivers streams also integral part water management reservoirs united states dedicated stream gauging rating tables determine inflows reservoir outflows irrigation districts water municipalities users captured water riverstream hydrographers handheld bank mounted devices capture sectional flow rate moving water section
