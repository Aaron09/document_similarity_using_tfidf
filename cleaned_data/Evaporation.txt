theory
also kinetic theory gases
molecules liquid evaporate must located near surface moving proper direction sufficient kinetic energy overcome liquidphase intermolecular forces1 small proportion molecules meet criteria rate evaporation since kinetic energy molecule proportional temperature evaporation proceeds quickly higher temperatures fastermoving molecules escape remaining molecules lower average kinetic energy temperature liquid decreases phenomenon also called evaporative cooling evaporating sweat cools human body evaporation also tends proceed quickly higher flow rates gaseous liquid phase liquids higher vapor pressure example laundry clothes line evaporation rapidly windy still three parts evaporation heat atmospheric pressure determines percent humidity movement
molecular level strict boundary liquid state vapor state instead knudsen layer phase undetermined layer molecules thick macroscopic scale clear phase transition interface cannot seen
liquids evaporate visibly given temperature given cooking room temperature molecules tend transfer energy pattern sufficient frequently give molecule heat energy necessary turn vapor however liquids evaporating process much slower thus significantly less visible
evaporative equilibrium




vapor pressure water temperature torr


evaporation takes place enclosed area escaping molecules accumulate vapor liquid many molecules return liquid returning molecules becoming frequent density pressure vapor increases process escape return reaches equilibrium1 vapor said saturated change either vapor pressure density liquid temperature occur system consisting vapor liquid pure substance equilibrium state directly related vapor pressure substance given clausius–clapeyron relation

factors influencing rate evaporation
note used common example however vapor phase gases

concentration substance evaporating
already high concentration substance evaporating given substance evaporate slowly
concentration substances
already saturated substances lower capacity substance evaporatingcitation needed
flow rate
part related concentration points fresh neither already saturated substance substances moving substance time concentration substance less likely time thus encouraging faster evaporation result boundary layer evaporation surface decreasing flow velocity decreasing diffusion distance stagnant layer
intermolecular forces
stronger forces keeping molecules together liquid state energy must escape characterized enthalpy vaporization
pressure
evaporation happens faster less exertion surface keeping molecules launching
surface area
substance larger surface area evaporate faster surface molecules unit volume potentially able escape
temperature substance
higher temperature substance greater kinetic energy molecules surface therefore faster rate evaporation

national weather service measures actual rate evaporation standardized open water surface outdoors various locations nationwide others likewise around world data collected compiled annual evaporation measurements range inches 3000 year
thermodynamics
evaporation endothermic process heat absorbed evaporation
applications

industrial applications include many printing coating processes recovering salts solutions drying variety materials lumber paper cloth chemicals
evaporation concentrate samples common preparatory step many laboratory analyses spectroscopy chromatography systems used purpose include rotary evaporators centrifugal evaporators
clothes hung laundry line even though ambient temperature boiling point water water evaporates accelerated factors humidity heat wind clothes dryer blown clothes allowing water evaporate rapidly

evaporative coolers significantly cool building simply blowing filter saturated water

combustion vaporization
fuel droplets vaporize receive heat mixing gases combustion chamber heat energy also received radiation refractory wall combustion chamber
precombustion vaporization
internal combustion engines rely upon vaporization fuel cylinders form fuelair mixture order burn well chemically correct airfuel mixture total burning gasoline determined parts part gasoline weight changing volume ratio yields 8000 parts part gasoline 80001 volume
film deposition
main article evaporation deposition
thin films deposited evaporating substance condensing onto substrate dissolving substance solvent spreading resulting solution thinly substrate evaporating solvent hertz–knudsen equation often used estimate rate evaporation instances
