dupont invention nylonedit
dupont founded éleuthère irénée pont first produced gunpowder later cellulosebased paints following dupont produced synthetic ammonia chemicals dupont began experimenting development cellulose based fibres eventually producing synthetic fibre rayon duponts experience rayon important precursor development marketing nylon14864236
duponts invention nylon spanned nineyear period ranging start project 1930 exhibition world fair york 193914 project grew structure dupont suggested charles stine 1927 chemical department would composed several small research teams would focus “pioneering research” chemistry would “lead practical applications”1492 harvard instructor wallace hume carothers hired direct polymer research group initially allowed focus pure research building testing theories german chemist hermann staudinger15 successful research undertook greatly improved knowledge polymers contributed science16
spring 1930 carothers team already synthesized polymers neoprene synthetic rubber greatly used white elastic strong paste would later become nylon discoveries carother’s team made shift research pure research approach investigating general polymerization practicallyfocused goal finding “one chemical combination would lend industrial applications”1494
wasn’t beginning 1935 polymer called polymer finally produced first example nylon nylon produced wallace carothers february 1935 duponts research facility dupont experimental station4 desired properties elasticity strength however also required complex manufacturing process would become basis industrial production future dupont obtained patent polymer september 193817 quickly achieved monopoly fibre16
production nylon required interdepartmental collaboration three departments dupont department chemical research ammonia department department rayon ingredients nylon produced using high pressure chemistry main area expertise ammonia department nylon considered “godsend ammonia department”14 financial difficulties reactants nylon soon constituted half ammonia department’s sales helped come period great depression creating jobs revenue dupont14
duponts nylon project demonstrated importance chemical engineering industry helped create jobs furthered advancement chemical engineering techniques fact developed chemical plant provided 1800 jobs used latest technologies time still used model chemical plants today14 “the success nylon project thus ability achieve rapid mobilization large number dupont’s chemists engineers”14100–101 first nylon plant located seaford delaware beginning commercial production december 1939 october 1995 seaford plant designated national historic chemical landmark american chemical society18
origin nameedit
dupont went extensive process generate names product16138–139 1940 john eckelberry dupont stated letters arbitrary copied suffixes fibers cotton rayon later publication dupont context 1978 explained name originally intended norun meaning unravel modified avoid making unjustified claim since products really runproof vowels swapped produce nuron changed nilon make sound less like nerve tonic clarity pronunciation changed y1019
early marketing strategiesedit
important part nylon’s popularity stems dupont’s marketing strategy fibre promoted increase demand product available general market nylon’s commercial announcement occurred october 1938 final session herald tribunes yearly forum current problems site approaching york city worlds fair1516141 “first manmade organic textile fiber” derived “coal water air” promised strong steel fine spider’s web” received enthusiastically audience many middleclass women made headlines newspapers16141 nylon introduced part world tomorrow 1939 york worlds fair20 featured duponts wonder world chemistry golden gate international exposition francisco 19391521 actual nylon stockings shipped selected stores national market 1940 however limited number released sale delaware that16145–146 first public sale nylon stockings occurred october 1939 wilmington delaware 4000 pairs stockings available sold within three hours15
another added bonus campaign meant reducing silk imports japan argument many wary customers nylon even mentioned president roosevelt’s cabinet addressed “vast interesting economic possibilities” five days material formally announced16
however early excitement nylon also caused problems fueled unreasonable expectations nylon would better silk miracle fabric strong steel would last forever never run16145–14710 realizing danger claims “new hosiery held strong steel” runs” pont scaled back terms original announcement especially stating nylon would possess strength steel16
also dupont executives marketing nylon revolutionary manmade material first realize consumers experienced sense unease distrust even fear towards synthetic fabrics16126–128 particularly damaging news story drawing duponts 1938 patent polymer suggested method producing nylon might cadaverine chemical extracted corpses although scientists asserted cadaverine also extracted heating coal public often refused listen case woman confronted lead scientists dupont refused accept rumour true16146–147
dupont changed campaign strategy emphasizing nylon made “coal water” started focusing personal aesthetic aspects nylon rather intrinsic qualities16146–147 nylon thus domesticated16151152 attention shifted material consumer aspect fiber slogans like it’s nylon it’s prettier fast dries”142

however february 1942 nylon production redirected consumer material used military15 duponts production nylon stockings lingerie stopped manufactured nylon used make parachutes tents world ii23
ended return nylon awaited great anticipation although dupont projected yearly production million pairs stockings delays converting back consumer rather wartime production15 1946 demand nylon stockings could satisfied nylon riots case estimated 40000 people lined pittsburgh 13000 pairs nylons10 meantime women nylon tents parachutes left order make blouses wedding dresses2425 1952 production stockings lingerie used world’s nylon dupont focus catering civilian demand continually expanded production
introduction nylon blendsedit
pure nylon hosiery sold wider market problems became apparent nylon stockings found fragile sense thread often tended unravel lengthwise creating ‘runs’14101 people also reported pure nylon textiles could uncomfortable nylons lack absorbency26 moisture stayed inside fabric near skin moist conditions instead wicked away27 nylon fabric could also itchy tended cling sometimes spark result static electrical charge built friction2829 also conditions stockings could decompose16 turning back nylons original components coal water scientists explained result pollution attributing london smog 1952 well poor quality york angeles303132
solution found problems pure nylon fabric blend nylon existing fibres polymers cotton polyester spandex development wide array blended fabrics nylon blends retained desirable properties nylon elasticity durability ability dyed kept clothes prices affordable232 1950 york quartermaster procurement agency nyqmpa developed tested textiles army navy committed developing woolnylon blend ones introduce blends natural synthetic fibres americas textile reporter referred 1951 year blending fibers33 fabric blends included mixes like bunara woolrabbitnylon casmet woolnylonfur34 britain november 1951 inaugural address 198th session royal society encouragement arts manufactures commerce focused blending textiles35
duponts fabric development department cleverly targeted french fashion designers supplying fabric samples 1955 designers coco chanel jean patou christian dior showed gowns created dupont fibers fashion photographer horst horst hired document dupont fabrics10 american fabrics credited blends providing creative possibilities ideas fashions hitherto undreamed of34
longerterm popularityedit
spite shortages 1970s consumption nylon textiles continued grow cent annum 1960s 1980s36 overall production synthetic fibres however dropped worlds textile production 1965 worlds textile production early 1970s36 appeal technologies wore nylon fabric “was going style 1970s”14 also consumers became concerned environmental costs throughout production cycle obtaining materials energy production waste produced creation fibre eventual waste disposal materials biodegradable36 synthetic fibres dominated market since 1950s 1960s 2008update nylon continued represent million pounds world’s production synthetic fibres10
although pure nylon many flaws rarely used derivatives greatly influenced contributed society scientific discoveries relating production plastics polymerization economic impact depression changing women’s fashion nylon revolutionary product10 first flag planted moon symbolic gesture celebration made nylon flag cost speciallydesigned flagpole horizontal would appear fly3738 “nylon great symbols american century doubt cocacola consumer dreams 20th century women technologically advanced product also captured public’s imagination nylon object desire”14182
