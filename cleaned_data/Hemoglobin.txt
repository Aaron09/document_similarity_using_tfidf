irons oxidation state oxyhemoglobinedit
assigning oxygenated hemoglobins oxidation state difficult oxyhemoglobin hbo2 experimental measurement diamagnetic unpaired electrons lowestenergy groundstate electron configurations oxygen iron paramagnetic suggesting least unpaired electron complex lowestenergy form oxygen lowest energy forms relevant oxidation states iron

ironii tends exist highspin configuration four unpaired electrons
ironiii number electrons thus must unpaired electrons energy state

logical possibilities produce diamagnetic spin hbo2

lowspin binds singlet oxygen lowspin iron singlet oxygen diamagnetic however singlet form oxygen higherenergy form molecule
lowspin binds o2•− superoxide unpaired electrons couple antiferromagnetically giving observed diamagnetic properties iron oxidized lost electron oxygen reduced gained electron

another possible model lowspin binds peroxide o22− ruled iron paramagnetic although peroxide diamagnetic iron oxidized electrons oxygen reduced electrons
