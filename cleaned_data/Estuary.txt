word estuary derived latin word aestuarium meaning tidal inlet derived term aestus meaning tide many definitions proposed describe estuary widely accepted definition semienclosed coastal body water free connection open within water measurably diluted freshwater derived land drainage1 however definition excludes number coastal water bodies coastal lagoons brackish seas comprehensive definition estuary semienclosed body water connected tidal limit salt intrusion limit receiving freshwater runoff however freshwater inflow perennial connection closed part year tidal influence negligible3 broad definition also includes fjords lagoons river mouths tidal creeks estuary dynamic ecosystem connection open water enters rhythm tides water entering estuary diluted fresh water flowing rivers streams pattern dilution varies different estuaries depends volume fresh water tidal range extent evaporation water estuary2
classification based geomorphologyedit
drowned river valleysedit
main article
drowned river valleys also known coastal plain estuaries places level rising relative land water progressively penetrates river valleys topography estuary remains similar river valley common type estuary temperate climates wellstudied estuaries include severn estuary united kingdom dollard along dutchgerman border
widthtodepth ratio estuaries typically large appearing wedgeshaped crosssection inner part broadening deepening seaward water depths rarely exceed examples type estuary hudson river chesapeake delaware along midatlantic coast galveston tampa along gulf coast5
lagoontype barbuiltedit
barbuilt estuaries found place deposition sediment kept pace rising level estuaries shallow separated sand spits barrier islands relatively common tropical subtropical locations
estuaries semiisolated ocean waters barrier beaches barrier islands barrier spits formation barrier beaches partially encloses estuary narrow inlets allowing contact ocean waters barbuilt estuaries typically develop gently sloping plains located along tectonically stable edges continents marginal coasts extensive along atlantic gulf coasts areas active coastal deposition sediments tidal ranges less barrier beaches enclose barbuilt estuaries developed several ways

building offshore bars wave action sand floor deposited elongated bars parallel shoreline
reworking sediment discharge rivers wave current wind action beaches overwash flats dunes
engulfment mainland beach ridges ridges developed erosion coastal plain sediments around 5000 years level rise resulting breaching ridges flooding coastal lowlands forming shallow lagoons
elongation barrier spits erosion headlands action longshore currents spits growing direction littoral drift

barrier beaches form shallow water generally parallel shoreline resulting long narrow estuaries average water depth usually less rarely exceeds examples barbuilt estuaries barnegat jersey laguna madre6 texas pamlico sound north carolina
fjordtypeedit
fjords formed pleistocene glaciers deepened widened existing river valleys become ushaped cross sections mouths typically rocks bars sills glacial deposits effects modifying estuarine circulation
fjordtype estuaries formed deeply eroded valleys formed glaciers ushaped estuaries typically steep sides rock bottoms underwater sills contoured glacial movement estuary shallowest mouth terminal glacial moraines rock bars form sills restrict water flow upper reaches estuary depth exceed 1000 widthtodepth ratio generally small estuaries shallow sills tidal oscillations affect water depth sill waters deeper remain stagnant long time occasional exchange deep water estuary ocean sill depth deep water circulation less restricted slow steady exchange water estuary ocean fjordtype estuaries found along coasts alaska puget sound region western washington state british columbia eastern canada greenland iceland zealand norway
tectonically producededit
estuaries formed subsidence land ocean land movement associated faulting volcanoes landslides inundation eustatic level rise holocene epoch also contributed formation estuaries small number tectonically produced estuaries example francisco formed crustal movements andreas fault system causing inundation lower reaches sacramento joaquin rivers7
classification based water circulationedit
also estuarine water circulation
salt wedgeedit
type estuary river output greatly exceeds marine input tidal effects minor importance fresh water floats seawater layer gradually thins moves seaward denser seawater moves landward along bottom estuary forming wedgeshaped layer thinner approaches land velocity difference develops layers shear forces generate internal waves interface mixing seawater upward freshwater example salt wedge estuary mississippi river7
partially mixededit
tidal forcing increases river output becomes less marine input current induced turbulence causes mixing whole water column salinity varies longitudinally rather vertically leading moderately stratified condition examples include chesapeake narragansett bay7
wellmixededit
tidal mixing forces exceed river output resulting well mixed water column disappearance vertical salinity gradient freshwaterseawater boundary eliminated intense turbulent mixing eddy effects lower reaches delaware raritan river jersey examples vertically homogenous estuaries7
inverseedit
inverse estuaries occur climates evaporation greatly exceeds inflow fresh water salinity maximum zone formed riverine oceanic water flow close surface towards zone8 water pushed downward spreads along bottom seaward landward direction3 example inverse estuary spencer gulf south australia
intermittentedit
estuary type varies dramatically depending freshwater input capable changing wholly marine embayment estuary types910
physiochemical variationedit
important variable characteristics estuary water concentration dissolved oxygen salinity sediment load extreme spatial variability salinity range near zero tidal limit tributary rivers estuary mouth point salinity vary considerably time seasons making harsh environment organisms sediment often settles intertidal mudflats extremely difficult colonize points attachment exist algae vegetation based habitat establishedclarification needed sediment also clog feeding respiratory structures species special adaptations exist within mudflat species cope problem lastly dissolved oxygen variation cause problems life forms nutrientrich sediment manmade sources promote primary production life cycles perhaps leading eventual decay removing dissolved oxygen water thus hypoxic anoxic zones develop11
implications marine lifeedit
estuaries provide habitats large number organisms support high productivity estuaries provide habitats many fish nurseries depending upon locations world salmon trout12 also migratory bird populations blacktailed godwit13 make essential estuaries
main challenges estuarine life variability salinity sedimentation many species fish invertebrates various methods control conform shifts salt concentrations termed osmoconformers osmoregulators many animals also burrow avoid predation live stable sedimental environment however large numbers bacteria found within sediment high oxygen demand reduces levels oxygen within sediment often resulting partially anoxic conditions exacerbated limited water flux
phytoplankton primary producers estuaries move water bodies flushed tides productivity largely dependent upon turbidity water main phytoplankton present diatoms dinoflagellates abundant sediment
important remember primary source food many organisms estuaries including bacteria detritus settlement sedimentation
human impactedit
thirtytwo largest cities world early 1990s twentytwo located estuaries14
ecosystems estuaries threat human activities pollution overfishing also threatened sewage coastal settlement land clearance much estuaries affected events upstream concentrate materials pollutants sediments15 land runoff industrial agricultural domestic waste enter rivers discharged estuaries contaminants introduced disintegrate rapidly marine environment plastics pesticides furans dioxins phenols heavy metals
toxins accumulate tissues many species aquatic life process called bioaccumulation also accumulate benthic environments estuaries muds geological record human activities last century elemental composition biofilm reflect areas estuary impacted human activities time shift basic composition ecosystem reversible irreversible changes abiotic biotic parts systems bottom up16
example chinese russian industrial pollution phenols heavy metals devastated fish stocks amur river damaged estuary soil17
estuaries tend naturally eutrophic land runoff discharges nutrients estuaries human activities land runoff also includes many chemicals used fertilizers agriculture well waste livestock humans excess oxygendepleting chemicals water lead hypoxia creation dead zones18 result reductions water quality fish animal populations overfishing also occurs chesapeake flourishing oyster population almost wiped overfishing oysters filter pollutants either shape small packets deposited bottom harmless historically oysters filtered estuarys entire water volume excess nutrients every three four days today process takes almost year19 sediment nutrients algae cause problems local waters
