vegetable triglyceride extracted plant1 term vegetable narrowly defined referring plant oils liquid room temperature2 broadly defined without regard substances state matter given temperature3 reason vegetable oils solid room temperature sometimes called vegetable fats contrast triglycerides vegetable waxes lack glycerin structure although many plant parts yield commercial practice extracted primarily seeds
food packaging term vegetable often used ingredients lists instead specifying exact plant used especially used less desirable consumer used palm canola soybean safflower oils whereas coconut olive perceived desirablecitation needed

uses triglyceride vegetable oiledit
oils extracted plants used since ancient times many cultures example 4000yearold kitchen unearthed indianas charlestown state park archaeologist mccullough indiana universitypurdue university fort wayne found evidence large slabs rock used crush hickory nuts extracted boiling water4 archaeological evidence shows olives turned olive 6000 4500 presentday israel palestine6
culinary usesedit
also cooking
many vegetable oils consumed directly indirectly ingredients food role share animal fats including butter ghee lard schmaltz oils serve number purposes role

shortening give pastry crumbly texture
texture oils serve make ingredients stick together less
flavor less flavorful oils command premium prices oils olive sesame almond chosen specifically flavor impart
flavor base oils also carry flavors ingredients since many flavors chemicals soluble

secondly oils heated used cook foods oils suitable objective must high flash point oils include major cooking oils soybean rapeseed canola sunflower safflower peanut cottonseed tropical oils coconut palm rice bran oils particularly valued asian cultures hightemperature cooking unusually high flash points
hydrogenated oilsedit
unsaturated vegetable oils transformed partial complete hydrogenation oils higher melting point hydrogenation process involves sparging high temperature pressure hydrogen presence catalyst typically powdered nickel compound carbon–carbon doublebond chemically reduced single bond hydrogen atoms form single bonds carbon atoms elimination double bonds adding hydrogen atoms called saturation degree saturation increases progresses toward fully hydrogenated hydrogenated increase resistance rancidity oxidation change physical characteristics degree saturation increases oils viscosity melting point increase
hydrogenated oils foods never completely satisfactory center triglyceride shielded somewhat fatty acids hydrogenation occurs fatty acids thus making resulting brittlecitation needed margarine made naturally saturated oils plastic spreadable margarine made hydrogenated oilcitation needed full hydrogenation produces largely saturated fatty acids partial hydrogenation results transformation unsaturated fatty acids unsaturated trans fatty acids mixture heat used hydrogenation partially hydrogenated oils trans fats linked increased risk mortality coronary heart disease7 among increased health risks
standard identity product labeled vegetable margarine specifies canola safflower sunflower corn soybean peanut used8 products labeled vegetable margarine restriction
industrial usesedit
vegetable oils used ingredient component many manufactured products
many vegetable oils used make soaps skin products candles perfumes personal care cosmetic products oils particularly suitable drying oils used making paints wood treatment products dammar mixture linseed dammar resin example used almost exclusively treating hulls wooden boats vegetable oils increasingly used electrical industry insulators vegetable oils toxic environment biodegradable spilled high flash fire points however vegetable oils less stable chemically generally used systems exposed oxygen expensive crude distillate synthetic tetraesters similar vegetable oils four fatty acid chains compared normal three found natural ester manufactured fischer esterification tetraesters generally high stability oxidation found engine lubricants vegetable used produce biodegradable hydraulic fluid9 lubricant10
limiting factor industrial uses vegetable oils oils susceptible becoming rancid oils stable mineral thus preferred industrial uses castor numerous industrial uses owing presence hydroxyl group fatty acid castor precursor nylon
food additiveedit
vegetable used production foods aafco defines vegetable context product vegetable origin obtained extracting seeds fruits processed edible purposes
fueledit
main article vegetable fuel
vegetable oils also used make biodiesel used like conventional diesel vegetable blends used unmodified vehicles straight vegetable also known pure plant needs specially prepared vehicles method heating reduce viscosity vegetable oils alternative energy growing availability biodiesel around world increasing
nnfcc estimate total greenhouse savings using vegetable oils place fossil fuelbased alternatives fuel production range 10011
productionedit
production process vegetable involves removal plant components typically seeds done mechanical extraction using mill chemical extraction using solvent extracted purified required refined chemically altered
mechanical extractionedit
oils removed mechanical extraction termed crushing pressing method typically used produce traditional oils olive coconut preferred healthfood customers united states europecitation needed several different types mechanical extraction12 expellerpressing extraction common though screw press press ghani powered mortar pestle also used oilseed presses commonly used developing countries among people extraction methods would prohibitively expensive ghani primarily used india13 amount extracted using methods varies widely shown following table extracting mowrah butter india14

solvent extractionedit
processing vegetable commercial applications commonly done chemical extraction using solvent extracts produces higher yields quicker less expensive common solvent petroleumderived hexane technique used newer industrial oils soybean corn oils
supercritical carbon dioxide used nontoxic alternative solvents16
hydrogenationedit
oils partially hydrogenated produce various ingredient oils lightly hydrogenated oils similar physical characteristics regular resistant becoming rancid margarine oils need mostly solid margarine melt warm rooms needs completely liquid doesnt leave lardy taste mouth
hardening vegetable done raising blend vegetable catalyst nearvacuum high temperatures introducing hydrogen causes carbon atoms break doublebonds carbons carbon forming singlebond hydrogen atom adding hydrogen atoms makes solid raises smoke point makes stable
hydrogenated vegetable oils differ major ways oils equally saturated hydrogenation easier hydrogen come contact fatty acids triglyceride less easy come contact center fatty acid makes resulting brittle tropical margarines less spreadablecompared difference trans fatty acids often called trans formed hydrogenation reactor amount much percent weight partially hydrogenated hydrogenated oils especially partially hydrogenated oils higher amounts trans fatty acids increasingly thought unhealthy
deodorizationedit
processing edible oils heated vacuum near smoke point water introduced bottom water immediately converted steam bubbles carrying chemicals watersoluble steam sparging removes impurities impart unwanted flavors odors deodorization manufacture vegetable oils nearly soybean corn canola oils found supermarket shelves deodorization stage removes trace amounts odors flavors lightens color
occupational exposureedit
people breathe vegetable mist workplace occupational safety health administration osha legal limit permissible exposure limit vegetable mist exposure workplace mgm3 total exposure mgm3 respiratory exposure 8hour workday national institute occupational safety health niosh recommended exposure limit mgm3 total exposure mgm3 respiratory exposure 8hour workday17
