stereo sound systems divided forms first true natural stereo live sound captured natural reverberation ambience present array microphones signal reproduced multiple loudspeakers recreate closely possible live sound
secondly artificial panpot stereo singlechannel mono sound reproduced multiple loudspeakers varying relative amplitude signal sent speaker artificial direction relative listener suggested control used vary relative amplitude signal known panpot panoramic potentiometer combining multiple panpotted mono signals together complete entirely artificial sound field created
technical usage true stereo means sound recording sound reproduction uses stereographic projection encode relative positions objects events recorded
twochannel stereo recording microphones placed strategically chosen locations relative sound source recording simultaneously recorded channels similar distinct timeofarrival soundpressurelevel information playback listeners brain uses subtle differences timing sound level triangulate positions recorded objects stereo recordings often cannot played monaural systems without significant loss fidelity since microphone records wavefront slightly different time wavefronts phase result constructive destructive interference occur tracks played back speaker phenomenon known phase cancellation

modern stereophonic soundedit
modern stereophonic technology invented 1930s british engineer alan blumlein patented stereo records stereo films also surround sound6
early 1931 blumlein wife local cinema sound reproduction systems early talkies invariably single speakers could lead somewhat disconcerting effect actor side screen whilst voice appeared come blumlein declared wife found make sound follow actor across screen
genesis ideas uncertain explained isaac shoenberg late summer 1931 earliest notes subject dated september 1931 patent title improvements relating soundtransmission soundrecording soundreproducing systems application dated december 1931 accepted june 1933 patent number 3943257
patent covered many ideas stereo used today claims include

shuffling circuit aimed preserve directional effect sound spaced pair microphones reproduced stereo headphones instead pair loudspeakers
coincident pair velocity microphones axes right angles still known blumlein pair
recording channels single groove record using groove walls right angles degrees vertical
stereo disccutting head
using hybrid transformers matrix left right signals difference signals

blumlein began binaural experiments early 1933 first stereo discs later year twentyfive years method became standard stereo phonograph discs discs used walls groove right angles order carry channels
much development work system cinematic reach completion 1935 blumleins short test films notably trains hayes station lasts minutes seconds walking talking film original intent sound follow actor fully realised8
