brian clough metrics schmetrics heck determine uavs autonomy anyway28
example semiautonomous vehicles unmanned spacecraft autonomy increasing feature unmanned vehicles objectives

mandatory functions


several spacecraft formation flight adjust relative positions interferometric measurements wide basis performed


cost reduction


failure detection recovery spacecraft system without ground station involvement reduces updownlink usage reduces operational costs ground


robotics

autonomous space craft might make certain decisions based imagery observation preprogrammed algorithm determine possible logical outcome perform task without controllers nand types parameters autonomy space relate sociopolitical definitions talking device make basic convoluted decisions based logic electronic usage x37b military space plane example
true autonomy however device entity would need longer leash able complete complex missions without human intra direction system would automate elements total process making whole system larger including devices multicommunicate without involving ground based technicians communications military might want send possibly interceptable signals said
nonsensical please revise
vvthis toovv
example automated ground based tracking control sending included additional satellites andor space planes devices autonomous seacraft x37b missions could someday become totally autonomous

basically send mission recover lands
obviously autonomy authority hierarchy whereby command override effect

ground controllers want take control space craft time typical mission though preprogrammed perform directed land perform task andor software sense condition signal sent ground ifthen land unmanned spacecraft without direction ground systems happen interact necessary condition autonomy device becomes autonomous total network becomes intelligent time secure
