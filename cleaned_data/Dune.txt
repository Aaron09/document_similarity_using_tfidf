linearedit




large linear dunes great sand southwest egypt seen international space station distance dune 1525


straight slightly sinuous sand ridges typically much longer wide known linear dunes kilometres miles long linear dunes merge form yshaped compound dunes many form bidirectional wind regimes long axes dunes extend resultant direction sand movement5
linear loess hills known pahas superficially similar hills appear formed last permafrost conditions dominated sparse tundra vegetation
staredit




isolated star dune


radially symmetrical star dunes pyramidal sand mounds slipfaces three arms radiate high center mound tend accumulate areas multidirectional wind regimes star dunes grow upward rather laterally dominate grand oriental sahara deserts occur around margins sand seas particularly near topographic barriers southeast badain jaran desert china star dunes metres tall tallest dunes earth
domeedit
oval circular mounds generally lack slipface dome dunes rare occur upwind margins sand seas
parabolicedit




schematic coastal parabolic dunes


ushaped mounds sand convex noses trailed elongated arms parabolic dunes dunes formed blowout dunes erosion vegetated sand leads ushaped depression elongated arms held place vegetation largest known earth reaches sometimes dunes called ushaped blowout hairpin dunes well known coastal deserts unlike crescent shaped dunes crests point upwind bulk sand dune migrates forward
plan view ushaped vshaped mounds wellsorted fine medium sand elongated arms extend upwind behind central part dune slipfaces often occur outer side nose outer slopes arms
dunes often occur semiarid areas precipitation retained lower parts dune underlying soils stability dunes attributed vegetative cover recent research pointed water main source parabolic dune stability vegetation covers them—grasses shrubs trees—help anchor trailing arms inland deserts parabolic dunes commonly originate extend downwind blowouts sand sheets partly anchored vegetation also originate beach sands extend inland vegetated areas coastal zones shores large lakes
parabolic dunes reach heights higher tens metres except nose vegetation stops slows advance accumulating sand
simple parabolic dunes arms trail upwind behind leading nose compound parabolic dunes coalesced features several sets trailing arms complex parabolic dunes include subsidiary superposed coalesced forms usually barchanoid linear shapes
parabolic dunes like crescent dunes occur areas strong winds mostly unidirectional although dunes found areas characterized variable wind speeds effective winds associated growth migration parabolic crescent dunes probably consistent wind direction
grain size wellsorted fine medium sands parabolic dunes loose sand steep slopes outer flanks inner slopes mostly well packed anchored vegetation corridors individual dunes dune arms oriented direction interdune corridors generally swept clear loose sand corridors usually traversed trailing arms dune however cross straight dune going trailing arms difficult also traversing nose difficult well nose usually made loose sand without much vegetation
type extensive parabolic dune lacks discernible slipfaces mostly coarse grained sand known zibar6 term zibar comes arabic word describe rolling transverse ridges hard surface7 dunes small relief found many places across planet wyoming united states saudi arabia australia spacing zibars ranges metres dont become metres high8 dunes form ninety degrees prevailing wind blows away small finegrained sand leaving behind coarser grained sand form crest9
longitudinal seif dunesedit




khali arabian empty quarter sand dunes imaged terra dunes seif dunes origin barchans suggested stubby remnant hooks seen many dunes wind would left right


longitudinal dunes also called seif dunes arabic word sword elongate parallel prevailing wind possibly caused larger dune smaller sides blown away seif dunes sharpcrested common sahara range height length southern third arabian peninsula vast called khali empty quarter contains seif dunes stretch almost reach heights
seif dunes thought develop barchans change usual wind direction occurs wind direction lead development wing development original wings prevailing wind becomes dominant lengthy period time dune revert barchan form exaggerated wing strong wind return exaggerated wing extend eventually supplied sand prevailing wind returns wing continue grow wind conditions thus producing seif dune seif dune slipface develops side facing away strong wind slipface barchan faces direction movement sheltered troughs highly developed seif dunes barchans formed wind unidirectional
transverse dune perpendicular prevailing wind probably caused steady buildup sand already existing minuscule mound
reversing dunesedit
occurring wherever winds periodically reverse direction reversing dunes varieties shapes dunes typically major minor slipfaces oriented opposite directions
dune shapes occur three forms simple compound complex simple dunes basic forms minimum number slipfaces define geometric type compound dunes large dunes smaller dunes similar type slipface orientation superimposed complex dunes combinations dune types crescentic dune star dune superimposed crest common complex dune simple dunes represent wind regime changed intensity direction since formation dune compound complex dunes suggest intensity direction wind changed

coastal dunesedit




coastal dunes covered grasses around mouth liver river denmark


dunes form beach wide enough allow accumulation windblown sand prevailing onshore winds tend blow sand inland obstacles—for example vegetation pebbles on—tend slow wind lead deposition sand grains11 small incipient dunes shadow dunes tend grow vertical direction obstacle slowing wind also grow vertically vegetation coastal dunes expand laterally result lateral growth coastal plants seed rhizome1213 models coastal dunes suggest final equilibrium height related distance water line vegetation grow14 additionally height coastal dunes impacted storm events erode dunes recent work suggested coastal dunes tend evolve toward high morphology depending growth rate dunes relative storm frequency certain conditions high dunes possible dunes system shows bistable dynamics1516
dunes provide privacy shelter wind
ecological succession coastal dunesedit
dune forms plant succession occurs conditions embryo dune harsh salt spray carried strong winds dune well drained often composed calcium carbonate seashells rotting seaweed brought storm waves adds nutrients allow pioneer species colonize dune pioneer species marram grass wort grass grasses united kingdom plants well adapted harsh conditions foredune typically deep roots reach water table root nodules produce nitrogen compounds protected stoma reducing transpiration also deep roots bind sand together dune grows foredune sand blown grasses grasses nitrogen soil meaning less hardy plants colonize dunes typically heather heaths gorses adapted soil water content small prickly leaves reduce transpiration heather adds humus soil usually replaced coniferous trees tolerate soil caused accumulation decomposition organic matter nitrate leaching17 coniferous forests heathland common climax communities sand dune systems
young dunes called yellow dunes dunes high humus content called grey dunes leaching occurs dunes washing humus slacks slacks much developed exposed tops dunes usually slacks rare species developed tendency dune slacks soil waterlogged marsh plants survive plants would include creeping willow cotton grass yellow iris reeds rushes species tendency natterjack toads breed

nabkha dunesedit
nabkha coppice dune small dune anchored vegetation usually indicate desertification soil erosion serve nesting burrow sites animals
subaqueous dunesedit
subaqueous underwater dunes form sand gravel actions water flow ubiquitous natural channels rivers estuaries also form engineered canals pipelines dunes move downstream upstream slope eroded sediment deposited downstream slope typical bedform construction18
dunes often form continuous train dunes showing remarkable similarity wavelength height
dunes channel significantly increase flow resistance presence growth playing major part river flooding
lithified dunesedit




crossbedding lithified aeolian sand dunes preserved sandstone zion national park utah


lithified consolidated sand dune type sandstone formed marine aeolian sand dune becomes compacted hardened form water passing rock carry deposit minerals alter color rock crossbedded layers stacks lithified dunes produce crosshatching patterns seen zion national park western united states
slang term used southwest consolidated hardened sand dunes slickrock name introduced pioneers west steelrimmed wagon wheels could gain traction rock
desertificationedit
main article desertification
sand dunes negative impact humans encroach human habitats sand dunes move different means helped along wind dunes move saltation sand particles skip along ground like bouncing ball skipping particles land knock particles cause move well process known creep slightly stronger winds particles collide midair causing sheet flows major dust storm dunes move tens metres sheet flows also case snow sand avalanches falling slipface dunes—that face away winds—also move dunes forward
sand threatens buildings crops africa middle east china drenching sand dunes stops migration approach quite destructive dunes animal habitats uses valuable resource sand fences might also slow movement crawl geologists still analyzing results optimum fence designscitation needed preventing sand dunes overwhelming towns villages agricultural areas become priority united nations environment programme planting dunes vegetation also helps stabilise
conservationedit
