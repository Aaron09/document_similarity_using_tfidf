distance versus directed distance displacementedit




distance along path compared displacement


distance cannot negative distance travelled never decreases distance scalar quantity magnitude whereas displacement vector quantity magnitude direction directed distance positive zero negative scalar quantity
distance covered vehicle example recorded odometer person animal object along curved path point point distinguished straightline distance example whatever distance covered round trip back displacement zero start points coincide general straightline distance equal distance travelled except journeys straight line
directed distanceedit
directed distances distances directional sense determined along straight lines along curved lines directed distance point point direction line euclidean vector space distance falls negative distance falls side
directed distance along curved line vector represented segment curved line defined endpoints specific information indicating sense direction ideal real motion endpoint segment figure instance labelling endpoints indicate sense ordered sequence assumed implies starting point
displacementedit
displacement special kind directed distance defined mechanics directed distance called displacement distance along straight line minimum distance positions occupied particle different instants time implies motion particle distance traveled particle must always greater equal displacement equality occurring particle moves along straight path
another kind directed distance different particles point masses given time instance distance center gravity earth center gravity moon strictly imply motion falls category
