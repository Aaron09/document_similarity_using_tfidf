acceleration deceleration value negative common experience vehicle accelerates rear usually sinks front rises depending suspension likewise braking front noses rear rises1
effect wheelbase weight distribution vehicle wheelbase dimensions crucial balance steering example much greater weight load rear tends understeer lack load force front tires therefore grip friction crucial towing singleaxle caravan distribute caravans weight downthrust towhook pounds force likewise oversteer even spin much force front tires enough rear tires also turning lateral torque placed upon tires imparts turning force depends upon length tire distances thus short wheelbase short lever rear wheel result greater lateral force rear tire means greater acceleration less time driver adjust prevent spin worse
wheelbases provide basis common vehicle size class systems
varying wheelbases within nameplateedit
luxury vehicles offered longwheelbase variants increase spaciousness therefore luxury vehicle practice often found fullsize cars like mercedesbenz sclass ultraluxury vehicles rollsroyce phantom even large family cars like rover came limousine versions prime minister united kingdom tony blair given longwheelbase version rover official use2
contrast coup√© varieties vehicles honda accord usually built shorter wheelbases sedans derived
bikesedit
main article bicycle motorcycle geometry
wheelbase many commercially available bicycles motorcycles short relative height centers mass able perform stoppies wheelies
skateboardsedit
skateboarding word wheelbase used distance inner pairs mounting holes deck different distance rotational centers wheel pairs reason alternative decks sold prefabricated holes usually without trucks wheels therefore easier prefabricated holes measuring describing characteristic deck
common misconception choice wheelbase influenced height skateboarder however length deck would better candidate wheelbase affects characteristics useful different speeds terrains regardless height skateboarder example deck long wheelbase inches respond slowly turns often desirable high speeds deck short wheelbase inches respond quickly turns often desirable skating backyard pools terrains requiring quick intense turns
railedit
rail vehicles wheelbase follows similar concept however since wheels different sizes example steam locomotive measurement taken points wheels contact rail centers wheels
vehicles wheelsets axles mounted inside vehicle frame mostly steam locomotives wheelbase distance frontmost rearmost wheelsets
vehicles wheelsets mounted bogies amer trucks three wheelbase measurements distinguished

distance pivot points frontmost rearmost bogie
distance frontmost rearmost wheelsets vehicle
distance frontmost rearmost wheelsets bogie

wheelbase affects rail vehicles capability negotiate curves shortwheelbased vehicles negotiate sharper curves larger wheelbase locomotives inner wheels lack flanges order pass curves
wheelbase also affects load vehicle poses track track infrastructure bridges conditions equal shorter wheelbase vehicle represents concentrated load track longer wheelbase vehicle railway lines designed take predetermined maximum load unit length tonnes meter pounds foot rail vehicles wheelbase designed according intended gross weight higher gross weight longer wheelbase must
