overviewedit
classical view philosophy science goal science prove hypotheses like swans white induce observational data popper argued would require inference general rule number individual cases inadmissible deductive logic24 however finds single swan white deductive logic admits conclusion statement swans white false falsificationism thus strives questioning falsification hypotheses instead proving
statement questioned using observation needs least theoretically possible come conflict observation observation falsificationism thus criterion demarcation needed distinguish statements come conflict observation cannot chorlton 2012 popper chose falsifiability name criterion

proposal based upon asymmetry verifiability falsifiability asymmetry results logical form universal statements never derivable singular statements contradicted singular statements
karl popper logic scientific discovery

popper stressed unfalsifiable statements important science26 contrary intuition unfalsifiable statements embedded deductively entailed falsifiable theories example mortal unfalsifiable logical consequence falsifiable theory every dies reaches years3 similarly ancient metaphysical unfalsifiable idea existence atoms corresponding falsifiable modern theories popper invented notion metaphysical research programs name unfalsifiable ideas4 contrast positivism held statements meaningless cannot verified falsified popper claimed falsifiability merely special case general notion criticizability even though admitted empirical refutation effective methods theories criticized criticizability contrast falsifiability thus rationality comprehensive logical limits though claim controversial even among proponents poppers philosophy critical rationalism
naïve falsificationedit
types statements observational categoricaledit
work beginning 1930s popper gave falsifiability renewed emphasis criterion empirical statements science popper noticed types statements particular value scientists5
first statements observations white swan logicians call statements singular existential statements since assert existence particular thing equivalent predicate calculus statement form exists swan white
second statements categorize instances something swans white logicians call statements universal usually parsed form swan white scientific laws commonly supposed type difficult question methodology science move observations laws validly infer universal statement number existential statements
inductivist methodology supposed somehow move series singular existential statements universal statement move white swan white swan universal statement swans white method clearly deductively invalid since always possible nonwhite swan eluded observation fact discovery australian black swan demonstrated deductive invalidity particular statement
inductive categorical inferenceedit
popper held science could grounded inferential basis proposed falsification solution problem induction popper noticed although singular existential statement white swan cannot used affirm universal statement used show false singular existential observation black swan serves show universal statement swans white false—in logic called modus tollens black swan implies nonwhite swan turn implies something swan white hence swans white false nothing swan white
notices white swan conclude

wish conjecture

impractical observe swans world verify white
even statement swans white testable falsifiable testing many swans researcher finds single black swan statement swans white would falsified counterexample single black swan

although logic naïve falsification valid rather limited nearly statement made data long makes requisite compensatory adjustments popper drew attention limitations logic scientific discovery response criticism pierre duhem quine expounded argument detail calling confirmation holism logically falsify universal must find true falsifying singular statement popper pointed always possible change universal statement existential statement falsification occur hearing black swan observed australia might introduce hypothesis swans white except found australia might adopt another cynical view observers australian bird watchers incompetent
thus naïve falsification ought supply handling competing hypotheses many subject controversies instance conspiracy theories urban legends people arguing support observation argue nothing normal differences appearances small statistically significant side concede observation occurred universal statement falsified consequence therefore naïve falsification enable scientists rely objective criteria present definitive falsification universal statements
falsificationismedit
naïve falsificationism unsuccessful attempt prescribe rationally unavoidable method science sophisticated methodological falsification hand prescription scientists ought behave matter choice object arrive incremental process whereby theories become less
naïve falsification considers scientific statements individually scientific theories formed groups sorts statements groups must accepted rejected scientists scientific theories always defended addition hypotheses popper decision required part scientist accept reject statements make theory might falsify point weight hypotheses disregarded falsifying observations become great becomes unreasonable support base theory longer decision made reject
place naïve falsification popper envisioned science progressing successive rejection falsified theories rather falsified statements falsified theories replaced theories account phenomena falsified prior theory greater explanatory power example aristotelian mechanics explained observations everyday situations falsified galileos experiments6 replaced newtonian mechanics accounted phenomena noted galileo others newtonian mechanics reach included observed motion planets mechanics gases youngian wave theory light waves carried luminiferous aether replaced newtons many classical greeks particles light turn falsified michelsonmorley experiment superseded maxwells electrodynamics einsteins special relativity account newly observed phenomena furthermore newtonian mechanics applied atomic scale replaced quantum mechanics theory could provide answer ultraviolet catastrophe gibbs paradox electron orbits could exist without particles radiating away energy spiraling towards centre thus theory posit existence unintuitive concepts energy levels quanta heisenbergs uncertainty principle
stage experimental observation made theory untenable falsified theory found greater explanatory power could account previously unexplained phenomena result provided greater opportunity falsification
criterion demarcationedit
popper uses falsification criterion demarcation draw sharp line theories scientific unscientific useful know statement theory falsifiable reason provides understanding ways might assess theory might least saved attempting falsify nonfalsifiable theory come unfalsifiable theory unsupportable popper claimed theory falsifiable scientific
popperian criterion excludes domain science unfalsifiable statements whole theories contain falsifiable statements thus leaves duhemian problem constitutes whole theory well problem makes statement meaningful poppers falsificationism thus alternative verificationism also acknowledgement conceptual distinction previous theories ignored
verificationismedit
