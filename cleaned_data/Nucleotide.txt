nucleotides organic molecules serve monomer units forming nucleic acid polymers deoxyribonucleic acid ribonucleic acid essential biomolecules lifeforms earth nucleotides building blocks nucleic acids composed three subunit molecules nitrogenous base fivecarbon sugar ribose deoxyribose least phosphate group also known phosphate nucleotides
nucleoside nitrogenous base 5carbon sugar thus nucleoside plus phosphate group yields nucleotide
nucleotides also play central role lifeform metabolism fundamental cellular level carry packets chemical energy—in form nucleoside triphosphates utp—throughout cell many cellular functions demand energy include synthesizing amino acids proteins cell membranes parts moving cell moving cell parts internally intercellularly dividing cell etc1 addition nucleotides participate cell signaling cgmp camp incorporated important cofactors enzymatic reactions coenzyme nadp
