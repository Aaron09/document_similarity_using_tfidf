lava composition




pāhoehoe ʻaʻā lava flows side side island hawaii september 2007


composition almost lava earths crust dominated silicate minerals mostly feldspars olivine pyroxenes amphiboles micas quartz
silicate lavas
igneous rocks form lava flows erupted classified three chemical types felsic intermediate mafic four includes superheated ultramafic classes primarily chemical however chemistry lava also tends correlate magma temperature viscosity mode eruption
felsic lava
felsic silicic lavas rhyolite dacite typically form lava spines lava domes coulees thick short lava flows associated pyroclastic fragmental deposits silicic lava flows extremely viscous typically fragment extrude producing blocky autobreccias high viscosity strength result chemistry high silica aluminium potassium sodium calcium forming polymerized liquid rich feldspar quartz thus higher viscosity magma types felsic magmas erupt temperatures 1202 1382 unusually 1740 rhyolite lavas however flow distances many tens kilometres snake river plain northwestern united states
intermediate lava
intermediate andesitic lavas lower aluminium silica usually somewhat richer magnesium iron intermediate lavas form andesite domes block lavas occur steep composite volcanoes andes poorer aluminium silica felsic lavas also commonly hotter range 1380 1740 tend less viscous greater temperatures tend destroy polymerized bonds within magma promoting fluid behaviour also greater tendency form phenocrysts higher iron magnesium tends manifest darker groundmass also occasionally amphibole pyroxene phenocrysts
mafic lava
mafic basaltic lavas typified high ferromagnesian content generally erupt temperatures excess 1740 basaltic magma high iron magnesium relatively lower aluminium silica taken together reduces degree polymerization within melt owing higher temperatures viscosities relatively although still thousands times higher water degree polymerization high temperature favors chemical diffusion common large wellformed phenocrysts within mafic lavas basalt lavas tend produce lowprofile shield volcanoes flood basalt fields fluidal lava flows long distances vent thickness basalt lava particularly slope much greater thickness moving lava flow time basalt lavas inflate supply lava beneath solidified crust basalt lavas ʻaʻā pāhoehoe types rather block lavas underwater form pillow lavas rather similar entrailtype pahoehoe lavas land
ultramafic lava
ultramafic lavas komatiite highly magnesian magmas form boninite take composition temperatures eruptions extreme komatiites contain magnesium oxide thought erupted temperatures 1600 2910 temperature polymerization mineral compounds creating highly mobile liquid viscosity water6disputed discuss ultramafic lavas younger proterozoic ultramafic magmas known phanerozoic modern komatiite lavas known earths mantle cooled much produce highly magnesian magmas
unusual lavas
lavas unusual composition erupted onto surface earth include

carbonatite natrocarbonatite lavas known doinyo lengai volcano tanzania sole example active carbonatite volcano7
iron oxide lavas thought source iron kiruna sweden formed proterozoic8 iron oxide lavas pliocene occur laco volcanic complex chileargentina border9 iron oxide lavas thought result immiscible separation iron oxide magma parental magma calcalkaline alkaline composition8
sulfur lava flows metres feet long metres feet wide occur lastarria volcano chile formed melting sulfur deposits temperatures
olivine nephelinite lavas thought come much deeper mantle earth lavas10

term lava also used refer molten mixtures eruptions satellites solar systems giants11 cryovolcanism
lava behavior




toes pāhoehoe advance across road kalapana east rift zone kīlauea volcano hawaii united states


general composition lava determines behavior temperature eruption viscosity lava important determines lava behave lavas high viscosity rhyolite dacite andesite trachyte cooled basaltic lava also quite viscous viscosities freshly erupted basalt carbonatite occasionally andesite
highly viscous lava shows following behaviors

tends flow slowly clog form semisolid blocks resist flow
tends entrap form vesicles bubbles within rock rise surface
correlates explosive phreatic eruptions associated tuff pyroclastic flowscitation needed

highly viscous lavas usually flow liquid usually form explosive fragmental tephra deposits however degassed viscous lava erupts somewhat hotter usual form lava flow
lava viscosity shows following behaviors

tends flow easily forming puddles channels rivers molten rock
tends easily release bubbling gases formed
eruptions rarely pyroclastic usually quiescent
volcanoes tend form broad shields rather steep cones

lavas also contain many components sometimes including solid crystals various minerals fragments exotic rocks known xenoliths fragments previously solidified lava

glowing ʻaʻā flow front advancing pāhoehoe coastal plain kilauea hawaii united states


ʻaʻā three basic types flow lava ʻaʻā basaltic lava characterized rough rubbly surface composed broken lava blocks called clinker hawaiian word introduced technical term geology clarence dutton12
loose broken sharp spiny surface ʻaʻā flow makes hiking difficult slow clinkery surface actually covers massive dense core active part flow pasty lava core travels downslope clinkers carried along surface leading edge ʻaʻā flow however cooled fragments tumble steep front buried advancing flow produces layer lava fragments bottom ʻaʻā flow
accretionary lava balls large metres feet common ʻaʻā flows ʻaʻā usually higher viscosity pāhoehoe pāhoehoe turn ʻaʻā becomes turbulent meeting impediments steep slopes
sharp angled texture makes ʻaʻā strong radar reflector easily seen orbiting satellite bright magellan pictures13
ʻaʻā lavas typically erupt temperatures 1000 1100 1830 2010
word also spelled ʻaʻa pronounced ˈɑːɑː ˈɑːʔɑː originates hawaiian pronounced ʔəˈʔaː14 meaning stony rough lava also burn blaze
pāhoehoe




pāhoehoe lava kīlauea volcano hawaii united states


pāhoehoe pəˈhoʊiːˈhoʊiː hawaiian paːˈhoweˈhowe15 meaning smooth unbroken lava also spelled pahoehoe basaltic lava smooth billowy undulating ropy surface surface features movement fluid lava congealing surface crust hawaiian word introduced technical term geology clarence dutton12
pāhoehoe flow typically advances series small lobes toes continually break cooled crust also forms lava tubes minimal heat loss maintains viscosity surface texture pāhoehoe flows varies widely displaying kinds bizarre shapes often referred lava sculpture increasing distance source pāhoehoe flows change ʻaʻā flows response heat loss consequent increase viscosity pahoehoe lavas typically temperature 1100 1200 2010 2190

hazards
lava flows enormously destructive property path however casualties rare since flows usually slow enough people animals escape though dependent viscosity lava nevertheless injuries deaths occurred either escape route close flow19 rarely lava flow front travels quickly notably happened eruption nyiragongo zaire democratic republic congo night january 1977 crater wall breached fluid lava lake drained hour resulting flow sped steep slopes overwhelmed several villages residents asleep result disaster mountain designated decade volcano 199120
deaths attributed volcanoes frequently different cause example volcanic ejecta pyroclastic flow collapsing lava dome lahars poisonous gases travel ahead lava explosions caused flow comes contact water19 particularly dangerous area called lava bench young ground typically breakoff fall
areas recent lava flows continue represent hazard long lava cooled young flows created lands land unstable breakoff flows often crack deeply forming dangerous chasms fall lava similar falling broken glass rugged hiking boots long pants gloves recommended crossing lava flows
