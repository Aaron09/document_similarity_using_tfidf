information wifi protected setup physical security issues
piggybacking refers access wireless internet connection bringing ones computer within range anothers wireless connection using service without subscribers explicit permission knowledge
early popular adoption 80211 providing open access points anyone within range encouragedby cultivate wireless community networks82 particularly since people average fraction downstream bandwidth given time
recreational logging mapping peoples access points become known wardriving indeed many access points intentionally installed without security turned used free service providing access ones internet connection fashion breach terms service contract activities result sanctions jurisdictions however legislation case differ considerably across world proposal leave graffiti describing available services called warchalking83 florida court case determined owner laziness valid excusecitation needed
