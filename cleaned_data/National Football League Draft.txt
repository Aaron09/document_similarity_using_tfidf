since 1977 also held supplemental draft accommodate players enter regular draft players generally enter supplementary draft missed filing deadline draft issues developed affected eligibility academic disciplinary matters supplemental draft scheduled occur point regular draft start next season 1984 held additional draft players contract either usfl teams
draft order determined weighted system divided three groupings first come teams fewer wins last season followed nonplayoff teams wins followed playoff teams supplemental draft team required picks instead team wants player supplemental draft submit commissioner round would pick player team places player earlier spot team awarded player give equivalent pick following years draft78 example paul oliver taken diego chargers fourth round supplemental draft 2007 thus 2008 draft chargers forfeited fourthround pick
1985 supplemental draft particularly controversial quarterback bernie kosar university miami first national championship 1984 earning academic degree junior rather finish eligibility miami wanted turn time college players wait class unless graduated early
plan devised football agent faigin79 kosars preferred team cleveland browns faigin representing former university miami kelly usfl whose rights held buffalo bills usfl last days kelly would soon available bills faigins first step bill polian buffalo would willing trade number supplemental pick worth next nothing time cleveland polian agreed faigin told cleveland browns trade available next notified kosars father formally submit sons application standard draft weeks away declare afterward would supplemental draft
result kosars withdrawal resulted rare open warfare among teams played newspapers threats lawsuits notably minnesota vikings york giants expressed interest choosing seasons regular draft rules broken giants eventually minnesota back following season instituted current semirandom supplemental draft order
strategy devised faigin declare regular draft subsequently used players various reasons cases want play team would drafted regular draft example brian bosworth declare want play indianapolis colts buffalo bills teams drafted second third year colts offered 4year million deal draft80 seattle seahawks right draft first supplemental draft later signed 10year million contract81 time largest rookie contract history
