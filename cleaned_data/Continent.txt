submerged continents
areas continental crust largely covered considered submerged continents notable examples zealandia emerging primarily zealand caledonia almost completely submerged kerguelen plateau southern indian ocean
microcontinents

botanical continents




botanical continents defined world geographical scheme recording plant distributions


continents defined differently specific purposes biodiversity information standards organization developed world geographical scheme recording plant distributions used many international plant databases scheme divides world nine botanical continents match traditional geographical continents differ significantly thus americas divided northern america mexico northwards southern america central america caribbean southwards rather north america south america40
