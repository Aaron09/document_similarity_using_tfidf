etymologyedit
term radio derived latin word radius meaning spoke wheel beam light first applied communications 1881 suggestion french scientist ernest mercadier alexander graham bell adopted radiophone meaning radiated sound alternate name photophone optical transmission system5 however invention would widely adopted
following heinrich hertzs establishment existence electromagnetic radiation late 1880s variety terms initially used phenomenon early descriptions radiation including hertzian waves electric waves ether waves phrases describing communications included spark telegraphy space telegraphy aerography eventually commonly wireless telegraphy however wireless included broad variety related electronic technologies including electrostatic induction electromagnetic induction aquatic earth conduction need precise term referring exclusively electromagnetic radiation
first radio conjunction electromagnetic radiation appears french physicist édouard branly 1890 developed version coherer receiver called radioconducteur6 radio prefix later used form additional descriptive compound hyphenated words especially europe example early 1898 british publication practical engineer included reference radiotelegraph radiotelegraphy7 french text 1903 1906 berlin radiotelegraphic conventions includes phrases radiotélégraphique radiotélégrammes
radio standalone word dates back least december 1904 instructions issued british post office transmitting telegrams specified word radio sent service instructions8 practice universally adopted word radio introduced internationally 1906 berlin radiotelegraphic convention included service regulation specifying radiotelegrams shall show preamble service radio
switch radio place wireless took place slowly unevenly englishspeaking world forest helped popularize word united states—in early 1907 founded deforest radio telephone company letter june 1907 electrical world need legal restrictions warned radio chaos certainly result stringent regulation enforced9 united states navy would also play role although translation 1906 berlin convention used terms wireless telegraph wireless telegram 1912 began promote radio instead term started become preferred general public 1920s introduction broadcasting broadcasting based upon agricultural term meaning roughly scattering seeds widely british commonwealth countries continued commonly term wireless mid20th century though magazine british broadcasting corporation called radio times since founding early 1920s
recent years general term wireless gained renewed popularity even devices using electromagnetic radiation rapid growth shortrange computer networking wireless local area network wlan wifi bluetooth well mobile telephony umts cell phones today term radio specifies transceiver device chip whereas wireless refers lack physical connections thus equipment employs embedded radio transceivers operates wireless devices wireless sensor networks
