another technical approach occams razor ontological parsimony26 parsimony means spareness also referred rule simplicity considered strong version ockhams razor2728 variation used medicine called zebra doctor reject exotic medical diagnosis commonplace explanation likely derived theodore woodwards dictum hear hoofbeats think horses zebras29
ernst mach formulated stronger version ockhams razor physics called principle economy stating scientists must simplest means arriving results exclude everything perceived senses30
principle goes back least aristotle wrote nature operates shortest possible27 idea parsimony simplicity deciding theories though intent original expression ockhams razor assimilated culture widespread laymans formulation simplest explanation usually correct one27
justificationsedit
aestheticedit
prior 20th century commonly held belief nature simple simpler hypotheses nature thus likely true notion deeply rooted aesthetic value simplicity holds human thought justifications presented often drew theology thomas aquinas made argument 13th century writing thing done adequately means superfluous means several observe nature employ instruments suffices31
beginning 20th century epistemological justifications based induction logic pragmatism especially probability theory become popular among philosopherswho

occams razor gained strong empirical support helping converge better theories applications section examples
related concept overfitting excessively complex models affected statistical noise problem also known biasvariance tradeoff whereas simpler models capture underlying structure better thus better predictive performance however often difficult deduce part data noise model selection test minimum description length bayesian inference
testing razoredit
razors statement things equal simpler explanations generally better complex ones amenable empirical testing another interpretation razors statement would simpler hypotheses generally better complex ones procedure test former interpretation would compare track records simple comparatively complex explanations accepts first interpretation validity occams razor tool would rejected complex explanations often correct less complex ones converse would lend support latter interpretation accepted validity occams razor tool could possibly accepted simpler hypotheses correct conclusions often




possible explanations become needlessly complex coherent instance involvement leprechauns explanation occams razor would prevent additions unless necessary


increases complexity sometimes necessary remains justified general bias toward simpler competing explanations understand consider accepted explanation phenomenon always infinite number possible complex ultimately incorrect alternatives always burden failing explanation hypothesis hypotheses justifications prevent theories falsified even empirical criteria consilience never truly eliminate explanations competition true explanation many alternatives simpler false also infinite number alternatives complex false alternative hypothesis indeed justifiable implicit conclusions would empirically verifiable commonly accepted repeatability principle alternative theories never observed continue escape observationclarification needed addition explanation true withstood principle
another even complex theory still possibly true example individual makes supernatural claims leprechauns responsible breaking vase simpler explanation would mistaken ongoing justifications thats film tampered successfully prevent outright falsification endless supply elaborate competing explanations called saving hypotheses cannot ruled out—except using occams razor323334 study predictive validity occam’s razor found published papers included comparisons economic forecasts simple complex forecasting methods none papers provided balance evidence complexity method improved forecast accuracy papers quantitative comparisons complexity increased forecast errors average percent35

karl popperedit
karl popper argues preference simple theories need appeal practical aesthetic considerations preference simplicity justified falsifiability criterion prefer simpler theories complex ones empirical content greater better testable popper 1992 idea simple theory applies cases complex thus easily falsifiable comparing simple theory complex theory explain data equally well
elliott soberedit
philosopher science elliott sober argued along lines popper tying simplicity informativeness simplest theory informative sense requires less information question38 since rejected account simplicity purportedly fails provide epistemic justification simplicity believes simplicity considerations considerations parsimony particular count unless reflect something fundamental philosophers suggests made error hypostatizing simplicity endowed generis existence meaning embedded specific context sober 1992 fail justify simplicity considerations basis context noncircular justification question rational noncircular answer true question simplicity considered evaluating plausibility hypotheses39

scientific method parsimony epistemological metaphysical heuristic preference irrefutable principle logic scientific result3447 logical principle occams razor would demand scientists accept simplest possible theoretical explanation existing data however science shown repeatedly future data often support complex theories existing data science prefers simplest explanation consistent data available given time simplest explanation ruled data become available14 science open possibility future experiments might support complex theories demanded current data interested designing experiments discriminate competing theories favoring theory another based merely philosophical principles345
