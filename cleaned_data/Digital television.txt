historyedit
digital roots tied closely availability inexpensive high performance computers wasnt 1990s digital became real possibility7
mid1980s japanese consumer electronics firms forged ahead development hdtv technology muse analog format proposed japanese company japanese advancements seen pacesetters threatened eclipse electronics companies june 1990 japanese muse standard—based analog system—was frontrunner among different technical concepts consideration american company general instrument demonstrated feasibility digital television signal breakthrough significance persuaded delay decision standard digitally based standard could developed
march 1990 became clear digital standard feasible made number critical decisions first commission declared standard must enhanced analog signal able provide genuine hdtv signal least twice resolution existing television images ensure viewers wish digital television could continue receive conventional television broadcasts dictated standard must capable simulcast different channels standard also allowed signal based entirely design principles although incompatible existing ntsc standard standard would able incorporate many improvements7
final standard adopted require single standard scanning formats aspect ratios lines resolution outcome resulted dispute consumer electronics industry joined broadcasters computer industry joined film industry public interest groups scanning processes—interlaced progressive—is superior interlaced scanning used televisions worldwide scans evennumbered lines first oddnumbered ones progressive scanning format used computers scans lines sequences bottom computer industry argued progressive scanning superior flicker manner interlaced scanning also argued progressive scanning enables easier connections internet cheaply converted interlaced formats vice versa film industry also supported progressive scanning offers efficient means converting filmed programming digital formats part consumer electronics industry broadcasters argued interlaced scanning technology could transmit highest quality pictures currently feasible 1080 lines picture 1920 pixels line broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning vast archive interlaced programming readily compatible progressive format7

comparison image quality isdbt ntsc bottom


digital television supports many different picture formats defined broadcast television systems combination size aspect ratio width height ratio
digital terrestrial television broadcasting range formats broadly divided categories high definition television hdtv transmission highdefinition video standarddefinition television sdtv terms precise many subtle intermediate cases exist
several different hdtv formats transmitted 1280 pixels progressive scan mode abbreviated 720p 1920 1080 pixels interlaced video mode 1080i uses aspect ratio hdtv cannot transmitted analog television channels channel capacity issues
sdtv comparison several different formats taking form various aspect ratios depending technology used country broadcast terms rectangular pixels ntsc countries deliver resolution give 1024 however broadcasters choose reduce resolutions reduce rate many dvbt channels united kingdom horizontal resolution pixels line8
commercial broadcasting terrestrial television channel north america permitted broadcast rate megabits second however broadcaster need entire bandwidth broadcast channel instead broadcast channel include psip also subdivide across several video subchannels feeds varying quality compression rates including nonvideo datacasting services allow oneway highbitrate streaming data computers like national datacast
broadcaster standarddefinition sdtv digital signal instead hdtv signal current convention allows bandwidth channel multiplex subdivided multiple digital subchannels similar radio stations offer radio providing multiple feeds entirely different television programming channel ability provide either single hdtv feed multiple lowerresolution feeds often referred distributing ones budget multicasting sometimes arranged automatically using statistical multiplexer statmux implementations image resolution less directly limited bandwidth example dvbt broadcasters choose several different modulation schemes giving option reduce transmission rate make reception easier distant mobile viewers
receiving digital signaledit
several different ways receive digital television oldest means receiving general terrestrial transmitters using antenna known aerial countries known digital terrestrial television viewers limited channels terrestrial transmitter range antenna
ways devised receive digital television among familiar people digital cable digital satellite countries transmissions signals normally achieved microwaves digital mmds used standards digital multimedia broadcasting dvbh devised allow handheld devices mobile phones receive signals another iptv receiving internet protocol relying digital subscriber line optical cable line finally alternative receive digital signals open internet internet television whether central streaming service peertopeer system
signals carry encryption specify conditions recorded viewed displays larger diagonal measure backed force world intellectual property organization copyright treaty wipo copyright treaty national legislation implementing digital millennium copyright access encrypted channels controlled removable smart card example common interface dvbci standard europe point deployment named differently cablecard

comparison analog digitaledit
also analog television
several advantages analog significant digital channels take less bandwidth bandwidth needs continuously variable corresponding reduction image quality depending level compression well resolution transmitted image means digital broadcasters provide digital channels space provide highdefinition television service provide nontelevision services multimedia interactivity also permits special services multiplexing program channel electronic program guides additional languages spoken subtitled sale nontelevision services provide additional revenue source
digital analog signals react interference differently example common problems analog television include ghosting images noise weak signals many potential problems degrade quality image sound although program material still watchable digital television audio video must synchronized digitally reception digital signal must nearly complete otherwise neither audio video usable short complete failure blocky video seen digital signal experiences interference
analog started monophonic sound later evolved stereophonic sound independent audio signal channels allow audio signal channels plus subwoofer bass channel broadcasts similar quality movie theaters dvds12
compression artifacts picture quality monitoring allocated bandwidthedit
images picture defects present analog television motion picture cinema presentday limitations rate compression algorithms mpeg2 defect sometimes referred mosquito noise13
human visual system works defects image localized particular features image come perceptible defects uniform constant however system designed take advantage limitations human visual system help mask flaws allowing compression artifacts fast motion cannot track resolve easily conversely minimizing artifacts still backgrounds closely examined scene since time allows
broadcast cable satellite internet operators control picture quality television signal encodes using sophisticated neurosciencebased algorithms structural similarity ssim video quality measurement tool accorded inventors primetime emmy global another tool called visual information fidelity topperforming algorithm core netflix vmaf video quality monitoring system accounts bandwidth consumption
effects poor receptionedit
changes signal reception factors degrading antenna connections changing weather conditions gradually reduce quality analog nature digital results perfectly decodable video initially receiving equipment starts picking interference overpowers desired signal signal weak decode equipment show garbled picture significant damage devices directly perfectly decodable video video lock phenomenon known digital cliff effect
remote locations distant channels analog signals previously usable snowy degraded state digital signals perfectly decodable become completely unavailable higher frequencies problems especially cases clear lineofsight receiving antenna transmitter available
