information retrievaledit
main article information retrieval
information retrieval area study concerned searching documents information within documents metadata documents well searching structured storage relational databases world wide automated information retrieval systems used reduce called information overload many universities public libraries systems provide access books journals documents search engines visible applications
information retrieval process begins user enters query system queries formal statements information needs example search strings search engines information retrieval query uniquely identify single object collection instead several objects match query perhaps different degrees relevancy
object entity represented information database user queries matched database information depending application data objects example text documents images32 audio33 mind maps34 videos often documents kept stored directly system instead represented system document surrogates metadata
systems compute numeric score well object database match query rank objects according value ranking objects shown user process iterated user wishes refine query35
