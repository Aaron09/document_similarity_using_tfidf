first recorded historical optical disc 1884 alexander graham bell chichester bell charles sumner tainter recorded sound glass disc using beam light5
early optical disc system existed 1935 named lichttonorgelcitation needed
early analog optical disc used video recording invented david paul gregg 19586 patented 1961 1969 form optical disc early form patent 3430966 special interest patent 4893297 filed 1989 issued 1990 generated royalty income pioneer corporations 2007 —then encompassing bluray systems early 1960s music corporation america bought greggs patents company gauss electrophysics
american inventor james russell credited inventing first system record digital signal optical transparent foil behind highpower halogen lamp russells patent application first filed 1966 granted patent 1970 following litigation sony philips licensed russells patents held canadian company optical recording corp 1980s789
greggs russells disc floppy media read transparent mode impose serious drawbacks netherlands 1969 philips research physicist pieter kramer invented optical videodisc reflective mode protective layer read focused laser beam patent 5068846 filed 1972 issued 1991 kramers physical format used optical discs 1975 philips began work together 1978 commercially much late presented longawaited laserdisc atlanta delivered discs philips players however presentation commercial failure cooperation ended
japan pioneer succeeded videodisc advent 1979 philips sony consortium successfully developed audio compact disc
1979 exxon star systems pasadena built computer controlled worm drive utilized thin film coatings tellerium selenium diameter glass disk recording system utilized blue light 457nm record light 6328nm read star systems bought storage technology corporation 1981 moved boulderco development worm technology continued using diameter aluminum substrates beta testing disk drives originally labeled laser storage drive 2000 lsd2000 moderately successful many disks shipped laboratories david sarnoff research center used library congress archiving efforts disks utilized sealed cartridge optical window protection patent 4542495
late 1980s early 1990s optex rockville built erasable optical digital video disc system patent 5113387 using electron trapping optical media etomus patent 5128849 although technology written video magazines december 1994 issue promising death tape never marketed
mid1990s consortium manufacturers developed second generation optical disc dvd10
magnetic disks found limited applications storing data large amount need finding data storing techniques result found using optical means large data storing devices made turn gave rise optical discsthe first application kind compact disc used audio systems
sony philips developed first generation 1980s complete specifications devices help kind technology possibility representing analog signal digital signal exploited great level purpose samples analog signal taken rate 44100 samples second sample rate based nyquist rate 40000 samples second required capture audible frequency range without aliasing additional tolerance allow lessthanperfect analog audio prefilters remove higher frequencies11 first version standard allowed minutes music required 650mb storage
disc appeared cdrom become widespread society
third generation optical disc developed 2000–2006 introduced bluray disc first movies bluray discs released june 200612 bluray eventually prevailed high definition optical disc format competing format standard bluray disc hold data
