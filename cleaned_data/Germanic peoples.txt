historical records germanic tribes germania east rhine west danube begin quite late ancient period period examined clear germanic idea warfare quite different pitched battles fought rome greece instead germanic tribes focused raids warfare varying size however distinctive feature barbarian culture159
purpose generally gain territory rather capture resources secure prestige raids conducted irregular troops often formed along family village lines groups 1000 leaders unusual personal magnetism could gather soldiers longer periods systematic method gathering training death charismatic leader could mean destruction army armies also often consisted percent noncombatants displaced people would travel large groups soldiers elderly women children leaders able secure ample booty retainers able grow accordingly attracting warrior bands nearby villages159

analysis germanic tactics versus roman empire roman infantry versus gallic germanic tribes
weaponry
weapons used germanic tribes varied used axes throwing javelins spears bows arrows along swords swords used germanic warriors captured roman soldiers century german blacksmiths began making best steel europe165 body armor rarely worn light comparison romans employed leaders wore helmets battlefield166 commandeering roman weaponry widespread acquisition superior roman armaments allowed germanic leaders exert power ways previously available also meant fierce intergermanic rivalry constituted larger power blocks germanic world167 much like predecessors vikings used axes swords long knives spears oblong shields leather metal helmets mail leather coats protection latter luxuries could afford168
tactics
greatest extent germanic fighting units consisted infantry would emerge cover attack also utilized skilled cavalrymen times something visigoths used decisively victory adrianople cavalry warfare limited northern europe lack suitably large horses mounted troops caesar provided germanic armies roman mounts enable greater mobility enhance fighting efficiency169 unlike western celtic neighbors chariots picked early germans170 notwithstanding occasional fortified position germanic warriors preferred fight open normally assumed offensive rather fight defensively171 emboldening fierce attacks germanic warriors would rouse highpitched level excitement charge headlong enemies effective ambush operations lacked terms organizational skill needed prolonged siege warfare172 berserker mentality employed germanic tribes rome still effect viking centuries believed summoning gods working would possess superhuman strength protected battle resolution believe dying manner heroic would transport fallen fighter straight valhalla would embraced warrior maidens known valkyries172r later military development armored knights fortified castles response part relentless plundering raiding vikings meant germanic tribes settled mainland europe british isles adapt combat another germanic tribe interlopers173
economy
traces earliest pastoralism germanic peoples appear central europe form elaborate cattle burials along elbe vistula rivers around 4000–3000 bce174 archaeological remnants left globular amphora culture cleared forests herding cattle sometime 3000 began using wheeled carts plows cultivate lands central survival assistance tilling soil supplying food cattle became economic resource early people175 germanic settlements typically small rarely containing much households often less usually located clearings woodss settlements remained fairly constant size throughout period buildings villages varied form normally consisted farmhouses surrounded smaller buildings granaries storage rooms universal building material timber cattle humans usually lived together house

widening trade germanic tribes rome started later following empires wars conquest looked germanic people supply slaves leather quality iron reasons romans drawn borders along rhine besides sizable population germanic warriors side germanic economy robust enough extract much booty convinced could acquire sufficient revenue additional efforts conquest drawing distinctive line germanic people also incentivized alliances trade germanic people sought share imperial wealth181 roman coinage coveted germanic people preferred silver gold coins mostly likely indications market economy developing tacitus mention presence bartering system observable among germanic people exclusive also writes gold silver purpose commerce adding rather sardonically text exchanged nothing petty merchandise70 observations tacitus aside fine metalwork iron glassware soon traded germanic peoples along coast north denmark netherlands182
kinship patterns
writings tacitus allude germanic peoples aware shared ethnicity either knew believed shared common biological ancestor another pervasive awareness certainly debatable factors like language clothing ornamentation hair styles weapon types religious practices shared oral history likely significant tribal identity germanics183 members germanic tribe told tales exploits heroic founding figures less mythologized village life consisted free assembled chieftain shared common cultural political traditions status among early germanic tribes often gauged size mans cattle herd ones martial prowess184
conversion christianity germanic peoples europe made several tribes functioning economic military unit sometimes united common religious cult kinship especially close kinship important life within tribe generally source tribes identity fact several elements ancient germanic life tended weaken role kinship importance retinues surrounding military chieftains ability strong leaders unite people closely related feuds conflicts within tribe might lead permanent divisions retinue often called comitatus scholars following practice ancient roman writers consisted followers chieftain depended retinue military services return provided retinues needs divided spoils battle185 relationship chieftain followers became basis complicated feudal system developed medieval europe chieftains retinue might include close relatives limited eventually rising power individual chieftains kings among military leadership germanic tribes confederations curtailed many ways replaced power enjoyed tribal assemblies186 code ethics battle prevailed among germanic according tacitus greatest disgrace befall warrior clan among germanic tribes abandonment shield combat almost certainly resulted social isolation187 within tribal germanic society social hierarchy linked intrinsically warrior code maintained fidelity chiefs young warriors188
feuds standard means resolving conflicts regulating behavior peace within tribe controlling violence codes identifying exactly certain types feuds settled183 closely related person injured killed supposed exact revenge monetary payment offender duty helped reaffirm bonds extended family members feuds weakened tribe whole sometimes leading creation tribe group separated rest clans germanic people consisted groupings households total societal rules specific clan189 recent scholarship suggests despite obligation take part feuds customs involving kinship ties extended families form independent units among early germanic peoples though members tribe would less distantly related common descent main source tribes identity extended families main social units within tribe traditional theories emphasized supposedly central role germanic culture clans large groups common ancestry little evidence clans existed certainly important element social organization historian alexander murray concludes kinship crucial factor aspects barbarian activity uses groupings fluid probably whole long lasting190 internal competition within factions tribe occasionally resulted internecine warfare weakened sometime destroyed group appears case cherusci tribe romes earlier period191
important family relationships among early germanic peoples within individual household fact based archaeological evidence settlements longhouses appeared central existence within household unit individual equally bound mother fathers side family192 fathers main figures authority189 wives also played important respected role germanic tribes even believed women possessed magical powers feared accordingly193 tacitus describes battles germanic warriors encouraged cared wives mothers also notes times peace women work managing household along children apparently household chores well children valued according tacitus limiting destroying ones offspring considered shameful mothers apparently breastfed children rather using nurses besides parents children household might include slaves slavery uncommon according tacitus slaves normally households slaves usually prisoners often employed domestic servants189 polygamy concubinage rare existed least among upper classest certain number families resided territory constituted village dorf german overall territory occupied people tribe designated writings tacitus civitas individual civitas divided pagi cantons made several vici cases tribes grouped larger confederations group kingdoms term pagus applied german194 extensive contact rome altered egalitarian structure tribal germanic society individuals rose prominence distinction commoner nobility developed previous constructs folkright shared equally across tribe replaced cases privilege165 result germanic society became stratified elites within germanic tribes learned roman system emulated established dominion able gain advantages exploit accordingly195
important changes began taking place century germanic peoples still cognizant unique clan identities started forming larger confederations similar culture gathering around dominant tribes among hearkening charismatic leaders brought various barbarians tribes closer together surface change appeared romans welcome since preferred deal strong chiefs control populations feared across rhine danube eventually made germanic rulers confederated peoples powerful196 strong still federated another since possessed sense pangermanic solidarity started change noticeably century romes expense197
marriage
