submarine simply watercraft capable independent operation underwater differs submersible limited underwater capability term commonly refers large crewed vessel also sometimes used historically colloquially refer remotely operated vehicles robots well mediumsized smaller vessels midget submarine noun submarine evolved shortened form submarine boat1 naval tradition submarines usually referred boats rather ships regardless size boat usually reserved seagoing vessels relatively small size
although experimental submarines built submarine design took 19th century adopted several navies submarines first widely used world 1914–1918 figure many navies large small military uses include attacking enemy surface ships merchant military attacking submarines aircraft carrier protection blockade running ballistic missile submarines part nuclear strike force reconnaissance conventional land attack example using cruise missile covert insertion special forces civilian uses submarines include marine science salvage exploration facility inspection maintenance submarines also modified perform specialized functions searchandrescue missions undersea cable repair submarines also used tourism undersea archaeology
large submarines consist cylindrical body hemispherical conical ends vertical structure usually located amidships houses communications sensing devices well periscopes modern submarines structure sail american usage european usage conning tower feature earlier designs separate pressure hull main body boat allowed shorter periscopes propeller pump rear various hydrodynamic control fins smaller deepdiving specialty submarines deviate significantly traditional layout submarines diving planes also change amount water ballast tanks change buoyancy submerging surfacing
