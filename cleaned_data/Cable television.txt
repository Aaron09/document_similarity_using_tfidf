details topic cable television united states
cable television began united states commercial business 1950 although smallscale systems hobbyists 1940s
early systems simply received weak broadcast channels amplified sent unshielded wires subscribers limited community adjacent communities receiving antenna would higher individual subscriber could afford thus bringing stronger signals hilly mountainous terrain would placed high elevation
outset cable systems served smaller communities without television stations could easily receive signals stations cities distance hilly terrain canada however communities signals fertile cable markets viewers wanted receive american signals rarely college town alfred york cable systems retransmitted canadian channels
although early television receivers could receive channels maximum number channels could broadcast city channels either receivers time unable receive strong local signals adjacent channels without distortion frequency gaps allowed used city
equipment improved twelve channels could utilized except local television station broadcast local broadcast channels usable signals deemed priority technology allowed lowpriority signals placed channels synchronizing blanking intervals similarly local station could carried broadcast channel signals would arrive slightly separated time causing ghostingcitation needed
bandwidth amplifiers also limited meaning frequencies difficult transmit distant portions coaxial network channels could used expand beyond channels nonstandard midband channels used located band channel superband beyond channel channels initially accessible using separate tuner boxes sent chosen channel channel 4citation needed
added cable midband channels used early incarnations channel angeles transmitted clear scrambled standard sets period could pick signal could average consumer detune normal stations able receive
tuners could receive select midband superband channels began incorporated standard television sets broadcasters forced either install scrambling circuitry move signals range reception early cableready vcrs however allocated cable channelswhich incorporated premium broadcasters left choice scramble
unfortunately paytv operators descrambling circuitry often published electronics hobby magazines popular science popular electronics allowing anybody anything rudimentary knowledge broadcast electronics able build receive programming without cost
later cable operators began carry radio stations encouraged subscribers connect stereo sets cable stereo bilingual sound became common paytv channel sound added stereo cable lineups time operators expanded beyond 12channel dial midband superband channels adjacent high band north american television frequencies operators cornwall ontario used dual distribution network channels cables
1980s united states regulations unlike public educational government access created beginning cableoriginated live television programming cable penetration increased numerous cableonly stations launched many news bureaus could provide immediate localized content provided nearest network newscast

evolved todays many cableonly broadcasts diverse programming including cableonly produced television movies miniseries cable specialty channels starting channels oriented show movies large sporting performance events diversified narrowcasting became common late 1980s cableonly signals outnumbered broadcast signals cable systems time expanded beyond channels mid1980s canada cable operators allowed regulator enter distribution contracts cable networks
1990s tiers became common customers able subscribe different tiers obtain different selections additional channels basic selection subscribing additional tiers customers could specialty channels movie channels foreign channels large cable companies used addressable descramblers limit access premium channels customers subscribing higher tiers however magazines often published workarounds technology well
1990s pressure accommodate growing array offerings resulted digital transmission made efficient signal capacity fibre optics common carry signals areas near home coax could carry higher frequencies short remaining distance although time 1980s 1990s television receivers vcrs equipped receive midband superband channels fact descrambling circuitry time present tuners depriving cable operator much revenue cableready tuners rarely used requiring return settop boxes used 1970s onward
