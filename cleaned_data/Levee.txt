etymologyedit
speakers american english notably midwest deep south word levee french word levée feminine past participle french verb lever raise originated orleans years citys founding 1718 later adopted english speakers4need quotation verify name derives trait levees ridges raised higher channel surrounding floodplains
modern word dike dyke likely derives dutch word dijk construction dikes frisia part netherlands germany well attested early 11th century kilometres long westfriese omringdijk completed 1250 formed connecting existing older dikes roman chronicler tacitus mentions rebellious batavi pierced dikes flood land protect retreat word dijk originally indicated trench bank closely parallels english verb dig6
anglosaxon word already existed pronounced dick northern england ditch south similar dutch english origins word digging trench forming upcast soil bank alongside practice meant name given either excavation bank thus offas dyke combined structure dyke trench though raised banks well midlands north england united states dike ditch south propertyboundary marker small drainagechannel carries stream called running dike rippingale running dike leads water catchwater drain dyke south forty foot drain lincolnshire tf1427 weir dike soak dike bourne north near twenty alongside river glen lincolnshire norfolk suffolk broads dyke drainage ditch narrow artificial channel river broad access mooring longer dykes named candle dyke7
parts britain particularly scotland dyke field wall generally made stone

reinforced embankment


main purpose artificial levees prevent flooding adjoining countryside slow natural course changes waterway provide reliable shipping lanes maritime commerce time also confine flow river resulting higher faster water flow levees mainly found along dunes strong enough along rivers protection highfloods along lakes along polders furthermore levees built purpose empoldering boundary inundation area latter controlled inundation military measure prevent inundation larger area surrounded levees levees also built field boundaries military defences type levee found article drystone walls
levees permanent earthworks emergency constructions often sandbags built hastily flood emergency emergency bank added existing levee known cradge
earliest levees constructed indus valley civilization pakistan north india circa 2600 agrarian life harappan peoples depended8 levees also constructed 3000 years ancient egypt system levees built along left bank river nile miles stretching modern aswan nile delta shores mediterranean mesopotamian civilizations ancient china also built large levee systems9 levee strong weakest point height standards construction consistent along length authorities argued requires strong governing authority guide work catalyst development systems governance early civilizations however others point evidence large scale watercontrol earthen works canals andor levees dating king scorpion predynastic egypt governance less centralized

united states army corps engineers usace recommends supports cellular confinement technology geocells best management practice11 particular attention given matter surface erosion overtopping prevention protection levee crest downstream slope reinforcement geocells provides tensile force soil better resist instability
artificial levees lead elevation natural river time whether happens fast depends different factors amount type load river alluvial rivers intense accumulations sediment tend behavior examples rivers artificial levees elevation river even point river higher adjacent ground surface behind levees found yellow river china mississippi
coastal flood preventionedit
levees common marshlands bordering fundy brunswick nova scotia canada acadians settled area credited original construction many levees area created purpose farming fertile tidal marshlands levees referred dykes constructed hinged sluice gates open falling tide drain freshwater agricultural marshlands close rising tide prevent seawater entering behind dyke sluice gates called aboiteaux lower mainland around city vancouver british columbia levees known locally dikes also referred wall protect lowlying land fraser river delta particularly city richmond lulu island also dikes protect locations flooded past pitt polder land adjacent pitt river tributary rivers
coastal flood prevention levees also common along inland coastline behind wadden area devastated many historic floods12 thus peoples governments erected increasingly large complex flood protection levee systems stop even storm floods biggest course huge levees netherlands gone beyond defending floods aggressively taken back land mean level13
spur dykes groynesedit
also jetty breakwater structure
typically manmade hydraulic structures situated protect erosion typically placed alluvial rivers perpendicular angle bank channel revetment14 used widely along coastlines common types spur dyke permeable impermeable depending materials used construct
natural examplesedit
natural levees commonly form around lowland rivers creeks without human intervention elongate ridges andor silt form river floodplains immediately adjacent banks like artificial levees reduce likelihood floodplain inundation
deposition levees natural consequence flooding meandering rivers carry high proportions suspended sediment form fine sands silts muds carrying capacity river depends part depth sediment water flooded banks channel longer capable keeping amount fine sediments suspension main thalweg extra fine sediments thus settle quickly parts floodplain nearest channel significant number floods eventually result building ridges positions reducing likelihood floods episodes levee building
aggradation continues occur main channel make levee overtopping likely levees continue build cases result channel eventually rising surrounding floodplains penned levees around example yellow river china near oceangoing ships appear sail high plain elevated river
levees common river high suspended sediment fraction thus intimately associated meandering channels also likely occur river carries large fractions suspended sediment similar reasons also common tidal creeks tides bring large amounts coastal silts muds high spring tides cause flooding result building levees
failures breachesedit
main article levee breach
natural manmade levees fail number ways factors cause levee failure include overtopping erosion structural failures levee saturation frequent dangerous levee breach part levee actually breaks eroded away leaving large opening water flood land otherwise protected levee breach sudden gradual failure caused either surface erosion subsurface weakness levee breach leave fanshaped deposit sediment radiating away breach described crevasse splay natural levees breach occurred levee remain filled levee building processes increases chances future breaches occurring location breaches location meander cutoffs river flow direction permanently diverted
sometimes levees said fail water overtops crest levee cause flooding floodplains damage levee fewer consequences future flooding
among various failure mechanisms cause levee breaches soil erosion found important factors predicting soil erosion scour generation overtopping happens important order design stable levee floodwalls numerous studies investigate erodibility soils briaud 2008 used erosion function apparatus test measure erodibility soils afterwards using chen software numerical simulations performed levee find velocity vectors overtopping water generated scour overtopping water impinges levee analyzing results test erosion chart categorize erodibility soils developed hughes nadal 2009 studied effect combination wave overtopping storm surge overflow erosion scour generation levees study included hydraulic parameters flow characteristics flow thickness wave intervals surge level levee crown analyzing scour development according laboratory tests empirical correlations related average overtopping discharge derived analyze resistance levee erosion equations could situation similar experimental tests give reasonable estimation applied conditions
