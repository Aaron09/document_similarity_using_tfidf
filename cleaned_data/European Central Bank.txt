independenceedit
practice ecbs independence pinned four principles47

political independence community institutions bodies governments member states seek influence members decisionmaking bodies ncbs performance tasks symmetrically institutions national governments bound treaties respect ecbs independence
operational legal independence required competences achieve price stability mandate thereby steer monetary policy full autonomy means high level discretion ecbs governing council deliberates high degree secrecy since individual voting records disclosed public leading suspicions governing council members voting along national lines4849 addition monetary policy decisions right issue legally binding regulations within competence conditions laid union fulfilled sanction noncompliant actors violate legal requirements laid directly applicable union regulations ecbs legal personality also allows enter international legal agreements independently institutions party legal proceedings finally organise internal structure sees
personal independence mandate board members purposefully long years governors national central banks minimum renewable term office five years45 addition board members vastly immune judicial proceedings50 indeed removals office decided court justice european union cjeu request ecbs governing council executive board decision possible event incapacity serious misconduct national governors eurosystem national central banks dismissed national possibility appeal case longer fulfil functions guilty serious misconduct
financial independence body within whose statute guarantees budgetary independence resources income uses profits generated monetary policy operations cannot technically insolvent ecbs financial independence reinforces political independence require external financing symmetrically prohibited direct financing public institutions shields potential pressure public authorities

transparencyedit
addition independence subject limited transparency obligations contrast institutions standards major central banks indeed pointed transparency international treaties establish transparency openness principles institutions however grant partial exemption principles according tfeu bound eu’s transparency principles “only exercising administrative tasks” exemption leaves term “administrative tasks” undefined equally applies court justice european union european investment bank51
practice several concrete examples less transparent institutions

voting secrecy central banks publish voting record decision makers ecbs governing council decisions made full discretion since 2014 however publishes accounts monetary policy meetings52 remain rather vague include individual votes
access documents obligation bodies make documents freely accessible 30year embargo applies however ecb’s rules procedure governing council decide keep individual documents classified beyond 30year period
disclosure securities less transparent comes disclosing list securities held balance sheet monetary policy operations qe53

ecbs democratic accountabilityedit
return high degree independence discretion accountable european parliament lesser extent european court auditors european ombudsman court justice cjeu practice accountability involves five main mechanisms

annual report bound publish reports activities address annual report european parliament european commission council european union european council54 return european parliament evaluates past activities annual report european central bank essentially legallybinding list resolutions
quarterly hearings economic monetary affairs committee european parliament organises hearing monetary dialogue every quarter55 allowing members parliament address oral questions president
