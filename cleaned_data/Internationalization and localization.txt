internationalization localization process
based chart lisa website


according software without frontiers design aspects consider internationalizing product data encoding data documentation software construction hardware device support user interaction design areas consider making fully internationalized product scratch user interaction algorithm design data formats software services documentation1
translation typically timeconsuming component language localization1 involve

film video audio translation spoken words music lyrics often using either dubbing subtitles
text translation printed materials digital media possibly including error messages documentation
potentially altering images logos containing text contain translations generic icons1
different translation length differences character sizes latin alphabet letters chinese characters cause layouts work well language work poorly others1
consideration differences dialect register variety1
writing conventions like

formatting numbers especially decimal separator digit grouping
date time format possibly including different calendars



standard locale dataedit
computer software encounter differences beyond straightforward translation words phrases computer programs generate content dynamically differences need taken account internationalization process preparation translation many differences regular conversion languages easily automated common locale data repository unicode provides collection differences data used major operating systems including microsoft windows macos debian major internet companies projects google wikimedia foundation examples differences include

different scripts different writing systems different characters different letters syllograms logograms symbols modern system unicode standard represent many different languages single character encoding
writing direction left right european languages righttoleft hebrew arabic boustrophedon scripts optionally vertical asian languages1
complex text layout languages characters change shape depending context
capitalization exists scripts others
different languages writing systems different text sorting rules
different languages different numeral systems might need supported western arabic numerals used
different languages different pluralization rules complicate programs dynamically display numerical content9 grammar rules might also vary genitive
different languages different punctuation quoting text using doublequotes english guillemets french
keyboard shortcuts make buttons actually keyboard layout localized shortcut corresponds word particular language ctrls stands save english need changed10

national conventionsedit
different countries different economic conventions including variations

paper sizes
broadcast television systems popular storage media
telephone number format
postal address format postal codes choice delivery services
currency symbols positions currency markers reasonable amounts different inflation history 4217 codes often used internationalization
system measurement
battery sizes
voltage current standards

particular united states europe differ cases areas often follow
specific thirdparty services online maps weather reports payment service providers might available worldwide carriers
time zones vary across world must taken account product originally interacted people single time zone internationalization often used internally converted local time zone display purposes
different countries different legal requirements meaning example

regulatory compliance require customization particular jurisdiction change product whole

privacy compliance
additional disclaimers site packaging
different consumer labelling requirements
compliance export restrictions regulations encryption
compliance internet censorship regime subpoena procedures
requirements accessibility
collecting different taxes sales value added customs duties
sensitivity different political issues like geographical naming disputes disputed borders shown maps failing show kashmir indian crime indiacitation needed


government assigned numbers different formats passports social security number national identification numbers

localization also take account differences culture

local holidays
personal name title conventions
aesthetics
comprehensibility cultural appropriateness images color symbolism
ethnicity clothing socioeconomic status people architecture locations pictured
local customs conventions social taboos popular local religions superstitions blood types japanese culture astrological sign cultures

business process internationalizing softwareedit
order internationalize product important look variety markets product foreseeably enter1
details field length street addresses unique format address ability make postal code field optional address countries postal codes state field countries states plus introduction registration flows adhere local laws examples make internationalization complex project1112
broader approach takes account cultural factors regarding example adaptation business process logic inclusion individual cultural behavioral aspects113
already 1990s companies bull used machine translation systran large scale translation activity human translators handled preediting making input machinereadable postediting1
engineeringedit
reengineering existing software designing internationalized software first step internationalization split potentially localedependent part whether code text data separate module1 module either rely standard librarydependency independently replaced needed locale
current prevailing practice applications place text resource strings loaded program execution needed1 strings stored resource files relatively easy translate programs often built reference resource libraries depending selected locale data
storage translatable translated strings sometimes called message catalog1 strings called messages catalog generally comprises files specific localization format standard library handle said format software library format aids gettext
thus application support multiple languages would design application select relevant language resource file runtime code required manage data entry verification many localesensitive data types also must support differing locale requirements modern development systems operating systems include sophisticated libraries international support types also standard locale data
many localization issues writing direction text sorting require profound changes software text translation example openofficeorg achieves compilation switches
processedit
globalization method includes planning three implementation steps internationalization localization quality assurance1
degree quality assurance development team needs include someone handles basiccentral stages process enable others1 persons typically understand foreign languages cultures technical background specialized technical writers required construct culturally appropriate syntax potentially complicated concepts coupled engineering resources deploy test localization elements
properly internationalized software rely decentralized models localization free open source software usually rely selflocalization endusers volunteers sometimes organized teams14 kde3 project example translated languages15 mediawiki languages mostly complete 201616
translating existing text languages seem easy difficult maintain parallel versions texts throughout life product17 instance message displayed user modified translated versions must changed
commercial considerationsedit
commercial setting benefit localization access markets1 early 1980s lotus took years separate program code text lost market lead europe microsoft multiplan1
however considerable costs involved beyond engineering business operations must adapt manage production storage distribution multiple discrete localized products often sold completely different currencies regulatory environments regimes
finally sales marketing technical support must also facilitate operations languages order support customers localized products particularly relatively small language populations thus never economically viable offer localized product even large language populations could justify localization given product products internal structure already permits localization given software developerpublisher lack size sophistication manage ancillary functions associated operating multiple locales
