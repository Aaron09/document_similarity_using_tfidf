first half 1980s ethernets 10base5 implementation used coaxial cable 0375 inches diameter later called thick ethernet thicknet successor 10base2 called thin ethernet thinnet used rg58 coaxial cable emphasis making installation cable easier less costly3157
since communication happens wire information sent computer received even information intended destinationg network interface card interrupts applicable packets received card ignores information addressed single cable also means data bandwidth shared example available data bandwidth device halved stations simultaneously active32
collision happens stations attempt transmit time corrupt transmitted data require stations retransmit lost data retransmission reduces throughput worst case multiple active hosts connected maximum allowed cable length attempt transmit many short frames excessive collisions reduce throughput dramatically however xerox report 1980 studied performance existing ethernet installation normal artificially generated heavy load report claimed throughput observed33 contrast token passing lans token ring token suffer throughput degradation node comes token waits report controversial modeling showed collisionbased networks theoretically became unstable loads nominal capacity many early researchers failed understand results performance real networks significantly better34
modern ethernet stations share channel shared cable simple repeater instead station communicates switch turn forwards traffic destination station topology collisions possible station switch attempt communicate time collisions limited link furthermore 10baset standard introduced full duplex mode operation became common fast ethernet facto standard gigabit ethernet full duplex switch station send receive simultaneously therefore modern ethernets completely collisionfree
