decentralization area response problems centralized systems decentralization government topic studied seen solution problems like economic decline government inability fund services general decline performance overloaded services demands minorities greater local governance general weakening legitimacy public sector global international pressure countries inefficient undemocratic overly centralized systems33 following four goals objectives frequently stated various analyses decentralization
participation
decentralization principle subsidiarity often invoked holds lowest least centralized authority capable addressing issue effectively according definition decentralization decentralizing governance refers restructuring reorganization authority system coresponsibility institutions governance central regional local levels according principle subsidiarity thus increasing overall quality effectiveness system governance increasing authority capacities subnational levels34
decentralization often linked concepts participation decisionmaking democracy equality liberty higher authority3536 decentralization enhances democratic voice28 theorists believe local representative authorities actual discretionary powers basis decentralization lead local efficiency equity development”37 columbia universitys earth institute identified three major trends relating decentralization increased involvement local jurisdictions civil society management affairs forms participation consultation partnerships8
decentralization described counterpoint globalization removes decisions local national stage global sphere multinational nonnational interests decentralization brings decisionmaking back subnational levels decentralization strategies must account interrelations global regional national subnational local levels38
diversity
norman johnson writes diversity plays important role decentralized systems like ecosystems social groups large organizations political systems diversity defined unique properties entities agents individuals shared larger group population structure decentralized defined property system agents ability operate locally” decentralization diversity necessary attributes achieve selforganizing properties interest31
advocates political decentralization hold greater participation better informed diverse interests society lead relevant decisions made authorities national level39 decentralization described response demands diversity840
efficiency
business decentralization leads management results philosophy focuses definite objectives achieved unit results41 decentralization government programs said increase efficiency effectiveness reduction congestion communications quicker reaction unanticipated problems improved ability deliver services improved information local conditions support beneficiaries programs42
firms prefer decentralization ensures efficiency making sure managers closest local information make decisions timely fashion taking responsibility frees upper management long term strategics rather daytoday decisionmaking managers hands training prepare move management hierarchy managers motivated freedom exercise initiative creativity managers divisions encouraged prove profitable instead allowing failures masked overall profitability company43
principles applied government decentralization promises enhance efficiency intergovernmental competition market features fiscal discipline assigns expenditure authority lowest level government possible works best members subnational government strong traditions democracy accountability professionalism28
conflict resolution
economic andor political decentralization help prevent reduce conflict reduce actual perceived inequities various regions region central government44 dawn brancati finds political decentralization reduces intrastate conflict unless politicians create political parties mobilize minority even extremist groups demand resources power within national governments however likelihood done depends factors like democratic transitions happen features like regional partys proportion legislative seats countrys number regional legislatures elector procedures order national regional elections occur brancati holds decentralization promote peace encourages statewide parties incorporate regional demands limit power regional parties45

critiquesedit
factors hindering decentralization include weak local administrative technical capacity result inefficient ineffective services inadequate financial resources available perform local responsibilities especially startup phase needed inequitable distribution resources decentralization make national policy coordination complex allow local elites capture functions local cooperation undermined distrust private public sectors decentralization result higher enforcement costs conflict resources higher level authority159 additionally decentralization efficient standardized routine networkbased services opposed need complicated inputs loss economies scale procurement labor resources expense decentralization rise even central governments lose control financial resources50
challenges even dangers include possibility corrupt local elites capture regional local power centers constituents lose representation patronage politics become rampant civil servants feel compromised necessary decentralization stymied incomplete information hidden decisionmaking occur hierarchies centralized power centers find reasons frustrate decentralization bring power back themselvescitation needed
noted decentralization increase productive efficiency undermine allocative efficiency making redistribution wealth difficult decentralization cause greater disparities rich poor regions especially times crisis national government able help regions needing it160
averting dangers decentralization eight classic conditionsedit
literature identifies eight essential preconditions must ensured implementing decentralization order avert socalled “dangers decentralization” are161

social preparedness mechanisms prevent elite capture
strong administrative technical capacity higher levels
strong political commitment higher levels
