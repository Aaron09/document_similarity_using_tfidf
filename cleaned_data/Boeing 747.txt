development
background
1963 united states force started series study projects large strategic transport aircraft although c141 starlifter introduced believed much larger capable aircraft needed especially capability carry outsized cargo would existing aircraft studies initial requirements cxheavy logistics system cxhls march 1964 aircraft load capacity 180000 pounds 81600 speed mach unrefueled range 5000 nautical miles 9300 payload 115000 pounds 52200 payload feet wide feet high feet long access doors front rear14
featuring four engines design also required engine designs greatly increased power better fuel economy 1964 airframe proposals arrived boeing douglas general dynamics lockheed martin marietta engine proposals submitted general electric curtisswright pratt whitney downselect boeing douglas lockheed given additional study contracts airframe along general electric pratt whitney engines14
three airframe proposals shared number features cxhls needed able loaded front door included cockpit usually companies solved problem moving cockpit cargo area douglas small forward wing lockheed used long spine running length aircraft wing spar passing boeing blended longer behind nose behind wing1516 1965 lockheeds aircraft design general electrics engine design selected galaxy transport largest military aircraft world time14 nose door raised cockpit concepts would carried design 74717
airliner proposal
conceived travel increasing 1960s18 commercial transportation enormous popularity boeing douglas revolutionized longdistance travel1819 even lost cxhls contract boeing asked juan trippe president american world airways important airline customers build passenger aircraft twice size time airport congestion worsened increasing numbers passengers carried relatively small aircraft became problem trippe thought could addressed larger aircraft20
1965 sutter transferred boeings development team manage design studies airliner already assigned model number 74721 sutter initiated design study airlines better understand requirements time widely thought would eventually superseded supersonic transport aircraft22 boeing responded designing could adapted easily carry freight remain production even sales passenger version declined freighter role clear need support containerized shipping methodologies widely introduced time standard containers square front slightly higher attachment points available lengths meant would possible support 2wide 2high stack containers three ranks deep fuselage size similar earlier cxhls project

principal technologies enabled aircraft large drawn highbypass turbofan engine32 engine technology thought capable delivering double power earlier turbojets consuming third less fuel general electric pioneered concept committed developing engine galaxy enter commercial market later3334 pratt whitney also working principle late 1966 boeing pratt whitney agreed develop engine designated jt9d power 74734
project designed methodology called fault tree analysis allowed effects failure single part studied determine impact systems1 address concerns safety flyability 747s design included structural redundancy redundant hydraulic systems quadruple main landing gear dual control surfaces35 additionally advanced highlift devices used industry included design allow operate existing airports included slats running almost entire length wing well complex threepart slotted flaps along trailing edge wing36 wings complex threepart flaps increase wing area percent lift percent fully deployed compared nondeployed configuration37

development testing
