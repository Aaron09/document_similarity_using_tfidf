expeditiously review recipients financial logistical curatorial display plans ensure feasible consistent agencys educational goals processing delivery schedules
ensure recipient payments closely coordinated processing schedules impede nasas ability efficiently prepare orbiters museum display provide sufficient funds advance work performed
