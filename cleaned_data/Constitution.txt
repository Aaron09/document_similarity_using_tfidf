principles constitutional design
tribal people first began live cities establish nations many functioned according unwritten customs developed autocratic even tyrannical monarchs ruled decree mere personal whim rule thinkers take position mattered design governmental institutions operations much character rulers view seen plato called rule philosopherkings46 later writers aristotle cicero plutarch would examine designs government legal historical standpoint
renaissance brought series political philosophers wrote implied criticisms practices monarchs sought identify principles constitutional design would likely yield effective governance viewpoints began revival roman nations concept47 application relations among nations sought establish customary laws peace48 ameliorate wars make less likely considerations authority monarchs officials dont authority derives remedies abuse authority49
seminal juncture line discourse arose england civil cromwellian protectorate writings thomas hobbes samuel rutherford levellers john milton james harrington leading debate robert filmer arguing divine right monarchs side henry neville james tyrrell algernon sidney john locke arose latter concept government erected foundations first state nature governed natural laws state society established social contract compact bring underlying natural social laws governments formally established foundations
along several writers examined design government important even government headed monarch also classified various historical examples governmental designs typically democracies aristocracies monarchies considered effective tended advantages might obtained combining elements complex design balanced competing tendencies montesquieu also examined functions government legislative executive judicial might appropriately separated branches prevailing theme among writers design constitutions completely arbitrary matter taste generally held underlying principles design constrain constitutions every polity organization built ideas concerning principles might
later writings orestes brownson50 would explain constitutional designers trying according brownson sense three constitutions involved first constitution nature includes called natural second constitution society unwritten commonly understood rules society formed social contract establishes government establishes third constitution government second would include elements making decisions public conventions called public notice conducted established rules procedure constitution must consistent derive authority ones well historical society formation constitutional ratification brownson argued state society effective dominion welldefined territory consent welldesigned constitution government arises presence territory possible provisions written constitution government unconstitutional inconsistent constitutions nature society brownson argued ratification alone makes written constitution government legitimate must also competently designed applied
writers51 argued considerations apply national constitutions government also constitutions private organizations accident constitutions tend satisfy members contain certain elements minimum provisions tend become similar amended experience provisions give rise certain kinds questions seen need additional provisions resolve questions provisions offer course action best omitted left policy decisions provisions conflict brownson others discern underlying constitutions nature society tend difficult impossible execute lead unresolvable disputes
constitutional design treated kind metagame play consists finding best design provisions written constitution rules game government likely optimize balance utilities justice liberty security example metagame nomic52
political economy theory regards constitutions coordination devices help citizens prevent rulers abusing power citizenry coordinate response police government officials face constitutional fault government incentives honor rights constitution guarantees53 alternative view considers constitutions enforced citizens atlarge rather administrative powers state rulers cannot implement policies need rely organizations armies courts police agencies collectors implement position directly sanction government refusing cooperate disabling authority rulers therefore constitutions could characterized selfenforcing equilibria rulers powerful administrators54
