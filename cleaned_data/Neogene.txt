scene featuring miocene early neogene fauna


marine continental flora fauna modern appearance reptile group choristodera became extinct early part period amphibians known allocaudata disappeared mammals birds continued dominant terrestrial vertebrates took many forms adapted various habitats first hominids ancestors humans appeared southern europe migrated africa89
response cooler seasonal climate tropical plant species gave deciduous ones grasslands replaced many forests grasses therefore greatly diversified herbivorous mammals evolved alongside creating many grazing animals today horses antelope bison
disagreementsedit
neogene traditionally ended pliocene epoch older definition beginning quaternary period many time scales show division
however movement amongst geologists particularly marine geologists also include ongoing geological time quaternary neogene others particularly terrestrial geologists insist quaternary separate period distinctly different record somewhat confusing terminology disagreement amongst geologists draw hierarchical boundaries comparatively fine divisibility time units time approaches present geological preservation causes youngest sedimentary geological record preserved much larger area reflect many environments older geological record10 dividing cenozoic three arguably periods paleogene neogene quaternary instead seven epochs periods closely comparable duration periods mesozoic paleozoic eras
international commission stratigraphy proposed quaternary considered subera suberathem neogene beginning date namely start gelasian stage 2004 proposal neogene would consisted miocene pliocene epochs11 international union quaternary research inqua counterproposed neogene pliocene gelasian transferred pleistocene quaternary recognized third period cenozoic citing changes earths climate oceans biota occurred correspondence gaussmatuyama magnetostratigraphic boundary12 2006 inqua reached compromise made quaternary subera subdividing cenozoic classical tertiary quaternary compromise rejected international union geological sciences split neogene pliocene two13
following formal discussions international geological congress oslo norway august 200814 decided 2009 make quaternary youngest period cenozoic base including gelasian formerly considered part neogene period pliocene epoch15 thus neogene period ends bounding succeeding quaternary period
