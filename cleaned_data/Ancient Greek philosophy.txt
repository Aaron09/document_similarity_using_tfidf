presocratics primarily concerned cosmology ontology mathematics distinguished nonphilosophers insofar rejected mythological explanations favor reasoned discourse6
milesian schooledit
main article milesian school
thales miletus regarded aristotle first philosopher7 held things arise single material substance water8 gave cosmogony john burnet calls first science gave naturalistic explanation cosmos supported reasons9 according tradition thales able predict eclipse taught egyptians measure height pyramids10
thales inspired milesian school philosophy followed anaximander argued substratum arche could water classical elements instead something unlimited indefinite greek apeiron began observation world seems consist opposites cold thing become opposite thing cold therefore cannot truly opposites rather must manifestations underlying unity neither underlying unity substratum arche could classical elements since extreme another example water opposite fire opposite wet11 initial state ageless imperishable everything returns according necessity 12anaximenes turn held arche although john burnet argues meant transparent mist aether13 despite varied answers milesian school searching natural substance would remain unchanged despite appearing different forms thus represents first scientific attempts answer question would lead development modern atomic theory milesians says burnet asked φύσις things14
xenophanesedit

xenophanes born ionia milesian school powerful picked milesians cosmological theories result15 known argued phenomena natural rather divine explanation manner reminiscent anaximanders theories world whole ridiculed anthropomorphism greek religion claiming cattle would claim gods looked like cattle horses like horses lions like lions ethiopians claimed gods snubnosed black thracians claimed pale redhaired16
burnet says xenophanes however scientific many naturalistic explanations support render homeric gods superfluous foolish17 claimed influence eleatic philosophy although disputed precursor epicurus representative total break science religion18
pythagoreanismedit
main article pythagoreanism
pythagoras lived roughly time xenophanes contrast latter school founded sought reconcile religious belief reason little known life reliability however writings survive possible simply mystic whose successors introduced rationalism pythagoreanism simply rationalist whose successors responsible mysticism pythagoreanism actually author doctrine know certain19
pythagoras said disciple anaximander imbibed cosmological concerns ionians including idea cosmos constructed spheres importance infinite aether arche everything20 pythagoreanism also incorporated ascetic ideals emphasizing purgation metempsychosis consequently respect animal life much made correspondence mathematics cosmos musical harmony21 pythagoras believed behind appearance things permanent principle mathematics forms based transcendental mathematical relation22
heraclitusedit
main article heraclitus
heraclitus must lived xenophanes pythagoras condemns along homer proving much learning cannot teach think since parmenides refers past tense would place century bce23 contrary milesian school would stable element root heraclitus taught everything flows everything flux closest element flux fire things come pass accordance logos must considered plan formula25 logos common26 also extended teaching seeming opposites fact manifestations common substrate good evil itself27 heraclitus calls oppositional processes ἔρις eris strife hypothesizes apparently stable state δίκη dikê justice harmony it28
eleatic philosophyedit
main article eleatics
parmenides elea cast philosophy held things travel opposite directions—presumably referring heraclitus followed him29 whereas doctrines milesian school suggesting substratum could appear variety different guises implied everything exists corpuscular parmenides argued first principle indivisible unchanging30 argued definition implies eternality thought thing moreover cannot less rarefaction condensation milesians impossible regarding lastly movement requires something exist apart thing moving space moves cannot move since would require space exist exist31 doctrine odds ordinary sensory experience things indeed change move eleatic school followed parmenides denying sense phenomena revealed world actually instead thing thought question whether something exists whether thought32
support parmenides pupil zeno elea attempted prove concept motion absurd motion exist also attacked subsequent development pluralism arguing incompatible being33 arguments known zenos paradoxes
pluralism atomismedit
power parmenides logic subsequent philosophers abandoned monism milesians xenophanes heraclitus parmenides thing arche adopted pluralism empedocles anaxagoras34 said multiple elements reducible another motion love strife empedocles mind anaxagoras agreeing parmenides coming passing away genesis decay said things appear come pass away elements composed assemble disassemble unchanging35
leucippus also proposed ontological pluralism cosmogony based main elements vacuum atoms means inherent movement crossing void creating real material bodies theories well known time plato however ultimately incorporated work student democritus36
sophistryedit
main article sophists
sophistry arose juxtaposition physis nature nomos john burnet posits origin scientific progress previous centuries suggested radically different experienced senses comprehensible comprehensible terms order world lived hand order albeit humankinds making37 time nature constant differed place another could changed
first call sophist according plato protagoras presents teaching virtue conventional protagoras claimed measure things things things plato interprets radical perspectivism things seem person actually another another person actually well conclusion cannot look nature guidance regarding live ones life38
protagoras subsequent sophists tended teach rhetoric primary vocation prodicus gorgias hippias thrasymachus appear various dialogues sometimes explicitly teaching nature provides ethical guidance guidance laws provide worthless nature favors laws

platoedit
main article plato
plato athenian generation socrates ancient tradition ascribes thirtysix dialogues thirteen letters although twentyfour dialogues universally recognized authentic modern scholars believe least twentyeight dialogues letters fact written plato although thirtysix dialogues defenders50 nine dialogues ascribed plato considered spurious even antiquity51
platos dialogues feature socrates although always leader conversation dialogue laws instead contains athenian stranger along xenophon plato primary source information socrates life beliefs always easy distinguish socrates presented dialogues often taken platos mouthpiece socrates reputation irony caginess regarding opinions dialogues occasional absence minor role conversation serve conceal platos doctrines52 much said doctrines derived aristotle reports
political doctrine ascribed plato derived republic laws statesman first contains suggestion justice cities unless ruled philosopher kings responsible enforcing laws compelled hold women children property common individual taught pursue common good noble lies republic says city likely impossible however generally assuming philosophers would refuse rule people would refuse compel so53
whereas republic premised distinction sort knowledge possessed philosopher possessed king political socrates explores character philosopher statesman hand participant referred eleatic stranger discusses sort knowledge possessed political socrates listens quietly53 although rule wise would preferable rule wise cannot help judged unwise practice rule deemed necessary
republic statesman reveal limitations politics raising question political order would best given constraints question addressed laws dialogue take place athens socrates absent53 character society described eminently conservative corrected liberalized timocracy spartan cretan model predemocratic athens53
platos dialogues also metaphysical themes famous theory forms holds nonmaterial abstract substantial forms ideas material world change known physical senses possess highest fundamental kind reality
