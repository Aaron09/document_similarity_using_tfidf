allowed relatively inexpensive commercial binary sublicensing unix 1979 variety proprietary systems developed based including hpux irix sunos tru64 ultrix xenix largely displaced proprietary clones growing incompatibility among systems creation interoperability standards including posix single unix specification
various free lowcost unrestricted substitutes unix emerged 1980s 1990s including 44bsd linux minix turn basis commercial unixlike systems bsdos macos several versions xmacos running intelbased computers certified single unix specification567891011 variants descendants unix developed university california berkeley unix source code bell labs however code base evolved since replacing code since variants certified compliant single unix specification referred unixlike rather unix

compatibility layersedit
nonunixlike operating systems provide unixlike compatibility layer variable degrees unixlike functionality

zoss unix system services sufficiently complete certified trademark unix
cygwin msys provide environment microsoft windows user sufficient common open source software compiled
toolkit uwin comprehensive interoperability tools allow porting unix programmes windows
windows type systems posix environmental subsystem
subsystem unixbased applications previously interix provides unixlike functionality windows subsystem discontinued
windows subsystem linux provides linuxcompatible kernel interface developed microsoft containing linux code ubuntu usermode binaries running it16

means windowsunix interoperability include

windows packages used various servers windows
hummingbird connectivity provides several ways windows machines connect unix linux machines terminal emulators clients servers others
windows resource kits versions windows include bourne shell commandline tools version perl
hamilton shell version written specifically windows
