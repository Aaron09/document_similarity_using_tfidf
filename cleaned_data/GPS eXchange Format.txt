waypoints routes tracks recorded receivers


essential data contained files2 ellipsis means previous element repeated additional data exist within every markup shown

wpttype individual waypoint among collection points sequential relationship consists coordinates point possibly descriptive information
rtetype route ordered list routepoint waypoints representing series significant turn stage points leading destination3
trktype track made least segment containing waypoints ordered list points describing path3 track segment holds list track points logically connected order represent single track reception lost receiver turned start track segment continuous span track data

conceptually tracks record person routes suggestions might future example point track timestamp someone recorded points route unlikely timestamps estimated trip duration route suggestion might never traveled
technically

track made sufficient number trackpoints precisely draw every bend path bitmap either

output example recording course ones trip
rearrangement points remove excess ones
data source extracted vector


route made routepoints program must corresponding track vector draw routepoints crossings junctions distant stopover towns making trip project hence project saved reloaded file
process called routing computes route produce route made routepoints driver action takes place turn left enter roundabout limit speed name next direction road points contain text instructions
file contain route track program precise points track even access vector
