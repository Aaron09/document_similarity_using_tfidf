mathematics modular arithmetic system arithmetic integers numbers wrap around upon reaching certain value—the modulus plural moduli modern approach modular arithmetic developed carl friedrich gauss book disquisitiones arithmeticae published 1801
familiar modular arithmetic 12hour clock divided 12hour periods time hours later usual addition would suggest later time answer clock time wraps around every hours hour number starts reaches arithmetic modulo according definition congruent also time called 1200 could also called since congruent modulo

definition congruence relationedit
section notation binary operation modulo operation
modular arithmetic handled mathematically introducing congruence relation integers compatible operations integers addition subtraction multiplication positive integer numbers said congruent modulo difference integer multiple integer congruence relation typically considered integers denoted



















displaystyle aequiv bpmod



authors instead case parentheses omitted generally means denotes modulo operation
number called modulus congruence
congruence relation rewritten














displaystyle aknb

equivalently also thought asserting remainders division instance



















displaystyle 38equiv 14pmod



remainder divided also case integer multiple agrees prior definition congruence relation
remark notation common consider several congruence relations different moduli time modulus incorporated notation spite ternary notation congruence relation given modulus binary would clearer notation used instead common traditional notation
propertiesedit
congruence relation satisfies conditions equivalence relation

reflexivity
symmetry
transitivity



integer compatibility translation
integer compatibility scaling
compatibility addition
compatibility subtraction
compatibility multiplication
nonnegative integer compatibility exponentiation
polynomial integer coefficients compatibility polynomial evaluation

false general however

eulers totient function provided coprime

cancellation common terms following rules

integer
coprime

modular multiplicative inverse defined following rules

existence exists integer denoted aa–1 coprime integer called modular multiplicative inverse modulo
exists compatibility multiplicative inverse uniqueness modulo
coprime solution linear congruence given a–1b

particular prime number coprime every thus multiplicative inverse exists congruent zero modulo
advanced properties congruence relations following

fermats little theorem prime
eulers theorem coprime eulers totient function
simple consequence fermats little theorem prime multiplicative inverse generally eulers theorem coprime
another simple consequence eulers totient function provided coprime

chinese remainder theorem coprime mn–1 nm–1 mn−1 inverse modulo nm−1 inverse modulo
lagranges theorem congruence prime polynomial integer coefficients roots
primitive root modulo number primitive root modulo every integer coprime integer primitive root modulo exists equal prime number primitive root modulo exists exactly primitive roots eulers totient function
quadratic residue integer quadratic residue modulo exists integer eulers criterion asserts prime quadratic residue modulo

congruence classes edit
like congruence relation congruence modulo equivalence relation equivalence class integer denoted consisting integers congruent modulo called congruence class residue class simply residue integer modulo modulus known context residue also denoted
residue systemsedit
residue class modulo represented members although usually represent residue class smallest nonnegative integer belongs class since proper remainder results division members different residue classes modulo incongruent modulo furthermore every integer belongs residue class modulo
integers called least residue system modulo integers congruent modulo called complete residue system modulo
clear least residue system complete residue system complete residue system simply containing precisely representative residue class modulo least residue system modulo complete residue systems modulo








sets complete residue systems modulo

since congruent modulo
since complete residue system modulo must exactly incongruent residue classes

reduced residue systemsedit
main article reduced residue system
integers relatively prime mutually incongruent modulo denotes eulers totient function called reduced residue system modulo example example reduced residue system modulo
