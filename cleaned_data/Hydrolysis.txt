generic mechanism hydrolysis reaction 2way yield symbol indicates equilibrium hydrolysis condensation ways


hydrolysis haɪˈdrɒlɪsɪs ancient greek hydro meaning water lysis meaning unbind usually means cleavage chemical bonds addition water carbohydrate broken component sugar molecules hydrolysis sucrose broken glucose fructose termed saccharification generally hydrolysis saccharification step degradation substance language chemistry reaction cation anion water molecule altered cleavage bond hydrolysis takes place
hydrolysis reverse condensation reaction molecules join together larger eject water molecule thus hydrolysis adds water break whereas condensation builds removing water solvents

typesedit
usually hydrolysis chemical process molecule water added substance sometimes addition causes substance water molecule split parts reactions fragment target molecule parent molecule gains hydrogen
saltsedit
common kind hydrolysis occurs salt weak acid weak base dissolved water water spontaneously ionizes hydroxide anions hydronium cations salt also dissociates constituent anions cations example sodium acetate dissociates water sodium acetate ions sodium ions react little hydroxide ions whereas acetate ions combine hydronium ions produce acetic acid case result relative excess hydroxide ions yielding basic solution
strong acids also undergo hydrolysis example dissolving sulfuric acid h2so4 water accompanied hydrolysis give hydronium bisulfate sulfuric acids conjugate base technical discussion occurs hydrolysis brønsted–lowry acid–base theory
esters amidesedit
acid–basecatalysed hydrolyses common example hydrolysis amides esters hydrolysis occurs nucleophile nucleusseeking agent water hydroxyl attacks carbon carbonyl group ester amide aqueous base hydroxyl ions better nucleophiles polar molecules water acids carbonyl group becomes protonated leads much easier nucleophilic attack products hydrolyses compounds carboxylic acid groups
perhaps oldest commercially practiced example ester hydrolysis saponification formation soap hydrolysis triglyceride aqueous base sodium hydroxide naoh process glycerol formed fatty acids react base converting salts salts called soaps commonly used households
addition living systems biochemical reactions including hydrolysis take place catalysis enzymes catalytic action enzymes allows hydrolysis proteins fats oils carbohydrates example consider proteases enzymes digestion causing hydrolysis peptide bonds proteins catalyse hydrolysis interior peptide bonds peptide chains opposed exopeptidases another class enzymes catalyse hydrolysis terminal peptide bonds liberating free amino acid time
however proteases catalyse hydrolysis kinds proteins action stereoselective proteins certain tertiary structure targeted kind orienting force needed place amide group proper position catalysis necessary contacts enzyme substrates proteins created enzyme folds form crevice substrate fits crevice also contains catalytic groups therefore proteins crevice undergo hydrolysis specificity preserves integrity proteins hormones therefore biological system continues function normally
upon hydrolysis amide converts carboxylic acid amine ammonia presence acid immediately converted ammonium salts oxygen groups carboxylic acid derived water molecule amine ammonia gains hydrogen hydrolysis peptides gives amino acids

polysaccharides edit




sucrose glycoside bond represented central oxygen atom holds monosaccharide units together


monosaccharides linked together glycosidic bonds cleaved hydrolysis three several many monosaccharides thus linked form disaccharides trisaccharides oligosaccharides polysaccharides respectively enzymes hydrolyse glycosidic bonds called glycoside hydrolases glycosidases
bestknown disaccharide sucrose table sugar hydrolysis sucrose yields glucose fructose invertase sucrase used industrially hydrolysis sucrose socalled invert sugar lactase essential digestive hydrolysis lactose milk many adult humans produce lactase cannot digest lactose milk disorder
hydrolysis polysaccharides soluble sugars called saccharification malt made barley used source βamylase break starch disaccharide maltose used yeast produce beer amylase enzymes convert starch glucose oligosaccharides cellulose first hydrolyzed cellobiose cellulase cellobiose hydrolyzed glucose betaglucosidase animals cows ruminants able hydrolyze cellulose cellobiose glucose symbiotic bacteria produce cellulases
