historical foundationedit
psychological testing come streams thought first darwin galton cattell measurement individual differences second herbart weber fechner wundt psychophysical measurements similar construct second individuals research development experimental psychology standardized testing2
victorian streamedit
charles darwin inspiration behind francis galton creation psychometrics 1859 darwin published book origin species pertained individual differences animals book discussed individual members species differ possess characteristics adaptive successful less adaptive less successful adaptive successful ones survive give next generation would adaptive successful idea studied previously animals galtons interest study human beings differ another importantly measure differences
galton wrote book entitled hereditary genius different characteristics people possess characteristics make others today differences sensory motor functioning reaction time visual acuity physical strength important domains scientific psychology much early theoretical applied work psychometrics undertaken attempt measure intelligence galton often referred father psychometrics devised included mental tests among anthropometric measures james mckeen cattell considered pioneer psychometrics went extend galtons work cattell also coined term mental test responsible research knowledge ultimately development modern tests kaplan saccuzzo 2010
german streamedit
origin psychometrics also connections related field psychophysics around time darwin galton cattell making discoveries herbart also interested unlocking mysteries human consciousness scientific method kaplan saccuzzo 2010 herbart responsible creating mathematical models mind influential educational practices years come
weber built upon herbarts work tried prove existence psychological threshold saying minimum stimulus necessary activate sensory system weber fechner expanded upon knowledge gleaned herbart weber devise strength sensation grows logarithm stimulus intensity follower weber fechner wilhelm wundt credited founding science psychology wundts influence paved others develop psychological testing2
20th centuryedit
psychometrician thurstone founder first president psychometric society 1936 developed applied theoretical approach measurement referred comparative judgment approach close connections psychophysical theory ernst heinrich weber gustav fechner addition spearman thurstone made important contributions theory application factor analysis statistical method developed used extensively psychometricscitation needed late 1950s leopold szondi made historical epistemological assessment impact statistical thinking onto psychology previous decades last decades specifically psychological thinking almost completely suppressed removed replaced statistical thinking precisely cancer testology testomania today3
recently psychometric theory applied measurement personality attitudes beliefs academic achievement measurement unobservable phenomena difficult much research accumulated science discipline developed attempt properly define quantify phenomena critics including practitioners physical sciences social activists argued definition quantification impossibly difficult measurements often misused psychometric personality tests used employment procedures

example employer wanting someone role requiring consistent attention repetitive detail probably want give someone creative gets bored easily4

figures made significant contributions psychometrics include karl pearson henry kaiser carl brigham thurstone anne anastasi georg rasch eugene galanter johnson oconnor frederic lord ledyard tucker arthur jensen david andrich
definition measurement social sciencesedit
definition measurement social sciences long history currently widespread definition proposed stanley smith stevens 1946 measurement assignment numerals objects events according rule definition introduced paper stevens proposed four levels measurement although widely adopted definition differs important respects classical definition measurement adopted physical sciences namely scientific measurement entails estimation discovery ratio magnitude quantitative attribute unit attribute 3585
indeed stevenss definition measurement forward response british ferguson committee whose chair ferguson physicist committee appointed 1932 british association advancement science investigate possibility quantitatively estimating sensory events although chair members physicists committee also included several psychologists committees report highlighted importance definition measurement stevenss response propose definition considerable influence field means response report another notably different response accept classical definition reflected following statement

measurement psychology physics sense different physicists measure find operations meet necessary criteria psychologists need worry mysterious differences meaning measurement sciences reese 1943

divergent responses reflected alternative approaches measurement example methods based covariance matrices typically employed premise numbers scores derived assessments measurements approaches implicitly entail stevenss definition measurement requires numbers assigned according rule main research task generally considered discovery associations scores factors posited underlie associationscitation needed
hand measurement models rasch model employed numbers assigned based rule instead keeping reeses statement specific criteria measurement stated goal construct procedures operations provide data meet relevant criteria measurements estimated based models tests conducted ascertain whether relevant criteria metcitation needed
instruments proceduresedit
firstcitation neededpsychometric instruments designed measure concept intelligence6 historical approach involved stanfordbinet test developed originally french psychologist alfred binet intelligence tests useful tools various purposes alternative conception intelligence cognitive capacities within individuals manifestation general component general intelligence factor well cognitive capacity specific given domaincitation needed
psychometrics applied widelycitation needed educational assessment measure abilities domains reading writing mathematics main approaches applying tests domains classical test theory recent item response theory rasch measurement models latter approaches permit joint scaling persons assessment items provides basis mapping developmental continua allowing descriptions skills displayed various points along continuumcitation needed
another major focus psychometrics personality testing range theoretical approaches conceptualizing measuring personality better known instruments include minnesota multiphasic personality inventory fivefactor model tools personality preference inventory myersbriggs type indicator attitudes also studied extensively using psychometric approachescitation needed common method measurement attitudes likert scale alternative method involves application unfolding measurement models general hyperbolic cosine model andrich 19937
theoretical approachesedit
psychometricians developed number different measurement theories include classical test theory item response theory irt89 approach seems mathematically similar also quite distinctive terms origins features represented rasch model measurement development rasch model broader class models belongs explicitly founded requirements measurement physical sciences10
psychometricians also developed methods working large matrices correlations covariances techniques general tradition include factor analysis11 method determining underlying dimensions data multidimensional scaling12 method finding simple representation data large number latent dimensions data clustering approach finding objects like multivariate descriptive methods distill large amounts data simpler structures recently structural equation modeling13 path analysis represent sophisticated approaches working large covariance matrices methods allow statistically sophisticated models fitted data tested determine adequate fits
main deficiencies various factor analyses lack consensus cutting points determining number latent factors usual procedure stop factoring eigenvalues drop original sphere shrinks lack cutting points concerns multivariate methods alsocitation needed
conceptsedit
concepts classical test theory reliability validity reliable measure measures construct consistently across time individuals situations valid measure measures intended measure reliability necessary sufficient validity
reliability validity assessed statistically consistency repeated measures test assessed pearson correlation coefficient often called testretest reliability14 similarly equivalence different versions measure indexed pearson correlation called equivalent forms reliability similar term14
internal consistency addresses homogeneity single test form assessed correlating performance halves test termed splithalf reliability value pearson productmoment correlation coefficient halftests adjusted spearman–brown prediction formula correspond correlation fulllength tests14 perhaps commonly used index reliability cronbachs equivalent mean possible splithalf coefficients approaches include intraclass correlation ratio variance measurements given target variance targets
number different forms validity criterionrelated validity assessed correlating measure criterion measure theoretically expected related criterion measure collected time measure validated goal establish concurrent validity criterion collected later goal establish predictive validity measure construct validity related measures constructs required theory content validity demonstration items test adequate covering domain measured personnel selection example test content based defined statement statements knowledge skill ability characteristics obtained analysis
item response theory models relationship latent traits responses test items among advantages provides basis obtaining estimate location testtaker given latent trait well standard error measurement location example university students knowledge history deduced score university test compared reliably high school students knowledge deduced less difficult test scores derived classical test theory characteristic assessment actual ability rather ability relative testtakers must assessed comparing scores norm group randomly selected population fact measures derived classical test theory dependent sample tested principle derived item response theory
many psychometricians also concerned finding eliminating test bias psychological tests test bias form systematic nonrandom error leads examinees demographic group unwarranted advantage examinees another demographic group15 according leading experts test bias cause differences average scores across demographic groups differences group scores sufficient evidence test bias actually present test could measuring real differences among groups1617 psychometricians sophisticated scientific methods search test bias eliminate research shows usually impossible people reading test item accurately determine whether biased not18
standards qualityedit
considerations validity reliability typically viewed essential elements determining quality test however professional practitioner associations frequently placed concerns within broader contexts developing standards making overall judgments quality test whole within given context consideration concern many applied research settings whether metric given psychological inventory meaningful arbitrary19
testing standardsedit
2014 american educational research association aera american psychological association national council measurement education ncme published revision standards educational psychological testing20 describes standards test development evaluation standards cover essential topics testing including validity reliabilityerrors measurement fairness testing book also establishes standards related testing operations including test design development scores scales norms score linking scores test administration scoring reporting score interpretation test documentation rights responsibilities test takers test users finally standards cover topics related testing applications including psychological testing assessment workplace testing credentialing educational testing assessment testing program evaluation public policy
