early 20thcentury comparison elemental solar stellar spectra


although astronomy ancient recorded history long separated study terrestrial physics aristotelian worldview bodies appeared unchanging spheres whose motion uniform motion circle earthly world realm underwent growth decay natural motion straight line ended moving object reached goal consequently held celestial region made fundamentally different kind matter found terrestrial sphere either fire maintained plato aether maintained aristotle56 17th century natural philosophers galileo7 descartes8 newton9 began maintain celestial terrestrial regions made similar kinds material subject natural laws10 challenge tools invented prove assertions11
much nineteenth century astronomical research focused routine work measuring positions computing motions astronomical objects1213 astronomy soon called astrophysics began emerge william hyde wollaston joseph fraunhofer independently discovered decomposing light multitude dark lines regions less light observed spectrum14 1860 physicist gustav kirchhoff chemist robert bunsen demonstrated dark lines solar spectrum corresponded bright lines spectra known gases specific lines corresponding unique chemical elements15 kirchhoff deduced dark lines solar spectrum caused absorption chemical elements solar atmosphere16 proved chemical elements found stars also found earth
among extended study solar stellar spectra norman lockyer 1868 detected bright well dark lines solar spectra working chemist edward frankland investigate spectra elements various temperatures pressures could associate yellow line solar spectrum known elements thus claimed line represented element called helium greek helios personified1718
1885 edward pickering undertook ambitious program stellar spectral classification harvard college observatory team woman computers notably williamina fleming antonia maury annie jump cannon classified spectra recorded photographic plates 1890 catalog 10000 stars prepared grouped thirteen spectral types following pickerings vision 1924 cannon expanded catalog nine volumes quarter million stars developing harvard classification scheme accepted worldwide 192219
1895 george ellery hale james keeler along group associate editors europe united states20 established astrophysical journal international review spectroscopy astronomical physics21 intended journal would fill journals astronomy physics providing venue publication articles astronomical applications spectroscope laboratory research closely allied astronomical physics including wavelength determinations metallic gaseous spectra experiments radiation absorption theories moon planets comets meteors nebulae instrumentation telescopes laboratories20
around 1920 following discovery hertsprungrussell diagram still used basis classifying stars evolution arthur eddington anticipated discovery mechanism nuclear fusion processes stars paper internal constitution stars2223 time source stellar energy complete mystery eddington correctly speculated source fusion hydrogen helium liberating enormous energy according einsteins equation particularly remarkable development since time fusion thermonuclear energy even stars largely composed hydrogen metallicity discoverednonprimary source needed
1925 cecilia helena payne later cecilia paynegaposchkin wrote influential doctoral dissertation radcliffe college applied ionization theory stellar atmospheres relate spectral classes temperature stars24 significantly discovered hydrogen helium principal components stars despite eddingtons suggestion discovery unexpected dissertation readers convinced modify conclusion publication however later research confirmed discovery25
20th century studies astronomical spectra expanded cover wavelengths extending radio waves optical xray gamma wavelengths26 21st century expanded include observations based gravitational waves

observational astronomy division astronomical science concerned recording data contrast theoretical astrophysics mainly concerned finding measurable implications physical models practice observing celestial objects using telescopes astronomical apparatus
majority astrophysical observations made using electromagnetic spectrum

radio astronomy studies radiation wavelength greater millimeters example areas study radio waves usually emitted cold objects interstellar dust clouds cosmic microwave background radiation redshifted light bang pulsars first detected microwave frequencies study waves requires large radio telescopes
infrared astronomy studies radiation wavelength long visible naked shorter radio waves infrared observations usually made telescopes similar familiar optical telescopes objects colder stars planets normally studied infrared frequencies
optical astronomy oldest kind astronomy telescopes paired chargecoupled device spectroscopes common instruments used earths atmosphere interferes somewhat optical observations adaptive optics space telescopes used obtain highest possible image quality wavelength range stars highly visible many chemical spectra observed study chemical composition stars galaxies nebulae
ultraviolet xray gamma astronomy study energetic processes binary pulsars black holes magnetars many others kinds radiation penetrate earths atmosphere well methods observe part electromagnetic spectrum—spacebased telescopes groundbased imaging cherenkov telescopes iact examples observatories first type rxte chandra xray observatory compton gamma observatory examples iacts high energy stereoscopic system hess magic telescope

electromagnetic radiation things observed earth originate great distances gravitational wave observatories constructed gravitational waves extremely difficult detect neutrino observatories also built primarily study cosmic rays consisting high energy particles observed hitting earths atmosphere
observations also vary time scale optical observations take minutes hours phenomena change faster cannot readily observed however historical data objects available spanning centuries millennia hand radio observations look events millisecond timescale millisecond pulsars combine years data pulsar deceleration studies information obtained different timescales different
study special place observational astrophysics tremendous distance stars observed kind detail unparalleled star understanding serves guide understanding stars
topic stars change stellar evolution often modeled placing varieties star types respective positions hertzsprung–russell diagram viewed representing state stellar object birth destruction

theoretical astrophysicists wide variety tools include analytical models example polytropes approximate behaviors star computational numerical simulations advantages analytical models process generally better giving insight heart going numerical models reveal existence phenomena effects would otherwise seen2728
theorists astrophysics endeavor create theoretical models figure observational consequences models helps allow observers look data refute model help choosing several alternate conflicting models
theorists also generate modify models take account data case inconsistency general tendency make minimal modifications model data cases large amount inconsistent data time lead total abandonment model
