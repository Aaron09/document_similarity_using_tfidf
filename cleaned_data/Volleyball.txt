image international match italy russia 2005 russian player left served three team next moving assigned block positions starting ones others backrow positions preparing defense italy right three line preparing pass ball reaches setter waiting pass middle hitter jump quick pass good enough alessandro passing duties preparing backrow right side field note liberos different color dress middle hittersblockers commonly substituted liberos backrow positions


player specialization
positions filled every volleyball team elite level setter outside hitterleft side hitter middle hitter opposite hitterright side hitter liberodefensive specialist positions plays specific role winning volleyball match

setters task orchestrating offense team second touch main responsibility place ball attackers place ball opponents court point able operate hitters manage tempo side court choose right attackers setters need swift skillful appraisal tactical accuracy must quick moving around court
liberos defensive players responsible receiving attack serve usually players court quickest reaction time best passing skills libero means free italian—they receive name ability substitute player court play necessarily need tall never play allows shorter players strong passing defensive skills excel position play important role teams success player designated libero match play roles match liberos wear different color jersey teammates
middle blockers middle hitters players perform fast attacks usually take place near setter specialized blocking since must attempt stop equally fast plays opponents quickly double block sides court nonbeginners play every team middle hitters
outside hitters left side hitters attack near left antenna outside hitter usually consistent hitter team gets sets inaccurate first passes usually result outside hitter rather middle opposite since sets outside high outside hitter take longer approach always starting outside court sideline nonbeginners play outside hitters every team every match
opposite hitters rightside hitters carry defensive workload volleyball team front primary responsibilities well formed block opponents outside hitters serve backup setter sets opposite usually right side antennae

levels substitutions unlimited teams make defensive specialist place addition libero position unique rules like libero position instead players used substitute poor back defender using regular substitution rules defensive specialist often used particularly poor back court defender right side left side team already using libero take middles often situation involves team using right side player block must subbed back arent able effectively play back court defense similarly teams might serving specialist poor server situationally

three standard volleyball formations known refers number hitters setters respectively basic formation used beginners play common formation highlevel play

formation four hitters setters setters usually middle front right front position team therefore frontrow attackers times international setters right front position international translates easily forms offense
setters line opposite rotation typical lineup outside hitters aligning like positions opposite rotation always position front back rows service players front move assigned positions setter always middle front alternatively setter moves right front middle outside attacker disadvantage lies lack offside hitter allowing teams blockers cheat middle block
clear disadvantage offensive formation attackers leaving team fewer offensive weapons
another aspect setter attacking force albeit weakened force setter front court able dump ball close second touch setter ball hand means blocker would otherwise block setter engaged allow hitters easier attack

formation player always comes forward back three front players attacking positions thus players hitters time another setters formation actually system backrow setter penetrates
lineup thus requires setters line opposite rotation addition setters typical lineup middle hitters outside hitters aligning like positions opposite rotation always position front back rows service players front move assigned positions
advantage always three frontrow hitters available maximizing offensive possibilities however require team possess people capable performing highly specialized role setter also requires players effective offensive hitters setter position international level cuban national womens team employs kind formation also used ncaa teams division mens play womens play divisions partially variant rules used allow substitutions allowed standard rules—12 matches involving division mens teams26 womens play27

formation player assumes setting responsibilities regardless position rotation team therefore three frontrow attackers setter back setter front total five possible attackers
player opposite setter rotation called opposite hitter general opposite hitters pass stand behind teammates opponent serving opposite hitter used third attack option backrow attack setter front normal option used increase attack capabilities modern volleyball teams normally opposite hitter technically skilled hitter team backrow attacks generally come backright position known zone increasingly performed backcenter highlevel play
advantage system setter always hitters vary sets setter well opponents middle blocker enough time block outside blocker increasing chance attacking team make point
another advantage formation setter frontrow player allowed jump dump ball onto opponents side confuse opponents blocking players setter jump dump hitters good setter knows thus wont jump dump quick setting outside well confuse opponent
offense actually setter front offense looks like setter back offense looks like
