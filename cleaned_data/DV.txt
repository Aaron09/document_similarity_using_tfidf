audio stored either forms 16bit linear stereo sampling rate kbits channel mbits stereo four nonlinear 12bit channels sampling rate kbits channel mbits four channels addition specification also supports 16bit audio kbits channel mbits stereo sampling rate used audio8 practice stereo mode used almost exclusively
digital interface formatedit

variants except dvcpro progressive recorded tape within interlaced video stream filmlike frame rates possible using pulldown dvcpro supports native progressive format recorded memory cards
dvcproedit




dvcpro compatibility mark


dvcpro also known dvcpro25 variation developed panasonic introduced 1995 electronic news gathering equipment
unlike baseline dvcpro uses locked audio chroma subsampling variants decrease generation losses11 audio available 16bit48 precision
recorded tape dvcpro uses wider track pitch baseline reduces chance dropout errors recording extra longitudinal tracks provide support audio timecode control tape transported faster compared baseline resulting shorter recording time long play mode available
dvcamedit




dvcam compatibility mark


1996 sony responded professional version called dvcam12
like dvcpro dvcam uses locked audio prevents audio synchronization drift happen several generations copies made13
recorded tape dvcam uses track pitch wider compared baseline accordingly tape transported faster reduces recording time third compared regular wider track track pitch dvcam ability frameaccurate insert edit regular vary frames edit compared preview

main competitor dvcpro hdcam offered sony uses similar compression scheme higher bitrate
progressive recordingedit
tapebased variants except dvcpro progressive support native progressive recording therefore progressively acquired video recorded within interlaced video stream using pulldown technique used television industry broadcast movies progressivescan camcorders market record 24frames video using pulldown 30frames video using pulldown progressivescan camcorders market record 25frames video using pulldown

mixing tapes different manufacturersedit
considerable controversy solely based hearsay whether using tapes different manufacturers could lead dropouts2324 initially suggested around conception mostly minidv tapes late manufacturers minidv tapes sony produce tapes solely sony brand panasonic produce tapes panasonic brand outsources canon used different lubrication types cameras sony uses lubricant metal evaporated panasonic uses lubricant metal particle
though controversy still remain standard practice encouraging casual professional camera operators alike brands tapes different lubrication formulations cause encourage tape wear cleaned cleaning cassette significant problems occurred last years meaning switching tapes acceptable though sticking brand cleaning heads cleaning cassette highly recommended
research undertaken sony claimed hard evidence statement evidence claimed using tapes equipment designed tapes cause tape damage hence dropouts25unreliable source sony done significant amount internal testing simulate head clogs result mixing tape lubricants unable recreate problemdubious discuss sony recommends using cleaning cassettes every hours recording playback still skeptical sony recommends cleaning video heads cleaning cassette trying another brand tape
