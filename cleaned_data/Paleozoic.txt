cambrian periodedit
main article cambrian




trilobites


cambrian spans million years million years first period paleozoic phanerozoic cambrian marked boom evolution event known cambrian explosion largest number creatures evolved single period history earth creatures like algae evolved ubiquitous period armored arthropods like trilobites almost marine phyla evolved period time supercontinent pannotia begins break later became supercontinent gondwana
ordovician periodedit
main article ordovician




cephalaspis jawless fish


ordovician spanned approximately million years approximately million years ordovician time earths history many biological classes still prevalent today evolved primitive fish cephalopods coral common forms life however trilobites snails shellfish importantly first arthropods went ashore colonize empty continent gondwana ordovican gondwana south pole early north america collided europe closing atlantic ocean glaciation africa resulted major drop level killing life established along coastal gondwana glaciation caused ordovician–silurian extinction events marine invertebrates families became extinct considered first mass extinction event second deadliest
silurian periodedit
main article silurian
silurian spanned million years silurian rejuvenation life earth recovered previous glaciation period mass evolution fish jawless fish became numerous jawed fish evolved first freshwater fish evolved though arthropods scorpions still apex predators fully terrestrial life evolved including early arachnids fungi centipedes evolution vascular plants cooksonia allowed plants gain foothold land early plants forerunners plant life land time four continents gondwana africa south america australia antarctica siberia laurentia north america baltica northern europe avalonia western europe recent rise levels allowed many species thrive water9
devonian periodedit
main article devonian




eogyrinus amphibian carboniferous


devonian spanned million years million years also known fish devonian featured huge diversification fish including armored fish like dunkleosteus lobefinned fish eventually evolved first tetrapods land plant groups diversified incredibly event known devonian explosion plants made lignin allowing taller growth vascular tissue first trees evolved well seeds event also diversified arthropod life providing habitats first amphibians also evolved fish food chain near devonian species became extinct event known late devonian extinction second mass extinction event world seen
carboniferous periodedit
main article carboniferous
carboniferous spanned million million years time average global temperatures exceedingly high early carboniferous averaged degrees celsius cooled middle carboniferous tropical swamps dominated earth lignin stiffened trees grew greater heights number bacteria fungi capable eating lignin evolved remains left buried created much carbon became coal deposits today hence name carboniferous perhaps important evolutionary development time evolution amniotic eggs allowed amphibians move farther inland remain dominant vertebrates duration period also first reptiles synapsids evolved swamps throughout carboniferous cooling trend permocarboniferous glaciation carboniferous rainforest collapse gondwana glaciated much situated around south pole
permian periodedit
main article permian




synapsid dimetrodon


permian spanned million years last period paleozoic beginning period continents joined together form supercontinent pangaea encircled ocean called panthalassa land mass time harsh seasons climate interior pangaea regulated large bodies water diapsids synapsids flourished climate creatures dimetrodon edaphosaurus ruled continent first conifers evolved dominated terrestrial landscape near permian however pangaea grew drier interior desert species scutosaurus gorgonopsids filled eventually disappeared along life earth cataclysm known great dying third severe mass extinction1314
tectonic activityedit
geologically paleozoic started shortly breakup supercontinent pannotia throughout early paleozoic landmass broken substantial number continents towards continents gathered together supercontinent called pangaea included earths land area
climateedit
earliest periods ordovician silurian warm greenhouse periods highest levels paleozoic todays warm climate interrupted million year cool period early palaeozoic icehouse culminating huronian glaciation million years ordovican15
early cambrian climate probably moderate first becoming warmer course cambrian secondgreatest sustained level rise phanerozoic underway however offset trend gondwana moved south ordovician time west gondwana africa south america directly south pole early paleozoic climate also strongly zonal result climate abstract sense became warmer living space organisms time—the continental shelf marine environment—became steadily colder however baltica northern europe russia laurentia eastern north america greenland remained tropical zone china australia waters least temperate early paleozoic ended rather abruptly short apparently severe late ordovician cold spell caused secondgreatest mass extinction phanerozoic time time warmer weather moved paleozoic
middle paleozoic time considerable stability levels dropped coincident slowly recovered course silurian devonian slow merger baltica laurentia northward movement bits pieces gondwana created numerous regions relatively warm shallow floor plants took hold continental margins oxygen levels increased carbon dioxide dropped although much less dramatically north–south temperature gradient also seems moderated metazoan life simply became hardier event southern continental margins antarctica west gondwana became increasingly less barren devonian ended series turnover pulses killed much middle paleozoic vertebrate life without noticeably reducing species diversity overall
many unanswered questions late paleozoic mississippian early carboniferous period began spike atmospheric oxygen carbon dioxide plummeted lows destabilized climate perhaps ages carboniferous severe brief late ordovician time effects world biota inconsequential cisuralian epoch oxygen carbon dioxide recovered normal levels hand assembly pangaea created huge arid inland areas subject temperature extremes lopingian epoch associated falling levels increased carbon dioxide general climatic deterioration culminating devastation permian extinction
floraedit




artists impression early land plants


macroscopic plant life appeared early paleozoic possibly late neoproterozoic earlier plants mostly remained aquatic sometime silurian devonian periods million years began transition onto land terrestrial flora reached climax carboniferous towering lycopsid rainforests dominated tropical belt euramerica climate change caused carboniferous rainforest collapse fragmented habitat diminishing diversity plant life late carboniferous permian16
faunaedit
noteworthy feature paleozoic life sudden appearance nearly invertebrate animal phyla great abundance beginning cambrian first vertebrates appeared form primitive fish greatly diversified silurian devonian periods first animals venture onto land arthropods fish lungs powerful bony fins late devonian 3675 million years allowed crawl onto land bones fins eventually evolved legs became first tetrapods million years began develop lungs amphibians dominant tetrapods midcarboniferous climate change greatly reduced diversity later reptiles prospered continued increase number variety late permian16
