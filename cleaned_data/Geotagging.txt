geotagging also written geotagging process adding geographical identification metadata various media geotagged photograph video websites messages codes1 feeds form geospatial metadata data usually consists latitude longitude coordinates though also include altitude bearing distance accuracy data place names perhaps time stamp
geotagging help users find wide variety locationspecific information device instance someone find images taken near given location entering latitude longitude coordinates suitable image search engine geotaggingenabled information services also potentially used find locationbased news websites resources2 geotagging tell users location content given picture media point view conversely media platforms show media relevant given location
related term geocoding refers process taking noncoordinate based geographical identifiers street address finding associated geographic coordinates vice versa reverse geocoding techniques used together geotagging provide alternative search techniques

first attempts initiate geotagging aspect searching locating articles seems nowinoperative site wikinearcom launched 2008 showed user wikipedia pages geographically closest ones current location17
2009 cyclopedia works relatively well showing geotagged wikipedia articles located within several miles ones location integrated streetview mode 360degree mode
respotter wiki launched 2009 claims feature wikipedia searching also allowing users interact people around messaging reviews current function however seems give geotagged photo results
2017 wikipediaworld project provides simple search tool display tagged articles near particular location well variety sophisticated tools integrated external mapping services
dangers geotaggingedit
following scientific study18 several demonstrative websites1920 discussion privacy implications geotagging raised public attention21222324 particular automatic embedding geotags pictures taken smartphones often ignored cellphone users result people often aware photos publish internet geotagged many celebrities reportedly gave away home location without knowing according study significant number forsale advertisements craigslist otherwise anonymized contained geotags thereby revealing location highvalued goods—sometimes combination clear hints absence offerer certain times publishing photos media tagged exact geolocation internet allows random people track individuals location correlate information therefore criminals could find homes empty inhabitants posted geotagged timestamped information home address vacation residence dangers avoided removing geotags metadata removal tool photos publishing internet2526
2007 four united states army apache helicopters destroyed ground iraqi insurgent mortar fire insurgents made embedded coordinates webpublished photographs geotagging taken helicopters soldiers27
another newly realised danger geotagging location information provided criminal gangs poachers whereabouts often endangered animals effectively make tourists scouts poachers geotagging turned photographing animals
