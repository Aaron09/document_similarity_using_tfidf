explaining levels genetic variationedit
neutral theory predicts level genetic diversity population proportional product population size neutral mutation rate fact levels genetic diversity vary much less population sizes known paradox variation66 high levels genetic diversity original arguments favor neutral theory paradox variation strongest arguments neutral theory

life history affects genetic diversity population history rstrategists genetic diversity67
detecting selectionedit
population genetics models used infer genes undergoing selection common approach look regions high linkage disequilibrium genetic variance along chromosome detect recent selective sweeps
second common approach mcdonald–kreitman test mcdonald–kreitman test compares amount variation within species polymorphism divergence species substitutions types sites assumed neutral typically synonymous sites assumed neutral70 genes undergoing positive selection excess divergent sites relative polymorphic sites test also obtain genomewide estimate proportion substitutions fixed positive selection α7172 according neutral theory molecular evolution number near zero high numbers therefore interpreted genomewide falsification neutral theory73

coalescent theory relates genetic diversity sample demographic history population taken normally assumes neutrality sequences neutrallyevolving portions genomes therefore selected analyses used infer relationships species phylogenetics population structure demographic history population bottlenecks population growth introgression within species
