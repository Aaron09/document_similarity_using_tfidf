lack phonemic nasalsedit
language claimed lack nasals altogether several niger–congo languagesnote pirahã language amazon nasal nonnasal prenasalized consonants usually alternate allophonically theoretical claim part individual linguist nasal basic form consonant case niger–congo languages example nasals occur nasal vowels since nasal vowels phonemic simplifies picture somewhat assume nasalization occlusives allophonic second step claiming nasal vowels nasalize oral occlusives rather oral vowels denasalizing nasal occlusives whether phonemically without full nasals without prenasalized stops postulating underlying oral prenasalized stops rather true nasals helps explain apparent instability nasal correspondences throughout niger–congo compared example indoeuropean3
