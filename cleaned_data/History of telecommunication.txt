ancient systems optical telegraphyedit

early telecommunications included smoke signals drums talking drums used natives africa guinea south america smoke signals north america china contrary might think systems often used merely announce presence military camp12
rabbinical judaism signal given means kerchiefs flags intervals along back high priest indicate goat azazel pushed cliff
homing pigeons occasionally used throughout history different cultures pigeon post persian roots later used romans military3
greek hydraulic semaphore systems used early century hydraulic semaphores worked water filled vessels visual signals functioned optical telegraphs however could utilize limited range predetermined messages optical telegraphs could deployed good visibility conditions4




code letters symbols chappe telegraph reess cyclopaedia


middle ages chains beacons commonly used hilltops means relaying signal beacon chains suffered drawback could pass single information meaning message enemy sighted agreed upon advance notable instance spanish armada beacon chain relayed signal plymouth london signaled arrival spanish warships5
french engineer claude chappe began working visual telegraphy 1790 using pairs clocks whose hands pointed different symbols prove quite viable long distances chappe revised model sets jointed wooden beams operators moved beams using cranks wires6 built first telegraph line lille paris followed line strasbourg paris 1794 swedish engineer abraham edelcrantz built quite different system stockholm drottningholm opposed chappes system involved pulleys rotating beams wood edelcrantzs system relied upon shutters therefore faster7
however semaphore communication system suffered need skilled operators expensive towers often intervals thirty kilometres nineteen miles result last commercial line abandoned 18808
