transcription first step gene expression particular segment copied especially mrna enzyme polymerase nucleic acids base pairs nucleotides complementary language transcription sequence read polymerase produces complementary antiparallel strand called primary transcript
transcription proceeds following general steps

polymerase together general transcription factors binds promoter
polymerase creates transcription bubble separates strands helix done breaking hydrogen bonds complementary nucleotides
polymerase adds nucleotides complementary nucleotides strand
sugarphosphate backbone forms assistance polymerase form strand
hydrogen bonds rna–dna helix break freeing newly synthesized strand
cell nucleus processed include polyadenylation capping splicing
