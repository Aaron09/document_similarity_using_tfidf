basic macroeconomic conceptsedit
macroeconomics encompasses variety concepts variables three central topics macroeconomic research3 macroeconomic theories usually relate phenomena output unemployment inflation outside macroeconomic theory topics also important economic agents including workers consumers producers




circulation macroeconomics


output incomeedit
national output total amount everything country produces given period time everything produced sold generates equal amount income therefore output income usually considered equivalent terms often used interchangeably output measured total income viewed production side measured total value final goods services value added economy4
macroeconomic output usually measured gross domestic product national accounts economists interested longrun increases output study economic growth advances technology accumulation machinery capital better education human capital factors lead increased economic output time however output always increase consistently business cycles cause shortterm drops output called recessions economists look macroeconomic policies prevent economies slipping recessions lead faster longterm growth
unemploymentedit
main article unemployment




chart using data showing relationship economic growth unemployment expressed okuns relationship demonstrates cyclical unemployment economic growth leads lower unemployment rate


amount unemployment economy measured unemployment rate percentage workers without jobs labor force unemployment rate labor force includes workers actively looking jobs people retired pursuing education discouraged seeking work lack prospects excluded
unemployment generally broken several types related different causes

classical unemployment theory suggests unemployment occurs wages high employers willing hire workerscitation needed modern economic theorieswhich suggest increased wages actually decrease unemployment creating consumer demand according recent theories unemployment results reduced demand goods services produced labor suggest markets profit margins market bear price increase product service higher wages result unemployment
consistent classical unemployment theory frictional unemployment occurs appropriate vacancies exist worker length time needed search find leads period unemployment5
structural unemployment covers variety possible causes unemployment including mismatch workers skills skills required open jobs6 large amounts structural unemployment occur economy transitioning industries workers find previous skills longer demand structural unemployment similar frictional unemployment reflect problem matching workers vacancies structural unemployment also covers time needed acquire skills addition short term search process7
types unemployment occur regardless condition economy cyclical unemployment occurs growth stagnates okuns represents empirical relationship unemployment economic growth8 original version okuns states increase output would lead decrease unemployment9

inflation deflationedit




tenyear moving averages changes price level growth money supply using measure supply hard currency money held types bank accounts 1875 2011 long series show close relationship


general price increase across entire economy called inflation prices decrease deflation economists measure changes prices price indexes inflation occur economy becomes overheated grows quickly similarly declining economy lead deflation
central bankers manage countrys money supply avoid changes price level using monetary policy raising interest rates reducing supply money economy reduce inflation inflation lead increased uncertainty negative consequences deflation lower economic output central bankers stabilize prices protect economies negative consequences price changes
changes price level result several factors quantity theory money holds changes price level directly related changes money supply economists believe relationship explains longrun changes price level10 shortrun fluctuations also related monetary factors changes aggregate demand aggregate supply also influence price level example decrease demand recession lead lower price levels deflation negative supply shock crisis lowers aggregate supply cause inflation
macroeconomic modelsedit
aggregate demand–aggregate supplyedit




traditional as–ad diagram showing shift curve becoming inelastic beyond potential output


adas model become standard textbook model explaining macroeconomy11 model shows price level level real output given equilibrium aggregate demand aggregate supply aggregate demand curves downward slope means output demanded lower price levels12 downward slope result three effects pigou real balance effect states real prices fall real wealth increases resulting higher consumer demand goods keynes interest rate effect states prices fall demand money decreases causing interest rates decline borrowing investment consumption increase export effect states prices rise domestic goods become comparatively expensive foreign consumers leading decline exports12
conventional keynesian asad model aggregate supply curve horizontal levels output becomes inelastic near point potential output corresponds full employment11 since economy cannot produce beyond potential output expansion lead higher price levels instead higher output
ad–as diagram model variety macroeconomic phenomena including inflation changes nonprice level factors determinants cause changes aggregate demand shifts entire aggregate demand curve demand goods exceeds supply inflationary demandpull inflation occurs curve shifts upward higher price level economy faces higher costs costpush inflation occurs curve shifts upward higher price levels13 as–ad diagram also widely used pedagogical tool model effects various macroeconomic policies14
is–lmedit




example islm chart curve moves right causing higher interest rates expansion real economy real


is–lm model represents combinations interest rates output ensure equilibrium goods money markets15 goods market represented equilibrium investment saving money market represented equilibrium money supply liquidity preference16 curve consists points investment given interest rate equal savings given output17
curve downward sloping output interest rate inverse relationship goods market output increases money saved means interest rates must lower spur enough investment match savings17 curve upward sloping interest rate output positive relationship money market output increases demand money increases resulting rise interest rate18
islm model often used demonstrate effects monetary fiscal policy15 textbooks frequently islm model feature complexities modern macroeconomic models15 nevertheless models still feature similar relationships islm15
growth modelsedit
neoclassical growth model robert solow become common textbook model explaining economic growth longruncitation needed model begins production function national output product inputs capital labor solow model assumes labor capital used constant rates without fluctuations unemployment capital utilization commonly seen business cycles19
increase output economic growth occur increase capital stock larger population technological advancements lead higher productivity total factor productivity increase savings rate leads temporary increase economy creates capital adds output however eventually depreciation rate limit expansion capital savings used replacing depreciated capital savings remain additional expansion capital solows model suggests economic growth terms output capita depends solely technological advances enhance productivity20
1980s 1990s endogenous growth theory arose challenge neoclassical growth theory group models explains economic growth factors increasing returns scale capital learningbydoing endogenously determined instead exogenous technological improvement used explain growth solows model21
macroeconomic policyedit
macroeconomic policy usually implemented sets tools fiscal monetary policy forms policy used stabilize economy mean boosting economy level consistent full employment22 macroeconomic policy focuses limiting effects business cycle achieve economic goals price stability full employment growth
monetary policyedit
information monetary policy
central banks implement monetary policy controlling money supply several mechanisms typically central banks take action issuing money bonds assets boosts supply money lowers interest rates case contractionary monetary policy banks sell bonds take money circulation usually policy implemented directly targeting supply money
central banks continuously shift money supply maintain targeted fixed interest rate allow interest rate fluctuate focus targeting inflation rates instead central banks generally achieve high output without letting loose monetary policy create large amounts inflation
conventional monetary policy ineffective situations liquidity trap interest rates inflation near zero central bank cannot loosen monetary policy conventional means




example intervention strategy different conditions


central banks unconventional monetary policy quantitative easing help increase output instead buying government bonds central banks implement quantitative easing buying government bonds also assets corporate bonds stocks securities allows lower interest rates broader class assets beyond government bonds another example unconventional monetary policy united states federal reserve recently made attempt policy operation twist unable lower current interest rates federal reserve lowered longterm interest rates buying longterm bonds selling shortterm bonds create flat yield curve
fiscal policyedit
information fiscal policy
fiscal policy governments revenue expenditure instruments influence economy examples tools expenditure taxes debt
example economy producing less potential output government spending used employ idle resources boost output government spending make entire output multiplier effect boosts impact government spending instance government pays bridge project adds value bridge output also allows bridge workers increase consumption investment helps close output
effects fiscal policy limited crowding government takes spending projects limits amount resources available private sector crowding occurs government spending simply replaces private sector output instead adding additional output economy crowding also occurs government spending raises interest rates limits investment defenders fiscal stimulus argue crowding concern economy depressed plenty resources left idle interest rates lowcitation needed
fiscal policy implemented automatic stabilizers automatic stabilizers suffer policy lags discretionary fiscal policy automatic stabilizers conventional fiscal mechanisms take effect soon economy takes downturn spending unemployment benefits automatically increases unemployment rises progressive income system effective rate automatically falls incomes decline
comparisonedit
economists usually favor monetary fiscal policy major advantages first monetary policy generally implemented independent central banks instead political institutions control fiscal policy independent central banks less likely make decisions based political motives22 second monetary policy suffers shorter inside lags outside lags fiscal policy central banks quickly make implement decisions discretionary fiscal policy take time pass even longer carry out22

typical view quantity theory money velocity quantity goods produced would constant increase money supply would lead direct increase price level quantity theory money central part classical theory economy prevailed early twentieth century
austrian schooledit
ludwig misess work theory money credit published 1912 first books austrian school deal macroeconomic topics
keynes followersedit
macroeconomics least modern form25 began publication john maynard keyness general theory employment interest money2426 great depression struck classical economists difficulty explaining goods could unsold workers could left unemployed classical theory prices wages would drop market cleared goods labor sold keynes offered theory economics explained markets might clear would evolve later 20th century group macroeconomic schools thought known keynesian economics also called keynesianism keynesian theory
keyness theory quantity theory broke people businesses tend hold cash tough economic times phenomenon described terms liquidity preferences keynes also explained multiplier effect would magnify small decrease consumption investment cause declines throughout economy keynes also noted role uncertainty animal spirits play economy25
generation following keynes combined macroeconomics general theory neoclassical microeconomics create neoclassical synthesis 1950s economists accepted synthesis view macroeconomy25 economists like paul samuelson franco modigliani james tobin robert solow developed formal keynesian models contributed formal theories consumption investment money demand fleshed keynesian framework27
monetarismedit
milton friedman updated quantity theory money include role money demand argued role money economy sufficient explain great depression aggregate demand oriented explanations necessary friedman also argued monetary policy effective fiscal policy however friedman doubted governments ability finetune economy monetary policy generally favored policy steady growth money supply instead frequent intervention28
friedman also challenged phillips curve relationship inflation unemployment friedman edmund phelps monetarist proposed augmented version phillips curve excluded possibility stable longrun tradeoff inflation unemploymentcitation needed shocks 1970s created high unemployment high inflation friedman phelps vindicated monetarism particularly influential early 1980s monetarism fell favor central banks found difficult target money supply instead interest rates monetarists recommended monetarism also became politically unpopular central banks created recessions order slow inflation
classicaledit
classical macroeconomics challenged keynesian school central development classical thought came robert lucas introduced rational expectations macroeconomics prior lucas economists generally used adaptive expectations agents assumed look recent past make expectations future rational expectations agents assumed sophisticated consumer simply assume inflation rate average past years look current monetary policy economic conditions make informed forecast classical economists introduced rational expectations models showed monetary policy could limited impact
lucas also made influential critique keynesian empirical models argued forecasting models based empirical relationships would keep producing predictions even underlying model generating data changed advocated models based fundamental economic theory would principle structurally accurate economies changed following lucass critique classical economists edward prescott finn kydland created real business cycle models macroeconomy29
models created combining fundamental equations neoclassical microeconomics order generate macroeconomic fluctuations models explained recessions unemployment changes technology instead changes markets goods money critics models argue money clearly plays important role economy idea technological regress explain recent recessions implausible29 however technological shocks prominent myriad possible shocks system modeled despite questions theory behind models clearly influential economic methodologycitation needed
keynesian responseedit
keynesian economists responded classical school adopting rational expectations focusing developing microfounded models immune lucas critique stanley fischer john taylor produced early work area showing monetary policy could effective even models rational expectations contracts locked wages workers keynesian economists including olivier blanchard julio rotemberg greg mankiw david romer michael woodford expanded work demonstrated cases inflexible prices wages monetary fiscal policy real effects
like classical models classical models assumed prices would able adjust perfectly monetary policy would lead price changes keynesian models investigated sources sticky prices wages imperfect competition30 would adjust allowing monetary policy impact quantities instead prices
late 1990s economists reached rough consensus nominal rigidity keynesian theory combined rational expectations methodology produce dynamic stochastic general equilibrium dsge models fusion elements different schools thought dubbed neoclassical synthesis models used many central banks core part contemporary macroeconomics31
keynesian economics developed partly response classical economics strives provide microeconomic foundations keynesian economics showing imperfect markets justify demand management
