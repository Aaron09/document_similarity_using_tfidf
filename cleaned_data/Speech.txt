productionedit
main articles speech production linguistics
speech production multistep process thoughts generated spoken utterances production involves selection appropriate words appropriate form words lexicon morphology organization words syntax phonetic properties words retrieved sentence uttered articulations associated phonetic properties1
linguistics articulatory phonetics articulation refers tongue lips vocal cords speech organs used produce sounds used make sounds speech sounds categorized manner articulation place articulation place articulation refers airstream mouth constricted manner articulation refers manner speech organs interact closely restricted form airstream used pulmonic implosive ejectives clicks whether vocal cords vibrating whether nasal cavity opened airstream2 concept primarily used production consonants used vowels qualities voicing nasalization place articulation several manners articulation therefore several homorganic consonants
normal human speech pulmonic produced pressure lungs creates phonation glottis larynx modified vocal tract mouth different vowels consonants however humans pronounce words without lungs glottis alaryngeal speech three types esophageal speech pharyngeal speech buccal speech better known donald duck talk
speech errorsedit
main article speech error
speech production complex activity consequence errors common especially children speech errors come many forms often used provide evidence support hypotheses nature speech3 result speech errors often used construction models language production child language acquisition example fact children often make error overregularizing past tense suffix english saying singed instead sang shows regular forms acquired earlier45 speech errors associated certain kinds aphasia used certain components speech onto brain relation different aspects production example difficulty expressive aphasia patients producing regular pasttense verbs irregulars like singsang used demonstrate regular inflected forms word individually stored lexicon produced affixation base form6
perceptionedit
main article speech perception
speech perception refers processes humans interpret understand sounds used language study speech perception closely linked fields phonetics phonology linguistics cognitive psychology perception psychology research speech perception seeks understand listeners recognize speech sounds information understand spoken language research speech perception also applications building computer systems recognize speech well improving speech recognition hearing languageimpaired listeners7
speech perception categorical people sounds hear categories rather perceiving spectrum people likely able hear differences sounds across categorical boundaries within good example voice onset time example hebrew speakers distinguish voiced voiceless easily detect change perceived perceived change despite equally large change spectrum8
repetitionedit
main article speech repetition
speech repetition speech heard quickly turned sensory input motor instructions needed immediate delayed vocal imitation phonological memory type mapping plays role enabling children expand spoken vocabulary masur 1995 found often children repeat novel words versus already lexicon related size lexicon later young children repeat novel words larger lexicon later development speech repetition could help facilitate acquisition larger lexicon9
problems involving speechedit
also speechlanguage pathology
several organic psychological factors affect speech among

diseases disorders lungs vocal cords including paralysis respiratory infections bronchitis vocal fold nodules cancers lungs throat
diseases disorders brain including alogia aphasias dysarthria dystonia speech processing disorders impaired motor planning nerve transmission phonological processing perception message opposed actual sound leads poor speech production
hearing problems otitis media effusion listening problems auditory processing disorders lead phonological problems
articulatory problems slurred speech stuttering lisping cleft palate ataxia nerve damage leading problems articulation tourette syndrome tics also affect speech various congenital acquired tongue diseases affect speech motor neuron disease
addition dysphasia anomia auditory processing disorder impede quality auditory perception therefore expression hard hearing deaf considered fall category
