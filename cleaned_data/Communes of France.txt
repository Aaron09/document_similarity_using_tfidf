surface area typical communeedit
metropolitan france average area commune 2004 1488 square kilometres median area metropolitan frances communes 1999 census even smaller 1073 square kilometres median area better measure area typical french commune
median area smaller european countries italy median area communes comuni belgium spain germany majority länder communes gemeinden median area switzerland länder rhinelandpalatinate schleswigholstein thuringia germany places europe communes smaller median area france
communes frances overseas départements réunion french guiana large french standards usually group commune several villages towns often sizeable distances among réunion demographic expansion sprawling urbanization resulted administrative splitting communes
population typical communeedit
median population metropolitan frances communes 1999 census inhabitants small number france stands absolutely apart europe lowest communes median population european countries communes switzerland rhinelandpalatinate smaller surface area mentioned populated small median population french communes compared italy median population communes 2001 2343 inhabitants belgium 11265 inhabitants even spain inhabitants
median population given hide fact pronounced differences size french communes mentioned introduction commune city million inhabitants paris town 10000 inhabitants hamlet inhabitants median population tells vast majority french communes hundred inhabitants also small number communes within much higher populations
metropolitan france percent percent 36569 communes fewer inhabitants 4638000 inhabitants smaller communes constitute percent percent total population words percent french population live percent communes whilst percent concentrated remaining percent
example alsaceedit
alsace area 8280 3200 part région grand used smallest regions metropolitan france still fewer communes high number typical metropolitan france atypical compared european countries shows distinctive nature french commune geopolitical administrative entity
communes alsace three times many municipalities sweden much larger territory covering 449964 173732 divided municipalities kommuner alsace double total number municipalities netherlands spite population nine times larger land area four times larger alsace divided municipalities gemeenten
communes alsace along regions france rejected central governments calls mergers rationalization contrast german states bordering alsace geopolitical administrative areas subject various reorganizations 1960s onward state badenwürttemberg number gemeinden communities reduced 3378 19684 1108 september 20075 comparison number communes alsace reduced 197167 marcellin aimed encouraging french communes merge passed current debate section january 2007 consequently alsace region despite land area onefifth size total population onesixth neighbor badenwürttemberg almost many municipalities small alsace region double number municipalities compared large populous state north rhinewestphalia gemeinden september 2007
status communesedit
despite enormous differences population communes french republic possess mayor maire municipal council conseil municipal jointly manage commune city hall mairie exactly powers matter size commune city paris exception local police hands central state mayor paris uniformity status legacy french revolution wanted away local idiosyncrasies tremendous differences status existed kingdom france
french makes allowances vast differences commune size number areas administrative size municipal council method electing municipal council maximum allowable mayor deputy mayors municipal campaign finance limits among features depend population echelon particular commune falls
since 1982 three french communes also special status divided municipal arrondissements paris marseille lyon municipal arrondissement administrative unit commune french republic existing three communes municipal arrondissements confused arrondissements subdivisions french départements french communes considered legal entities whereas municipal arrondissements contrast official capacity budget
rights obligations communes governed code général collectivités territoriales cgct replaced code communes except personnel matters passage february 1996 legislation decree number 2000318 april 2000 regulations89
1794 1977—except months 1848 18701871—paris mayor thus directly controlled departmental prefect meant paris less autonomy smallest village
history french communesedit
french communes created beginning french revolution 17891790
kingdom franceedit
parishesedit
revolution frances lowest level administrative division parish paroisse 60000 kingdom parish essentially church houses around known village cultivated land around village france populous country europe time population approximately million inhabitants late 18th century england contrast million inhabitants accounts large number parishes french kings often prided ruling realm 100000 steeples
parishes lacked municipal structures postrevolution communes usually contained building committee conseil fabrique made villagers managed buildings parish church churchyard numerous church estates properties sometimes also provided help poor even administered parish hospitals schools since ordinance villerscotterêts 1539 francis priest charge parish also required record baptisms marriages burials except tasks villages left handle issues pleased typically villagers would gather decide special issue regarding community agricultural land usage existed permanent municipal body many places local feudal lord seigneur still major influence village’s affairs collecting taxes tenantvillagers ordering work corvée controlling fields used much harvest given
chartered citiesedit
additionally cities obtained charters middle ages either king local counts dukes city toulouse chartered counts toulouse cities made several parishes parishes case paris usually enclosed defensive wall emancipated power feudal lords 12th 13th centuries municipal bodies administered city bore resemblance communes french revolution would establish except points

municipal bodies democratic usually hands rich bourgeois families upon time nobility conferred better labeled oligarchies rather municipal democracies
uniform status chartered cities status specific organization

north cities tended administered échevins germanic word meaning judge south cities tended administered consuls clear reference roman antiquity bordeaux administered jurats etymologically meaning sworn toulouse capitouls chapter usually mayor modern sense échevins consuls equal footing rendered decisions collegially however certain purposes échevin consul ranking others sort mayor although authority executive powers modern mayor mayor called provost merchants prévôt marchands paris lyon maire marseille bordeaux rouen orléans bayonne many cities towns mayeur lille premier capitoul toulouse viguier montpellier premier consul many towns southern france prêteur royal strasbourg maître échevin metz maire royal nancy prévôt valenciennes
french revolutionedit
july 1789 afternoon following storming bastille provost merchants paris jacques flesselles shot crowd steps paris city hall although middle ages provosts merchants symbolized independence paris even openly rebelled king charles office suppressed king reinstated strict control king ended viewed people another representative king longer embodiment free municipality
following event commune paris immediately replace medieval chartered city paris municipal guard established protect paris attempt made king louis quell ongoing revolution several cities france quickly followed suit communes arose everywhere municipal guard december 1789 national assembly assemblée nationale passed creating commune designed lowest level administrative division france thus endorsing independently created communes also creating communes area many others work national assembly properly speaking revolutionary content transforming chartered cities towns communes national assembly also decided turn village parishes fullstatus communes revolutionaries inspired cartesian ideas well philosophy enlightenment wanted away peculiarities past establish perfect society everything equal according reason rather tradition conservatism
thus establish administrative divisions would uniform across country whole france would divided départements divided arrondissements divided cantons divided communes exceptions communes would equal status would mayor head municipal council elected inhabitants commune real revolution thousands villages never experienced organized municipal life communal house built villages would house meetings municipal council well administration commune national assembly opposed fragmentation france thousands communes eventually mirabeau ideas commune parish prevailed
september 1792 recording births marriages deaths also withdrawn responsibility priests parishes handed mayors civil marriages established started performed mairie ceremony unlike traditional mayor replacing priest name replacing name vous déclare unis liens mariage name declare united bonds marriage priests forced surrender centuriesold baptism marriage burial books deposited mairies abrupt changes profoundly alienated devout catholics france soon plunged throes civil fervently religious regions western france center would take napoleon reestablish peace france stabilize administrative system make generally accepted population napoleon also abolished election municipal councils chosen prefect local representative central government
trends french revolutionedit
today french communes still much general principles established beginning revolution biggest changes occurred 1831 french parliament reestablished principle election municipal councils 1837 french communes given legal personality considered legal entities legal capacity jacobin revolutionaries afraid independent local powers conservative opposed revolution favored powerful central state therefore created communes deprived legal personality départements central state legal personality 1837 situation judged impractical mayors municipal councils could parties courts consequence change however tens thousands villages never legal personality contrary chartered cities suddenly became legal entities first time history still case today
revolution approximately 41000 communes created10 territory corresponding limits modernday france 41000 figure includes communes departments savoie hautesavoie alpesmaritimes annexed 1795 include departments modernday belgium germany west rhine part france 1795 1815 fewer 60000 parishes existed revolution cities towns parishes merged single commune countryside small parishes merged bigger ones 41000 still considerable number without comparison world time except empire china county level permanent administration
since tremendous changes affected france rest europe industrial revolution world wars rural exodus depopulated countryside increased size cities french administrative divisions however remained extremely rigid unchanged today percent communes departments exactly designed time french revolution years limits countless rural communes hundreds inhabitants time french revolution hundred inhabitants fewer hand cities towns grown much urbanized area extending beyond limits commune time revolution extreme example paris urbanized area sprawls communes
paris fact communes france whose limits extended take account expansion urbanized area larger commune paris oversight emperor napoléon 1859 1859 limits paris rigidified unlike european countries stringently merged communes better reflect modernday densities population germany italy around 1970 dramatically decreasing number communes process gemeinden west germany decreased 24400 8400 space years france carried mergers margin mostly carried 19th century 41000 communes time french revolution number decreased 37963 1921 36569 2008 metropolitan france
thus europe switzerland high density communes france even extensive merger movement started last years better grasp staggering number communes france comparisons made first original member states european union approximately 75000 communes france alone comprises percent population eu15 nearly half communes second united states territory fourteen times larger french republic nearly five times population 35937 incorporated municipalities townships 2002 census governments fewer french republic
current debateedit
long calls france massive merger communes including distinguished voices president cour comptes central auditing administrative body france however local conservatism strong mandatory merging proposal ever made past committee french parliament 1971 marcellin offered support money government entice communes merge freely limited effect 1300 communes agreed merge others many rural communes residents struggle maintain manage basic services running water garbage collection properly paved communal roads
mergers however easy achieve problem mergers reduce number available elected positions thus popular local politicians moreover citizens village unwilling local services executive located another village consider unaware inattentive local needs
intercommunalityedit
expression intercommunality intercommunalité denotes several forms cooperation communes cooperation first made appearance 19th century form march 1890 provided establishment singlepurpose intercommunal associations french lawmakers long aware inadequacy communal structure inherited french revolution dealing number practical matters socalled chevènement july 1999 recent thoroughgoing measure aimed strengthening simplifying principle
recent years become increasingly common communes band together intercommunal consortia provision services refuse collection water supply suburban communes often team city core urban area form community charged managing public transport even administering collection local taxes
chevènement tidied practices abolishing structures creating ones addition offered central government finance aimed encouraging communes join together intercommunal structures unlike partially successful statute enacted 1966 enabling urban communes form urban communities marked failure marcellin 1971 chevènement large measure success majority french communes involved intercommunal structures
types structures

without fiscal power loosest form intercommunality mainly category traditional syndicates communes communes gather contribute financially syndicate syndicate cannot levy taxes communes leave syndicate time syndicates particular purpose deal several simultaneous matters structures left untouched chevènement decline
structures fiscal power chevènement concerned distinguished three structures fiscal power

community communes communauté communes aimed primarily rural communes
community agglomeration communauté dagglomération aimed towns middlesized cities suburbs
urban community communauté urbaine aimed larger cities suburbs
metropolis métropole established 2014 aimed largest cities suburbs




three structures given varying levels fiscal power community agglomeration urban community fiscal power levying local corporations taxe professionnelle name instead communes level taxation across communes community communities must also manage services previously performed communes garbage collection transport also makes mandatory communities manage areas economic planning development housing projects environment protection communities communes required manage least number areas leaving communes autonomous urban communities required manage matters leaving communes within less autonomy

allocation government moneyedit
exchange creation community government allocates money based population thus providing incentive communes team form communities communities communes given least amount money inhabitant whereas urban communities given amount money inhabitant thus pushing communes form integrated communities fewer powers might otherwise loath government money
chevènement extremely successful sense majority french communes joined intercommunal structures january 2007 2573 communities metropolitan france including five syndicats dagglomération nouvelle category currently phased made 33327 communes percent communes metropolitan france 5286 million inhabitants percent population metropolitan france11
impressive results however hide murkier reality rural areas many communes entered community communes benefit government funds often local syndicate turned officially community communes community communes fact managing services previously managed syndicate contrary spirit established intercommunal structures carry much broader range activities undertaken syndicates government money transfers stopped many communities communes would revert former status syndicate simply completely disappear places syndicates prior lawcitation needed
urban areas intercommunal structures much reality created local decisionmakers genuine belief worth working together however many places local feuds arisen possible intercommunal structure whole urban area communes refusing take part even creating structure urban areas like marseille exist four distinct intercommunal structures many areas rich communes joined rich communes refused poorer communes fear citizens would overtaxed benefit poorer suburbscitation needed
moreover intercommunal structures many urban areas still fragile tensions exist communes city center urban area often suspected wishing dominate suburban communes communes opposing political sides also suspicious othercitation needed
famous examples toulouse paris toulouse intercommunal structures main community toulouse suburbs community agglomeration although toulouse large enough create urban community according suburban communes refused urban community fear losing much power opted community agglomeration despite fact community agglomeration receives less government funds urban community paris intercommunal structure emerged suburbs paris fearing concept greater paris disunity still rule metropolitan area suburbs paris creating many different intercommunal structures without citycitation needed
major often raised problem intercommunality fact intercommunal structures subject directly election people representatives individual commune structure consequence civil servants bureaucrats ones setting agenda implementing elected representatives communes endorsing decisionscitation needed
