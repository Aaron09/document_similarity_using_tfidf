phonetic realizationedit
various ways stress manifests speech stream depend extent language spoken stressed syllables often louder nonstressed syllables higher lower pitch also sometimes pronounced longer sometimes differences place manner articulation particular vowels unstressed syllables central neutral articulation stressed syllables peripheral articulation stress realized varying degrees different words sentence sometimes difference acoustic signals stressed unstressed syllables minimal
particular distinguishing features stress types prominence particular features dominant sometimes referred particular types accent dynamic accent case loudness pitch accent case pitch although term usually specialized meanings quantitative accent case length1 qualitative accent case differences articulation compared various types accent music theory contexts term stress stress accent used mean specifically dynamic accent antonym pitch accent various meanings
prominent syllable word said accented tonic latter term imply carries phonemic tone syllables words said unaccented atonic syllables frequently said pretonic posttonic position certain phonological rules apply specifically positions instance american english flapped posttonic position
mandarin chinese tone language stressed syllables found tones realized relatively large swing fundamental frequency unstressed syllables typically smaller swings2 also stress standard chinese
stressed syllables often perceived forceful nonstressed syllables research shown however although dynamic accent accompanied greater respiratory force mean forceful articulation vocal tractcitation needed
lexical stressedit
lexical stress word stress stress placed given syllable word position lexical stress word depend certain general rules applicable language dialect question languages must learned word largely unpredictable
languages position stress usually predicted simple rule said fixed stress example czech finnish icelandic hungarian stress almost always comes first syllable word armenian stress last syllable word3 quechua polish stress almost always penult secondlast syllable macedonian antepenult thirdlast syllable
languages stress placed different syllables predictable classical arabic latin whose stress conditioned structure penult said regular stress rule
statements position stress sometimes affected fact word spoken isolation prosodic factors come play apply word spoken normally within sentence french words sometimes said stressed final syllable attributed prosodic stress placed last syllable unless schwa secondlast string words language thus last syllable word analyzed isolation situation similar standard chinese french authors chinese4 considered real lexical stress
languages position stress word less predictable said variable stress like english russian italian portuguese spanish stress usually truly lexical must memorized part pronunciation individual word languages spanish portuguese extent italian stress even represented writing using diacritical marks example spanish words célebre celebré russian diacritical marks sometimes written people learning language whether first second language
languages variable stress stress phonemic serve distinguish otherwise identical words example english words insight incite distinguished pronunciation fact stress falls first syllable former second syllable latter examples include umschreiben rewrite umschreiben paraphrase outline german земли́ genitive earth land зе́мли plural earth land russian ancora anchor ancora still italian triple example sábia wise woman sabia heshe knew sabiá true thrush portuguese english compound nouns change meaning based stress paper made paper páper carrying newspapers
dialects language different stress placement instance english word laboratory stressed second syllable british english labóratory often pronounced labóratry second silent first syllable american english secondary stress syllable láboratory often pronounced lábratory spanish word video stressed first syllable spain vídeo second syllable americas vidéo portuguese words madagascar continent oceania stressed third syllable european portuguese madagáscar oceânia fourth syllable brazilian portuguese madagascár oceanía
levels stressedit
main article secondary stress
languages described primary stress secondary stress syllable secondary stress stressed relative unstressed syllables strongly syllable primary stress primary stress position secondary stress less predictable depending language english fully predictable words organization accumulation primary stress fourth syllable secondary stress comes first syllable former word second syllable latter analyses example found chomsky halles sound pattern english english described four levels stress primary secondary tertiary quaternary treatments often disagree another
peter ladefoged phoneticians noted possible describe english degree stress long unstressed syllables phonemically distinguished vowel reduction5 believe multiple levels posited english whether primary–secondary primary–secondary–tertiary mere phonetic detail true phonemic stress often alleged secondary stress characterized increase respiratory activity normally associated primary stress english stress languages detail stress vowel reduction english
prosodic stressedit


extra stress





prosodic stress sentence stress refers stress patterns apply higher level individual word namely within prosodic unit involve certain natural stress pattern characteristic given language also involve placing emphasis particular words relative importance contrastive stress
example natural prosodic stress pattern described french stress placed final syllable string words schwa nexttofinal syllable similar pattern claimed english levels stress traditional distinction lexical primary secondary stress replaced partly prosodic rule stating final stressed syllable phrase given additional stress word spoken alone becomes phrase hence prosodic stress appear lexical pronunciation words analyzed standalone context rather within phrases
another type prosodic stress pattern quantity sensitivity languages additional stress tends placed syllables longer moraically heavy
prosodic stress also often used pragmatically emphasize focus attention particular words ideas associated change clarify meaning sentence example


didnt take test yesterday somebody else
didnt take test yesterday take
didnt take test yesterday something else
didnt take test yesterday took different
didnt take test yesterday took something else
didnt take test yesterday took


examples stress normally transcribed italics printed text underlining handwriting
english stress dramatically realized focused accented words instance consider dialogue


brunch tomorrow
dinner tomorrow


stressrelated acoustic differences syllables tomorrow would small compared differences syllables dinner emphasized word emphasized words stressed syllables dinner louder longer678 also different fundamental frequency properties
main stress within sentence often found last stressed word called nuclear stress9
stress vowel reductionedit
many languages russian english vowel reduction occur vowel changes stressed unstressed position english unstressed vowels reduce schwalike vowels though details vary dialect stress vowel reduction english effect dependent lexical stress example unstressed first syllable word photographer contains schwa fəˈtɒɡrəfər whereas stressed first syllable photograph ˈfoʊtəˌgræf grɑːf prosodic stress example word pronounced schwa unstressed within sentence stressed
many languages finnish mainstream dialects spanish unstressed vowel reduction languages vowels unstressed syllables nearly quality stressed syllables
stress rhythmedit
languages english said stresstimed languages stressed syllables appear roughly constant rate nonstressed syllables shortened accommodate contrasts languages syllable timing spanish mora timing japanese syllables moras spoken roughly constant rate regardless stress details isochrony
historical effects stressedit
common stressed unstressed syllables behave differently language evolves example romance languages original latin short vowels often become diphthongs stressed since stress takes part verb conjugation produced verbs vowel alternation romance languages example spanish verb volver form volví past tense vuelvo present tense spanish irregular verbs italian shows phenomenon alternating instead behavior confined verbs note example spanish viento wind latin ventum italian fuoco fire latin focum
stress deafnessedit
operational definition word stress provided stress deafness paradigm10 idea listeners perform poorly reproducing presentation order series stimuli minimally differ position phonetic prominence núminumí language doesnt word stress task involves reproduction order stimuli sequence strokes whereby associated stress location númi numí trial stimuli length thus order núminúminumínúmi reproduced 1121 found listeners whose native language french performed significantly worse spanish listeners reproducing stress patterns strokes explanation spanish lexically contrastive stress evidenced minimal pairs like tópo mole topó “met” french stress convey lexical information equivalent stress minimal pairs spanish
spelling notation stressedit
orthographies languages include devices indicating position lexical stress examples listed

modern greek polysyllables written acute accent vowel stressed syllable acute accent also used monosyllables order distinguish homographs stress words
spanish orthography stress written explicitly single acute accent vowel stressed antepenultimate syllables always written accent mark árabe last syllable stressed accent mark used word ends letters vowel está penultimate syllable stressed accent used word ends letter cárcel word written without accent mark stress penult last letter vowel final syllable word ends letter however greek acute accent also used words distinguish various syntactical uses form pronoun dónde pronoun whcomplement donde adverb information stress spanish
portuguese stress sometimes indicated explicitly acute accent open circumflex close orthography extensive rules describe placement diacritics based position stressed syllable surrounding letters
italian graphic accent needed words ending accented vowel città city monosyllabic words might otherwise confused words like optional written vowel possibility misunderstanding condomìni condominiums condòmini joint owners italian alphabet diacritics

though part normal orthography number devices exist used linguists others indicate position stress syllabification cases desirable listed

international phonetic alphabet primary stress indicated high vertical line stressed element secondary stress vertical line example sɪˌlæbəfɪˈkeɪʃən sɪˌlæbəfɪˈkeɪʃən extra stress indicated doubling symbol commonly stress mark placed beginning stressed syllable syllable definable however occasionally placed immediately vowel11
linguists frequently mark primary stress acute accent vowel secondary stress grave accent example sɪlæ̀bəfɪkéɪʃən sɪlæ̀bəfɪkéɪʃən advantage require decision syllable boundaries
english dictionaries show pronunciation respelling stress typically marked prime mark placed stressed syllable silab′əfikay′shən
pronunciation guides stress often indicated using combination bold text capital letters example silabifikayshun silabifikayshun
russian ukrainian dictionaries stress indicated acute accent syllables vowel example вимовля́ння editions apostrophe12 example гласная stressing rare general texts still used necessary compare за́мок castle замо́к lock stress marks generally used materials foreign learners language
