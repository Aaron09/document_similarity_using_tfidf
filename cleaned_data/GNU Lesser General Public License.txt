differences gpledit
main difference lgpl latter allows work linked case library used nonlgpled program regardless whether free software proprietary software1 nonlgpled program distributed terms derivative work derivative work programs terms must allow modification customers reverse engineering debugging modifications whether work uses lgpl program derivative work legal issue standalone executable dynamically links library similar medium generally accepted derivative work defined lgpl would fall definition work uses library paragraph lgpl version states

program contains derivative portion library designed work library compiled linked called work uses library work isolation derivative work library therefore falls outside scope license

essentially work uses library must possible software linked newer version lgplcovered program commonly used method suitable shared library mechanism linking alternatively statically linked library allowed either source code linkable object files provided2
compatibilityedit

lgpl librariesedit
former name library general public license gave impression recommended software libraries lgpl programs february 1999 project leader richard stallman wrote essay shouldnt lesser next library explaining lgpl deprecated necessarily lgpl libraries

license best given library matter strategy using ordinary library gives free software developers advantage proprietary developers library proprietary developers cannot free librarys features readily available proprietary software alternative libraries library cannot give free software particular advantage better lesser library1

stallman sometimes advocate licenses even less restrictive lgpl matter strategy prominent example stallmans endorsement bsdstyle license vorbis project libraries5
programming language specificationsedit
license uses terminology mainly intended applications written programming language family franz published preamble license clarify terminology lisp context lgpl preamble sometimes referred llgpl6
addition special feature generics prompt gnat modified general public license allows code link instantiate gmgplcovered units without code becoming covered
templates headeronly libraries problem generics version lgpl addresses cases section
class inheritanceedit
concern risen suitability objectoriented classes lgpld inherited nonlgpl code clarification given official website

lgpl contain special provisions inheritance none needed inheritance creates derivative works traditional linking lgpl permits type derivative work permits ordinary function calls8
