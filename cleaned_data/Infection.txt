classificationedit
subclinical versus clinical latent versus apparentedit
symptomatic infections apparent clinical whereas infection active produce noticeable symptoms called inapparent silent subclinical occult infection inactive dormant called latent infection6 example latent bacterial infection latent tuberculosis viral infections also latent examples latent viral infections herpesviridae family
word infection denote presence particular pathogen matter little also often used sense implying clinically apparent infection words case infectious disease7 fact occasionally creates ambiguity prompts usage discussion around usage annoyance common health professionals speak colonization rather infection mean pathogens present clinically apparent infection disease present
shortterm infection acute infection longterm infection chronic infection infections classified causative agent bacterial viral fungal parasitic presence absence systemic symptoms sepsis
primary versus opportunisticedit
among many varieties microorganisms relatively cause disease otherwise healthy individuals8 infectious disease results interplay pathogens defenses hosts infect appearance severity disease resulting pathogen depends upon ability pathogen damage host well ability host resist pathogen however hosts immune system also cause damage host attempt control infection clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms microbes according status host defenses either primary pathogens opportunistic pathogens

primary pathogens
primary pathogens cause disease result presence activity within normal healthy host intrinsic virulence severity disease cause part necessary consequence need reproduce spread many common primary pathogens humans infect humans however many serious diseases caused organisms acquired environment infect nonhuman hosts
opportunistic pathogens
opportunistic pathogens cause infectious disease host depressed resistance immunodeficiency unusual access inside body example trauma opportunistic infection caused microbes ordinarily contact host pathogenic bacteria fungi gastrointestinal upper respiratory tract also result otherwise innocuous microbes acquired hosts clostridium difficile colitis environment result traumatic introduction surgical wound infections compound fractures opportunistic disease requires impairment host defenses occur result genetic defects chronic granulomatous disease exposure antimicrobial drugs immunosuppressive chemicals might occur following poisoning cancer chemotherapy exposure ionizing radiation result infectious disease immunosuppressive activity measles malaria disease primary pathogens also cause severe disease host depressed resistance would normally occur immunosufficient host9
primary infection versus secondary infection
primary infection infection practically viewed root cause current health problem contrast secondary infection sequela complication root cause example pulmonary tuberculosis often primary infection infection happened burn penetrating trauma root cause allowed unusual access deep tissues secondary infection primary pathogens often cause primary infection also often cause secondary infection usually opportunistic infections viewed secondary infections immunodeficiency injury predisposing factor

infectious notedit
proving given disease infectious satisfy kochs postulates first proposed robert koch demands infectious agent identified patients healthy controls patients contract agent also develop disease postulates first used discovery mycobacteria species cause tuberculosis kochs postulates applied ethically many human diseases require experimental infection healthy individual pathogen produced pure culture often even clearly infectious diseases meet infectious criteria example treponema pallidum causative spirochete syphilis cannot cultured vitro however organism cultured rabbit testes less clear pure culture comes animal source serving host derived microbes derived plate culture epidemiology another important tool used study disease population infectious diseases helps determine disease outbreak sporadic occasional occurrence endemic regular cases often occurring region epidemic unusually high number cases region pandemic global epidemic
contagiousnessedit
infectious diseases sometimes called contagious disease easily transmitted contact person secretions influenza thus contagious disease subset infectious disease especially infective easily transmitted types infectioustransmissiblecommunicable diseases specialized routes infection vector transmission sexual transmission usually regarded contagious often require medical isolation sometimes loosely called quarantine victims however specialized connotation word contagious contagious disease easy transmissibility always respected popular infectious diseases commonly transmitted person person direct contact types contact person person droplet spread indirect contact airborne transmission contaminated objects food drinking water animal person contact animal reservoirs insect bites environmental reservoirs another infectious diseases transmitted10
anatomic locationedit
infections classified anatomic location organ system infected including

urinary tract infection
skin infection
respiratory tract infection
odontogenic infection infection originates within tooth closely surrounding tissues

pathophysiologyedit
general chain events applies infections14 chain events involves several stepsâ€”which include infectious agent reservoir entering susceptible host exit transmission hosts links must present chronological order infection develop understanding steps helps health care workers target infection prevent occurring first place15
colonizationedit




infection ingrown toenail yellow resultant inflammation redness swelling around nail


infection begins organism successfully enters body grows multiplies referred colonization humans easily infected weak sick malnourished cancer diabetic increased susceptibility chronic persistent infections individuals suppressed immune system particularly susceptible opportunistic infections entrance host hostpathogen interface generally occurs mucosa orifices like oral cavity nose eyes genitalia anus microbe enter open wounds organisms grow initial site entry many migrate cause systemic infection different organs pathogens grow within host cells intracellular whereas others grow freely bodily fluids
wound colonization refers nonreplicating microorganisms within wound infected wounds replicating organisms exist tissue injured multicellular organisms colonized degree extrinsic organisms vast majority exist either mutualistic commensal relationship host example former anaerobic bacteria species colonizes mammalian colon example latter various species staphylococcus exist human skin neither colonizations considered infections difference infection colonization often matter circumstance nonpathogenic organisms become pathogenic given specific conditions even virulent organism requires certain circumstances cause compromising infection colonizing bacteria corynebacteria viridans streptococci prevent adhesion colonization pathogenic bacteria thus symbiotic relationship host preventing infection speeding wound healing

variables involved outcome host becoming inoculated pathogen ultimate outcome include

route entry pathogen access host regions gains
intrinsic virulence particular organism
quantity load initial inoculant
immune status host colonized

example several staphylococcal species remain harmless skin present normally sterile space capsule joint peritoneum multiply without resistance cause harm
interesting fact chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry ribosomal analysis omics advanced technologies made apparent humans recent decades microbial colonization common even environments humans think nearly sterile normal bacterial colonization difficult know chronic wounds classified infected much risk progression exists despite huge number wounds seen clinical practice limited quality data evaluated symptoms signs review chronic wounds journal american medical associations rational clinical examination series quantified importance increased pain indicator infection19 review showed useful finding increase level pain likelihood ratio range 11â€“20 makes infection much likely absence pain negative likelihood ratio range 064â€“088 rule infection summary 064â€“088
diseaseedit
disease arise hosts protective immune mechanisms compromised organism inflicts damage host microorganisms cause tissue damage releasing variety toxins destructive enzymes example clostridium tetani releases toxin paralyzes muscles staphylococcus releases toxins produce shock sepsis infectious agents cause disease hosts example less individuals infected polio develop disease20 hand infectious agents highly virulent prion causing disease creutzfeldtâ€“jakob disease invariably kills animals people infected
persistent infections occur body unable clear organism initial infection persistent infections characterized continual presence infectious organism often latent infection occasional recurrent relapses active infection viruses maintain persistent infection infecting different cells body viruses acquired never leave body typical example herpes virus tends hide nerves become reactivated specific circumstances arise
persistent infections cause millions deaths globally year21 chronic infections parasites account high morbidity mortality many underdeveloped countries
transmissionedit
main article transmission medicine
infecting organisms survive repeat infection cycle hosts progeny must leave existing reservoir cause infection elsewhere infection transmission take place many potential routes

droplet contact also known respiratory route resultant infection termed airborne disease infected person coughs sneezes another person microorganisms suspended warm moist droplets enter body nose mouth surfaces
fecaloral transmission wherein foodstuffs water become contaminated people washing hands preparing food untreated sewage released drinking water supply people drink become infected common fecaloral transmitted pathogens include vibrio cholerae giardia species rotaviruses entameba histolytica escherichia coli tape worms22 pathogens cause gastroenteritis
sexual transmission resulting disease called sexually transmitted disease
oral transmission diseases transmitted primarily oral means caught direct oral contact kissing indirect contact sharing drinking glass cigarette
transmission direct contact diseases transmissible direct contact include athletes foot impetigo warts
vehicle transmission transmission inanimate reservoir food water soil23
vertical transmission directly mother embryo fetus baby pregnancy childbirth occur mother gets infection intercurrent disease pregnancy
iatrogenic transmission medical procedures injection transplantation infected material





culex mosquitos culex quinquefasciatus shown biological vectors transmit west nile virus



vectorborne transmission transmitted vector organism cause disease transmits infection conveying pathogens host another24

relationship virulence versus transmissibility complex disease rapidly fatal host microbe passed along another host
diagnosisedit
diagnosis infectious disease sometimes involves identifying infectious agent either directly indirectly practice minor infectious diseases warts cutaneous abscesses respiratory system infections diarrheal diseases diagnosed clinical presentation treated without knowledge specific causative agent conclusions cause disease based upon likelihood patient came contact particular agent presence microbe community epidemiological considerations given sufficient effort known infectious agents specifically identified benefits identification however often greatly outweighed cost often specific treatment cause obvious outcome infection benign
diagnosis infectious disease nearly always initiated medical history physical examination detailed identification techniques involve culture infectious agents isolated patient culture allows identification infectious organisms examining microscopic features detecting presence substances produced pathogens directly identifying organism genotype techniques xrays scans scans used produce images internal abnormalities resulting growth infectious agent images useful detection example bone abscess spongiform encephalopathy produced prion
symptomatic diagnosticsedit
diagnosis aided presenting symptoms individual infectious disease usually needs additional diagnostic techniques confirm suspicion signs specifically characteristic indicative disease called pathognomonic signs rare infections symptomatic25
children presence cyanosis rapid breathing poor peripheral perfusion petechial rash increases risk serious infection greater fold26 important indicators include parental concern clinical instinct temperature greater Â°c26
microbial cultureedit




four nutrient agar plates growing colonies common gram negative bacteria


microbiological culture principal tool used diagnose infectious disease microbial culture growth medium provided specific agent sample taken potentially diseased tissue fluid tested presence infectious agent able grow within medium pathogenic bacteria easily grown nutrient agar form solid medium supplies carbohydrates proteins necessary growth bacterium along copious amounts water single bacterium grow visible mound surface plate called colony separated colonies melded together lawn size color shape form colony characteristic bacterial species specific genetic makeup strain environment supports growth ingredients often added plate identification plates contain substances permit growth bacteria others change color response certain bacteria others bacteriological plates commonly used clinical identification infectious bacterium microbial culture also used identification viruses medium case cells grown culture virus infect alter kill case viral identification region dead cells results viral growth called plaque eukaryotic parasites also grown culture means identifying particular agent
absence suitable plate culture techniques microbes require culture within live animals bacteria mycobacterium leprae treponema pallidum grown animals although serological microscopic techniques make live animals unnecessary viruses also usually identified using alternatives growth culture animals viruses grown embryonated eggs another useful identification method xenodiagnosis vector support growth infectious agent chagas disease significant example difficult directly demonstrate presence causative agent trypanosoma cruzi patient therefore makes difficult definitively make diagnosis case xenodiagnosis involves vector chagas agent cruzi uninfected triatomine takes blood meal person suspected infected later inspected growth cruzi within
microscopyedit
another principal tool diagnosis infectious disease microscopy virtually culture techniques discussed rely point microscopic examination definitive identification infectious agent microscopy carried simple instruments compound light microscope instruments complex electron microscope samples obtained patients viewed directly light microscope often rapidly lead identification microscopy often also used conjunction biochemical staining techniques made exquisitely specific used combination antibody based techniques example antibodies made artificially fluorescent fluorescently labeled antibodies directed bind identify specific antigens present pathogen fluorescence microscope used detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound internalized antigens within clinical samples cultured cells technique especially useful diagnosis viral diseases light microscope incapable identifying virus directly
microscopic procedures also identifying infectious agents almost cells readily stain number basic dyes electrostatic attraction negatively charged cellular molecules positive charge cell normally transparent microscope using stain increases contrast cell background staining cell giemsa stain crystal violet allows microscopist describe size shape internal external components associations cells response bacteria different staining procedures used taxonomic classification microbes well methods gram stain acidfast stain standard approaches used classify bacteria diagnosis disease gram stain identifies bacterial groups firmicutes actinobacteria contain many significant human pathogens acidfast staining procedure identifies actinobacterial genera mycobacterium nocardia
biochemical testsedit
biochemical tests used identification infectious agents include detection metabolic enzymatic products characteristic particular infectious agent since bacteria ferment carbohydrates patterns characteristic genus species detection fermentation products commonly used bacterial identification acids alcohols gases usually detected tests bacteria grown selective liquid solid media
isolation enzymes infected tissue also provide basis biochemical diagnosis infectious disease example humans make neither replicases reverse transcriptase presence enzymes characteristic specific types viral infections ability viral protein hemagglutinin bind blood cells together detectable matrix also characterized biochemical test viral infection although strictly speaking hemagglutinin enzyme metabolic function
serological methods highly sensitive specific often extremely rapid tests used identify microorganisms tests based upon ability antibody bind specifically antigen antigen usually protein carbohydrate made infectious agent bound antibody binding sets chain events visibly obvious various ways dependent upon test example strep throat often diagnosed within minutes based appearance antigens made causative agent pyogenes retrieved patients throat cotton swab serological tests available usually preferred route identification however tests costly develop reagents used test often require refrigeration serological methods extremely costly although commonly used strep test inexpensive9
complex serological techniques developed known immunoassays immunoassays basic antibody antigen binding basis produce electromagnetic particle radiation signal detected form instrumentation signal unknowns compared standards allowing quantitation target antigen diagnosis infectious diseases immunoassays detect measure antigens either infectious agents proteins generated infected organism response foreign agent example immunoassay detect presence surface protein virus particle immunoassay hand detect measure antibodies produced organisms immune system made neutralize allow destruction virus
instrumentation used read extremely small signals created secondary reactions linked antibody antigen binding instrumentation control sampling reagent reaction times signal detection calculation results data management yield cost effective automated process diagnosis infectious disease
pcrbased diagnosticsedit
technologies based upon polymerase chain reaction method become nearly ubiquitous gold standards diagnostics near future several reasons first catalog infectious agents grown point virtually significant infectious agents human population identified second infectious agent must grow within human body cause disease essentially must amplify nucleic acids order cause disease amplification nucleic acid infected tissue offers opportunity detect infectious agent using third essential tools directing primers derived genomes infectious agents time genomes known already
thus technological ability detect infectious agent rapidly specifically currently available remaining blockades standard tool diagnosis cost application neither insurmountable diagnosis diseases benefit development methods clostridial diseases tetanus botulism diseases fundamentally biological poisonings relatively small numbers infectious bacteria produce extremely potent neurotoxins significant proliferation infectious agent occur limits ability detect presence bacteria
metagenomic sequencingedit
given wide range bacteria viruses pathogens cause debilitating lifethreatening illness ability quickly identify cause infection important often challenging example half cases encephalitis severe illness affecting brain remain undiagnosed despite extensive testing using stateoftheart clinical laboratory methods metagenomics currently researched clinical shows promise sensitive rapid diagnose infection using single allencompassing test test similar current tests however amplification genetic material unbiased rather using primers specific infectious agent amplification step followed nextgeneration sequencing alignment comparisons using large databases thousands organismic viral genomes
metagenomic sequencing could prove especially useful diagnosis patient immunocompromised everwider array infectious agents cause serious harm individuals immunosuppression clinical screening must often broader additionally expression symptoms often atypical making clinical diagnosis based presentation difficult thirdly diagnostic methods rely detection antibodies likely fail broad sensitive test pathogens detects presence infectious material rather antibodies therefore highly desirable
indication testsedit
usually indication specific identification infectious agent identification treatment prevention disease advance knowledge course illness prior development effective therapeutic preventative measures example early 1980s prior appearance treatment aids course disease closely followed monitoring composition patient blood samples even though outcome would offer patient treatment options part studies appearance specific communities permitted advancement hypotheses route transmission virus understanding disease transmitted resources could targeted communities greatest risk campaigns aimed reducing number infections specific serological diagnostic identification later genotypic molecular identification also enabled development hypotheses temporal geographical origins virus well myriad hypothesis9 development molecular diagnostic tools enabled physicians researchers monitor efficacy treatment antiretroviral drugs molecular diagnostics commonly used identify healthy people long onset illness used demonstrate existence people genetically resistant infection thus still cure aids great therapeutic predictive benefit identifying virus monitoring virus levels within blood infected individuals patient community large
preventionedit




washing ones hands form hygiene effective prevent spread infectious disease27


techniques like hand washing wearing gowns wearing face masks help prevent infections passed person another aseptic technique introduced medicine surgery late 19th century greatly reduced incidence infections caused surgery frequent hand washing remains important defense spread unwanted organisms28 forms prevention avoiding illicit drugs using condom healthy lifestyle balanced diet regular exercise cooking foods well avoiding foods left outside long time also important
antimicrobial substances used prevent transmission infections include

antiseptics applied living tissueskin
disinfectants destroy microorganisms found nonliving objects
antibiotics called prophylactic given prevention rather treatment infection however long term antibiotics leads resistance bacteria humans become immune antibiotics bacteria thus avoiding using antibiotics longer necessary helps preventing bacteria forming mutations aide antibiotic resistance

ways prevent slow transmission infectious diseases recognize different characteristics various diseases29 critical disease characteristics evaluated include virulence distance traveled victims level contagiousness human strains ebola virus example incapacitate victims extremely quickly kill soon result victims disease opportunity travel initial infection zone30 also virus must spread skin lesions permeable membranes thus initial stage ebola contagious since victims experience internal hemorrhaging result features spread ebola rapid usually stays within relatively confined geographical area contrast human immunodeficiency virus kills victims slowly attacking immune system9 result many victims transmit virus individuals even realizing carrying disease also relatively virulence allows victims travel long distances increasing likelihood epidemic
another effective decrease transmission rate infectious diseases recognize effects smallworld networks29 epidemics often extensive interactions within hubs groups infected individuals interactions within discrete hubs susceptible individuals despite interaction discrete hubs disease jump spread susceptible single interactions infected thus infection rates smallworld networks reduced somewhat interactions individuals within infected hubs eliminated figure however infection rates drastically reduced main focus prevention transmission jumps hubs needle exchange programs areas high density drug users example successful implementation treatment method another example ring culling vaccination potentially susceptible livestock adjacent farms prevent spread footandmouth virus 200131
general method prevent transmission vectorborne pathogens pest control
immunityedit




mary mallon typhoid mary asymptomatic carrier typhoid fever course career cook infected people three died


infection pathogens result death host offending organism ultimately cleared symptoms disease waned8 process requires immune mechanisms kill inactivate inoculum pathogen specific acquired immunity infectious diseases mediated antibodies andor lymphocytes immunity mediated factors manifested

direct effect upon pathogen antibodyinitiated complementdependent bacteriolysis opsonoization phagocytosis killing occurs bacteria
neutralization viruses organisms cannot enter cells
lymphocytes kill cell parasitized microorganism

immune system response microorganism often causes symptoms high fever inflammation potential devastating direct damage caused microbe9
resistance infection immunity acquired following disease asymptomatic carriage pathogen harboring organism similar structure crossreacting vaccination knowledge protective antigens specific acquired host immune factors complete primary pathogens opportunistic pathogens also phenomenon herd immunity offers measure protection otherwise vulnerable people large enough proportion population acquired immunity certain infections
immune resistance infectious disease requires critical level either antigenspecific antibodies andor cells host encounters pathogen individuals develop natural serum antibodies surface polysaccharides agents although little contact agent natural antibodies confer specific protection adults passively transmitted newborns
host genetic factorsedit
organism target infecting action specific infectious agent called host host harbors agent mature sexually active stage phase called definitive host intermediate host comes contact larvae stage host anything living attain asexual sexual reproduction32 clearance pathogens either treatmentinduced spontaneous influenced genetic variants carried individual patients instance genotype hepatitis treated pegylated interferonalpha2a pegylated interferonalpha2b brand names pegasys pegintron combined ribavirin shown genetic polymorphisms near human il28b gene encoding interferon lambda associated significant differences treatmentinduced clearance virus finding originally reported nature33 showed genotype hepatitis patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near il28b gene possibly achieve sustained virological response treatment others later report nature34 demonstrated genetic variants also associated natural clearance genotype hepatitis virus
treatmentsedit
infection attacks body antiinfective drugs suppress infection several broad types antiinfective drugs exist depending type organism targeted include antibacterial antibiotic including antitubercular antiviral antifungal antiparasitic including antiprotozoal antihelminthic agents depending severity type infection antibiotic given mouth injection applied topically severe infections brain usually treated intravenous antibiotics sometimes multiple antibiotics used case resistance antibiotic antibiotics work bacteria affect viruses antibiotics work slowing multiplication bacteria killing bacteria common classes antibiotics used medicine include penicillin cephalosporins aminoglycosides macrolides quinolones tetracyclinescitation needed
infections require treatment many selflimiting infections treatment cause sideeffects benefits antimicrobial stewardship concept healthcare providers treat infection antimicrobial specifically works well target pathogen shortest amount time treat known highly suspected pathogen respond medication35
