groundwater water present beneath earths surface soil pore spaces fractures rock formations unit rock unconsolidated deposit called aquifer yield usable quantity water depth soil pore spaces fractures voids rock become completely saturated water called water table groundwater recharged eventually flows surface naturally natural discharge often occurs springs seeps form oases wetlands groundwater also often withdrawn agricultural municipal industrial constructing operating extraction wells study distribution movement groundwater hydrogeology also called groundwater hydrology
typically groundwater thought water flowing shallow aquifers technical sense also contain soil moisture permafrost frozen soil immobile water permeability bedrock deep geothermal formation water groundwater hypothesized provide lubrication possibly influence movement faults likely much earths subsurface contains water mixed fluids instances groundwater confined earth formation landforms observed mars influenced groundwater also evidence liquid water also exist subsurface jupiters moon europa1
groundwater often cheaper convenient less vulnerable pollution surface water therefore commonly used public water supplies example groundwater provides largest source usable water storage united states california annually withdraws largest amount groundwater states2 underground reservoirs contain water capacity surface reservoirs lakes including great lakes many municipal water supplies derived solely groundwater3
polluted groundwater less visible difficult clean pollution rivers lakes groundwater pollution often results improper disposal wastes land major sources include industrial household chemicals garbage landfills excessive fertilizers pesticides used agriculture industrial waste lagoons tailings process wastewater mines industrial fracking field brine pits leaking underground storage tanks pipelines sewage sludge septic systems

main article aquifer
aquifer layer porous substrate contains transmits groundwater water flow directly surface saturated zone aquifer aquifer unconfined deeper parts unconfined aquifers usually saturated since gravity causes water flow downward
upper level saturated layer unconfined aquifer called water table phreatic surface water table general pore spaces saturated water phreatic zone
substrate porosity permits limited transmission groundwater known aquitard aquiclude substrate porosity virtually impermeable groundwater
confined aquifer aquifer overlain relatively impermeable layer rock substrate aquiclude aquitard confined aquifer follows downward grade recharge zone groundwater become pressurized flows create artesian wells flow freely without need pump rise higher elevation static water table unconfined aquifer
characteristics aquifers vary geology structure substrate topography occur general productive aquifers occur sedimentary geologic formations comparison weathered fractured crystalline rocks yield smaller quantities groundwater many environments unconsolidated poorly cemented alluvial materials accumulated valleyfilling sediments major river valleys geologically subsiding structural basins included among productive sources groundwater

relative groundwater travel times






dzherelo common source drinking water ukrainian village


groundwater makes twenty percent worlds fresh water supply entire worlds water including oceans permanent global groundwater storage roughly equal total amount freshwater stored snow pack including north south poles makes important resource natural storage buffer shortages surface water times drought4
groundwater naturally replenished surface water precipitation streams rivers recharge reaches water table5
groundwater longterm reservoir natural water cycle residence times days millennia opposed shortterm water reservoirs like atmosphere fresh surface water residence times minutes years figure6 shows deep groundwater quite distant surface recharge take long time complete natural cycle
great artesian basin central eastern australia largest confined aquifer systems world extending almost million analysing trace elements water sourced deep underground hydrogeologists able determine water extracted aquifers million years
comparing groundwater obtained different parts great artesian basin hydrogeologists found increases across basin water recharges aquifers along eastern divide ages young groundwater flows westward across continent increases oldest groundwater occurring western parts means order travelled almost 1000 source recharge million years groundwater flowing great artesian basin travels average rate metre year

certain problems beset groundwater around world river waters overused polluted many parts world aquifers difference aquifers sight major problem water management agencies calculating sustainable yield aquifer river water often counted water twice aquifer connected river problem although understood centuries persisted partly inertia within government agencies australia example prior statutory reforms initiated council australian governments water reform framework 1990s many australian states managed groundwater surface water separate government agencies approach beset rivalry poor communication
general time lags inherent dynamic response groundwater development ignored water management agencies decades scientific understanding issue consolidated brief effects groundwater overdraft although undeniably real take decades centuries manifest classic study 1982 bredehoeft colleagues9 modeled situation groundwater extraction intermontane basin withdrew entire annual recharge leaving ‘nothing’ natural groundwaterdependent vegetation community even borefield situated close vegetation original vegetation demand could still inherent system years year reduced signalling complete death groundwaterdependent vegetation science available make calculations decades however general water management agencies ignored effects appear outside rough timeframe political elections years marios sophocleous9 argued strongly management agencies must define appropriate timeframes groundwater planning mean calculating groundwater withdrawal permits based predicted effects decades sometimes centuries future
water moves landscape collects soluble salts mainly sodium chloride water enters atmosphere evapotranspiration salts left behind irrigation districts poor drainage soils surface aquifers result water tables coming surface lowlying areas major land degradation problems soil salinity waterlogging result10 combined increasing levels salt surface waters consequence major damage occurred local economies environments11
four important effects worthy brief mention first flood mitigation schemes intended protect infrastructure built floodplains unintended consequence reducing aquifer recharge associated natural flooding second prolonged depletion groundwater extensive aquifers result land subsidence associated infrastructure damage well third saline intrusion12 fourth draining acid sulphate soils often found lowlying coastal plains result acidification pollution formerly freshwater estuarine streams13
another cause concern groundwater drawdown overallocated aquifers potential cause severe damage terrestrial aquatic ecosystems cases conspicuously others quite imperceptibly extended period damage occurs14

groundwater also ecologically important importance groundwater ecosystems often overlooked even freshwater biologists ecologists groundwaters sustain rivers wetlands lakes well subterranean ecosystems within karst alluvial aquifers
ecosystems need groundwater course terrestrial ecosystems example open deserts similar arid environments exist irregular rainfall moisture delivers soil supplemented moisture terrestrial ecosystems hospitable environments groundwater plays central role groundwater fact fundamental many world’s major ecosystems water flows groundwaters surface waters rivers lakes wetlands places times feed groundwater varying degrees groundwater feeds soil moisture percolation many terrestrial vegetation communities depend directly either groundwater percolated soil moisture aquifer least part year hyporheic zones mixing zone streamwater groundwater riparian zones examples ecotones largely totally dependent groundwater
