biological scientists work applied research product development often knowledge gained basic research knowledge particular fields applications example applied research used develop pharmaceutical drugs treatments medical diagnostic tests increase crop yields develop biofuels usually less freedom basic researchers choose emphasis research spend time working marketable treatments meet business goals employers biological scientists conducting applied research product development private industry required describe research plans results nonscientists position veto approve ideas scientists must consider business effects work
biologists conduct laboratory experiments involving animals plants microorganisms however biological research also occurs outside laboratory involve natural observation rather experimentation example botanist investigate plant species present particular environment ecologist might study forest area recovers fire
swift advances knowledge genetics organic molecules spurred growth field biotechnology transforming industries biological scientists work biological scientists manipulate genetic material animals plants attempting make organisms productive resistant disease basic applied research biotechnological processes recombining production important substances including human insulin growth hormone many substances previously available large quantities produced biotechnological means substances useful treating diseases
working various genome chromosomes associated genes projects isolate genes determine function work continues lead discovery genes associated specific diseases inherited health risks sickle cell anemia advances biotechnology created research opportunities almost areas biology commercial applications areas medicine agriculture environmental remediation
specialistsedit
biological scientists specialize study certain type organism specific activity although recent advances blurred traditional classificationswhy

geneticists study genetics science genes heredity variation organisms
neuroscientists study physiology nervous system
developmental biologists study process development growth organisms
biochemists study chemical composition living things analyze complex chemical combinations reactions involved metabolism reproduction growth
molecular biologists study biological activity biomolecules
microbiologists investigate growth characteristics microscopic organisms bacteria algae fungi microbiologists specialize environmental food agricultural industrial microbiology virology study viruses immunology study mechanisms fight infections bioinformatics computers handle characterize biological information usually molecular level many microbiologists biotechnology advance knowledge cell reproduction human disease
physiologists study life functions plants animals whole organism cellular molecular level normal abnormal conditions physiologists often specialize functions growth reproduction photosynthesis respiration movement physiology certain area system organism
biophysicists study physics electrical mechanical energy related phenomena relates living cells organisms
computational biologists apply techniques computer science applied mathematics statistics address biological problems main focus lies developing mathematical modeling computational simulation techniques means addresses scientific research topics theoretical experimental questions without laboratory
zoologists wildlife biologists study animals wildlifeâ€”their origin behavior diseases life processes experiment live animals controlled natural surroundings others dissect dead animals study structure zoologists wildlife biologists also collect analyze biological data determine environmental effects current potential uses land water areas zoologists usually identified animal group study example ornithologists study birds mammalogists study mammals herpetologists study reptiles amphibians ichthyologists study fish cnidariologists study jellyfishes entomologists study insects
botanists study plants environments study aspects plant life including algae lichens mosses ferns conifers flowering plants others specialize areas identification classification plants structure function plant parts biochemistry plant processes causes cures plant diseases interaction plants organisms environment geological record plants evolution mycologists study fungi yeasts mold mushrooms separate kingdom plants
aquatic biologists study microorganisms plants animals living water marine biologists study salt water organisms limnologists study fresh water organisms much work marine biology centers molecular biology study biochemical processes take place inside living cells marine biology branch oceanography study biological chemical geological physical characteristics oceans ocean floor handbook statements environmental scientists hydrologists geoscientists
ecologists investigate relationships among organisms organisms environments examining effects population size pollutants rainfall temperature altitude using knowledge various scientific disciplines ecologists collect study report data quality food soil water
evolutionary biologists investigate evolutionary processes produced diversity life earth starting single common ancestor processes include natural selection common descent speciation

working conditionsedit
biological scientists usually exposed unsafe unhealthy conditions work dangerous organisms toxic substances laboratory must follow strict safety procedures avoid contamination many biological scientists botanists ecologists zoologists conduct field studies involve strenuous physical activity primitive living conditions biological scientists field work warm cold climates kinds weather
marine biologists encounter variety working conditions work laboratories others work research ships work underwater must practice safe diving working around sharp coral reefs hazardous marine life although marine biologists obtain specimens many still spend good deal time laboratories offices conducting tests running experiments recording results compiling data
many biological scientists depend grant money fund research pressure meet deadlines conform rigid grantwriting specifications preparing proposals seek extended funding
biological scientists typically work regular hours 40hour workweek common longer hours uncommon researchers required work hours laboratories locations especially field depending nature research
honors awardsedit
highest honor awarded biologists nobel prize physiology medicine awarded since 1901 royal swedish academy sciences another significant award crafoord prize biosciences established 1980
