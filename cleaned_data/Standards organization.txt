maudslays work well contributions engineers accomplished modest amount industry standardization companies inhouse standards spread within industries joseph whitworths screw thread measurements adopted first unofficial national standard companies around country 1841 came known british standard whitworth widely adopted countries23
early standards organizationsedit
19th century differences standards companies making trade increasingly difficult strained instance iron steel dealer recorded displeasure times architects engineers generally specify unnecessarily diverse types sectional material given work anything like economical continuous manufacture becomes impossible country professional agreed upon size weight girder employ given work
engineering standards committee established london 1901 worlds first national standards body45 subsequently extended standardization work became british engineering standards association 1918 adopting name british standards institution 1931 receiving royal charter 1929 national standards adopted universally throughout country enabled markets rationally efficiently increased level cooperation
first world similar national bodies established countries deutsches institut normung germany 1917 followed counterparts american national standard institute french commission permanente standardisation 19181

crompton drew first international standards body international electrotechnical commission 1906


late 19th century efforts made standardize electrical measurement important figure crompton became concerned large range different standards systems used electrical engineering companies scientists early 20th century many companies entered market 1890s chose settings voltage frequency current even symbols used circuit diagrams adjacent buildings would totally incompatible electrical systems simply fitted different companies crompton could lack efficiency system began consider proposals international standard electric engineering6
1904 crompton represented britain louisiana purchase exposition louis missouri part delegation institute electrical engineers presented paper standardisation well received asked look formation commission oversee process7 1906 work complete drew permanent constitution first international standards organization international electrotechnical commission8 body held first meeting year london representatives countries honour contribution electrical standardisation lord kelvin elected bodys first president9

many international standards organizations three largest wellestablished organizations international organization standardization international electrotechnical commission international telecommunication union existed years founded 1947 1906 1865 respectively based geneva switzerland established tens thousands standards covering almost every conceivable topic many adopted worldwide replacing various incompatible homegrown standards many standards naturally evolved designed inhouse within industry particular country others built scratch groups experts various technical committees three organizations together comprise world standards cooperation alliance

standards development processedit
organization develops standards used openly common formal rules published regarding process include

allowed vote provide input revised standards
formal stepbystep process
bias commercial interests handled
negative votes ballots handled
type consensus required

though tedious lengthy process formal standard setting essential developing technologies example since 1865 telecommunications industry depended establish telecommunications standards adopted worldwide created numerous telecommunications standards including telegraph specifications allocation telephone numbers interference protection protocols variety communications technologies standards created standards organizations lead improved product quality ensured interoperability competitors’ products provide technological baseline future research product development formal standard setting standards organizations numerous benefits consumers including increased innovation multiple market participants reduced production costs efficiency effects product interchangeability
standards distribution copyrightedit
standards specification education managed nonprofit organizations composed public entities private entities working cooperation publish standards open license charge requiring registration
technical library university copies technical standards hand major libraries large cities also access many technical standards
users standards mistakenly assume standards public domain assumption correct standards produced central governments whose publications amenable copyright organizations issue standard open license standards produced nongovernmental entities remain intellectual property developers unless specifically designed otherwise protected like publications copyright laws international treaties however intellectual property extends standard instance company sells device compliant given standard liable payment standards organization except special case organization holds patent rights ownership intellectual property described standard
however liable patent infringement implementation implementation technology standards organizations give guarantees patents relevant given standard identified standards draw attention foreword statement like following attention drawn possibility elements document subject patent rights shall held responsible identifying patent rights13 standards organization aware parts given standard fall patent protection often require patent holder agree reasonable nondiscriminatory licensing including standard agreement regarded legally binding contract14 2012 case microsoft motorola
trendsedit
everquickening pace technology evolution ever affecting standards proposed developed implemented
since traditional widely respected standards organizations tend operate slower pace technology evolves many standards develop becoming less relevant inability developers keep abreast technological innovation result class standards setters appeared standardization arena industry consortia standards setting organizations ssos despite limited financial resources enjoy truly international acceptance example world wide consortium whose standards html used universally also communitydriven associations internet engineering task force ietf worldwide network volunteers collaborate standards lowerlevel software solutions
industrydriven standards development efforts dont even formal organizational structure projects funded large corporations among openofficeorg apache software foundationsponsored international community volunteers working openstandard software aims compete microsoft office commercial groups competing fiercely develop industrywide standard highdensity optical storage
