significanceedit
vsevolod pudovkin noted editing process phase production truly unique motion pictures every aspect film making originated different medium film photography direction writing sound recording editing process unique filmcitation needed filmmaker stanley kubrick quoted saying love editing think like phase film making wanted frivolous might everything precedes editing merely producing film edit7
according writerdirector preston sturges

natural cutting replicates audience legitimate theater nearly film cutter approaches natural interest invisible cutting camera moves person another exact moment legitimate theatre would turned head conscious camera misses quarter second jolt requirement shots must approximately tone value cuts black white jarring given moment camera must point exact spot audience wishes look find spot absurdly easy remember looking time scene made8
