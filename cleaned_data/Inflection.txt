given word class subject inflection particular language generally standard patterns inflection paradigms described words class follow words follow standard pattern said regular inflect differently called irregular
instance many languages feature verb inflection regular verbs irregular verbs english regular verbs form past tense past participle ending thus verbs like play arrive enter regular however hundred verbs follow different patterns sing–sang–sung keep–kept–kept described irregular irregular verbs often preserve patterns regular past forms language become anomalous details english verbs english irregular verbs
types irregular inflected form include irregular plurals english mice children women english plural french yeux plural irregular comparative superlative forms adjectives adverbs english better best correspond positive form good well
irregularities four basic causes

euphony—where regular inflection would result forms sound esthetically unpleasing difficult pronounce english farther spanish tener tengo tendré comer como comeré
principal parts—these generally considered formed independently another student must memorize learning word example latin dīcō dīcere dīxī dictum spanish digo decir dije dicho
strong weak inflection—sometimes inflection systems exist conventionally classified strong weak instance english german weak verbs form past tense past participle adding ending english jump jumped german machen machte strong verbs change vowel cases form past participle adding english swim swam swum german schwimmen schwamm geschwommen ancient greek verbs likewise said first aorist ἔλῡσα second aorist ἔλιπον

inflectional morphologyedit
languages inflectional morphemes words sometimes called inflectional languages synonym inflected languages morphemes added several different ways

affixation simply adding morphemes onto word without changing root
reduplication doubling part word change meaning
alternation exchanging sound another root usually vowel sounds ablaut process found germanic strong verbs umlaut often found nouns among others
suprasegmental variations stress pitch tone sounds added changed intonation relative strength sound altered regularly example initialstressderived noun

affixing includes prefixing adding base suffixing adding base well much less common infixing inside circumfixing combination prefix suffix
inflection typically realized adding inflectional morpheme affixation base form either root stem
