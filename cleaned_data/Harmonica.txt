addition notes readily available diatonic harmonica players play notes adjusting embouchure forcing reed resonate different pitch technique called bending term possibly borrowed guitarists literally bend string subtly change pitch bending also creates glissandos characteristic much blues harp country harmonica playing bends essential blues rock harmonica soulful sounds instrument bring wail blues harp typically requires bending 1970s howard levy developed bending technique also known overblowing overdrawing bending combined bending allowed players play entire chromatic scale
addition playing diatonic harmonica original also possible play keys playing positions using different keynotes using basic notes instrument would mean playing specific mode position harmonica players especially blues players developed terminology around different positions confusing musicians example slang terminology common positions straight cross slant
another technique seldom used full potential altering size mouth cavity emphasize certain natural overtones technique employed playing chords care must taken overtone selection overtones stemming nonroot pitch cause extreme dissonance
