types crust
planetary geologists divide crust three categories based formed1
primary crust primordial crust
planets original crust forms solidification magma ocean toward planetary accretion terrestrial planets likely surfaces magma oceans cooled solidified crust2 crust likely destroyed large impacts reformed many times heavy bombardment drew close3
nature primary crust still debated chemical mineralogic physical properties unknown igneous mechanisms formed difficult study none earths primary crust survived today4 earths high rates erosion crustal recycling plate tectonics destroyed rocks older billion years including whatever primary crust earth
however geologists glean information primary crust studying terrestrial planets mercurys highlands might represent primary crust though debated5 anorthosite highlands moon primary crust formed plagioclase crystallized moons initial magma ocean floated top6 however unlikely earth followed similar pattern moon waterless system earth water7 martian meteorite alh84001 might represent primary crust mars however debated5 like earth venus lacks primary crust entire planet repeatedly resurfaced modified8
secondary crust
secondary crust formed partial melting silicate materials mantle usually basaltic composition9
common type crust solar system surfaces mercury venus earth mars comprise secondary crust lunar maria earth secondary crust forming primarily midocean spreading centers adiabatic rise mantle causes partial melting
tertiary crust
tertiary crust chemicallymodified either primary secondary form several ways

igneous processes partialmelting secondary crust coupled differentiation dehydration5
erosion sedimentation sediments derived primary secondary tertiary crust

known example tertiary crust continental crust earth unknown whether terrestrial planets said tertiary crust though evidence suggests likely plate tectonics needed create tertiary crust earth planet solar system plate tectonics

crust earth distinctive types

oceanic thick11 composed primarily denser mafic rocks basalt diabase gabbro
continental thick mostly composed less dense felsic rocks granite

continental oceanic crust less dense mantle types crust float mantle isostasy also reasons continental crust higher oceanic continental less dense floats higher result water pools oceanic crust forming oceans
temperature crust increases depth12 reaching values typically range boundary underlying mantle temperature increases much every kilometer locally upper part crust geothermal gradient smaller deeper crust13

formation evolution
main article formation earth
earth formed approximately billion years disk dust orbiting newlyformed formed accretion planetesimals smaller rocky bodies collided stuck gradually growing planet process generated enormous amount heat caused early earth melt completely planetary accretion slowed earth began cool forming first crust called primary primordial crust17 crust likely repeatedly destroyed large impacts reformed magma ocean left impact none earths primary crust survived today destroyed erosion impacts plate tectonics past several billion years
since earth forming secondary tertiary crust secondary crust forms midocean spreading centers partialmelting underlying mantle yields basaltic magmas ocean crust forms ridge push driving forces plate tectonics constantly creating ocean crust means crust must destroyed somewhere opposite spreading center usually subduction zone trench ocean plate shoved back mantle constant process creating ocean crust destroying ocean crust means oldest ocean crust earth today million years
contrast bulk continental crust much older oldest continental crustal rocks earth ages range billion years 1819 found narryer gneiss terrane western australia acasta gneiss northwest territories canadian shield cratonic regions fennoscandian shield zircon great billion years found narryer gneiss terrane
average current earths continental crust estimated billion years20 crustal rocks formed billion years located cratons continental crust underlying mantle asthenosphere less dense elsewhere earth readily destroyed subduction formation continental crust linked periods intense orogeny periods coincide formation supercontinents rodinia pangaea gondwana crust forms part aggregation island arcs including granite metamorphic fold belts preserved part depletion underlying mantle form buoyant lithospheric mantle
moons crust
