woven silk textile tomb mawangdui changsha hunan province china western dynasty century


several kinds wild silk produced caterpillars mulberry silkworm known used china south asia europe since ancient times however scale production always smaller cultivated silks several reasons first differ domesticated varieties colour texture therefore less uniform second cocoons gathered wild usually pupa emerge discovered silk thread makes cocoon torn shorter lengths third many wild cocoons covered mineral layer prevents attempts reel long strands silk5 thus obtain silk suitable spinning textiles areas commercial silks cultivated tedious laborintensive carding
commercial silks originate reared silkworm pupae bred produce whitecolored silk thread mineral surface pupae killed either dipping boiling water adult moths emerge piercing needle factors contribute ability whole cocoon unravelled continuous thread permitting much stronger cloth woven silk wild silks also tend difficult silk cultivated silkworm67 technique known demineralizing allows mineral layer around cocoon wild silk moths removed8 leaving variability color barrier creating commercial silk industry based wild silks parts world wild silk moths thrive africa south america
