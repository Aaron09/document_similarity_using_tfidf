groups beyond orbit jupiteredit
minor planets beyond orbit jupiter believed composed ices volatiles many similar comets differing perihelia orbits distant produce significant tail

damocloid asteroids also known oort cloud group named 5335 damocles defined objects fallen oort cloud aphelia generally still past uranus perihelia inner solar system high eccentricities sometimes high inclinations including retrograde orbits definition group somewhat fuzzy overlap significantly comets
centaurs mean orbital radius roughly currently believed transneptunian objects fell encounters giants first identified 2060 chiron hidalgo discovered identified distinct orbital class

groups beyond orbit neptuneedit

neptune trojans currently consist thirteen objects first discovered 2001 qr322
transneptunian objects tnos anything mean orbital radius greater classification includes kuiperbelt objects kbos scattered disc oort cloud

kuiperbelt objects extend roughly broken following subcategories

resonant objects occupy orbital resonances neptune excluding resonance neptune trojans

plutinos common resonant kbos resonance neptune like pluto perihelion object tends close neptunes orbit much happens pluto object comes perihelion neptune alternates degrees ahead degrees behind object theres chance collision defines object mean orbital radius plutino 90482 orcus 28978 ixion among brightest known
resonances several known objects resonance dubbed twotinos mean orbital radius eccentricity several objects mean orbital radius resonances among others largest resonance 84522 2002 tc302 largest resonance 225088 2007 or10


classical kuiperbelt objects also known cubewanos 15760 1992 mean orbital radius approximately cubewanos objects kuiper belt didnt scattered didnt locked resonance neptune largest makemake


scattered disc objects sdos typically unlike cubewanos resonant objects highinclination higheccentricity orbits perihelia still neptunes orbit assumed objects encountered neptune scattered originally circular orbits close ecliptic massive known dwarf planet eris belongs category
