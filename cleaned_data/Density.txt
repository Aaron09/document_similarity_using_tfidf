dimension







graduated cylinder containing various coloured liquids different densities


density precisely volumetric mass density substance mass unit volume symbol often used density lower case greek letter although latin letter also used mathematically density defined mass divided volume1
















displaystyle frac



density mass volume cases instance united states industry density loosely defined weight unit volume2 although scientifically inaccurate quantity specifically called specific weight
pure substance density numerical value mass concentration different materials usually different densities density relevant buoyancy purity packaging osmium iridium densest known elements standard conditions temperature pressure certain chemical compounds denser
simplify comparisons density across different systems units sometimes replaced dimensionless quantity relative density specific gravity ratio density material standard material usually water thus relative density less means substance floats water
density material varies temperature pressure variation typically small solids liquids much greater gases increasing pressure object decreases volume object thus increases density increasing temperature substance exceptions decreases density increasing volume materials heating bottom fluid results convection heat bottom decrease density heated fluid causes rise relative dense unheated material
reciprocal density substance occasionally called specific volume term sometimes used thermodynamics density intensive property increasing amount substance increase density rather increases mass

wellknown probably apocryphal tale archimedes given task determining whether king hieros goldsmith embezzling gold manufacture golden wreath dedicated gods replacing another cheaper alloy3 archimedes knew irregularly shaped wreath could crushed cube whose volume could calculated easily compared mass king approve baffled archimedes said taken immersion bath observed rise water upon entering could calculate volume gold wreath displacement water upon discovery leapt bath naked streets shouting eureka eureka εύρηκα greek found result term eureka entered common parlance used today indicate moment enlightenment

measurement density
homogeneous materials
density points homogeneous object equals total mass divided total volume mass normally measured scale balance volume measured directly geometry object displacement fluid determine density liquid hydrometer dasymeter coriolis flow meter used respectively similarly hydrostatic weighing uses displacement water submerged object determine density object
heterogeneous materials
body homogeneous density varies different regions object case density around given location determined calculating density small volume around location limit infinitesimal volume density inhomogeneous object point becomes

noncompact materials
practice bulk materials sugar sand snow contain voids many materials exist nature flakes pellets granules
voids regions contain something considered material commonly void could also vacuum liquid solid different gaseous mixture
bulk volume material—inclusive void fraction—is often obtained simple measurement calibrated measuring geometrically known dimensions
mass divided bulk volume determines bulk density thing volumetric mass density
determine volumetric mass density must first discount volume void fraction sometimes determined geometrical reasoning closepacking equal spheres nonvoid fraction also determined empirically bulk materials however sand variable void fraction depends material agitated poured might loose compact less space depending handling
practice void fraction necessarily even gaseous case sand could water advantageous measurement void fraction sand saturated water—once bubbles thoroughly driven out—is potentially consistent sand measured void
case noncompact materials must also take care determining mass material sample material pressure commonly ambient pressure earths surface determination mass measured sample weight might need account buoyancy effects density void constituent depending measurement conducted case sand sand much denser buoyancy effect commonly neglected less part thousand
mass change upon displacing void material another maintaining constant volume used estimate void fraction difference density voids materials reliably known
changes density
main articles compressibility thermal expansivity
general density changed changing either pressure temperature increasing pressure always increases density material increasing temperature generally decreases density notable exceptions generalization example density water increases melting point similar behavior observed silicon temperatures
effect pressure temperature densities liquids solids small compressibility typical liquid solid 10−6 bar−1 typical thermal expansivity 10−5 roughly translates needing around thousand times atmospheric pressure reduce volume substance percent although pressures needed around thousand times smaller sandy soil clays percent expansion volume typically requires temperature increase order thousands degrees celsius
contrast density gases strongly affected pressure density ideal
