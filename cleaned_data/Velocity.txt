constant velocity acceleration
constant velocity object must constant speed constant direction constant direction constrains object motion straight path thus constant velocity means motion straight line constant speed

example moving constant kilometres hour circular path constant speed constant velocity direction changes hence considered undergoing acceleration
distinction speed velocity




kinematic quantities classical particle mass position velocity acceleration


speed describes fast object moving whereas velocity gives fast direction object moving1 said travel speed specified however said move north velocity specified
difference noticed consider movement around circle something moves circular path constant speed returns starting point average velocity zero average speed found dividing circumference circle time taken move around circle average velocity calculated considering displacement starting points average speed considers total distance traveled
