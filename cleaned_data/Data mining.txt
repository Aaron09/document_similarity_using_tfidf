etymologyedit
1960s statisticians used terms like data fishing data dredging refer considered practice analyzing data without apriori hypothesis term data mining appeared around 1990 database community short time 1980s phrase database mining™ used since trademarked diegobased company pitch database mining workstation10 researchers consequently turned data mining terms used include data archaeology information harvesting information discovery knowledge extraction gregory piatetskyshapiro coined term knowledge discovery databases first workshop topic kdd1989 term became popular machine learning community however term data mining became popular business press communities11 currently terms data mining knowledge discovery used interchangeably
academic community major forums research started 1995 first international conference data mining knowledge discovery kdd95 started montreal aaai sponsorship cochaired usama fayyad ramasamy uthurusamy year later 1996 usama fayyad launched journal kluwer called data mining knowledge discovery founding editorinchief later started sigkddd newsletter sigkdd explorations12 international conference became primary highest quality conference data mining acceptance rate research paper submissions journal data mining knowledge discovery primary research journal field
backgroundedit
manual extraction patterns data occurred centuries early methods identifying patterns data include bayes theorem 1700s regression analysis 1800s proliferation ubiquity increasing power computer technology dramatically increased data collection storage manipulation ability data sets grown size complexity direct handson data analysis increasingly augmented indirect automated data processing aided discoveries computer science neural networks cluster analysis genetic algorithms 1950s decision trees decision rules 1960s support vector machines 1990s data mining process applying methods intention uncovering hidden patterns13 large data sets bridges applied statistics artificial intelligence usually provide mathematical background database management exploiting data stored indexed databases execute actual learning discovery algorithms efficiently allowing methods applied ever larger data sets

preprocessingedit
data mining algorithms used target data must assembled data mining uncover patterns actually present data target data must large enough contain patterns remaining concise enough mined within acceptable time limit common source data data mart data warehouse preprocessing essential analyze multivariate data sets data mining target cleaned data cleaning removes observations containing noise missing data
data miningedit
data mining involves common classes tasks5

anomaly detection outlierchangedeviation detection identification unusual data records might interesting data errors require investigation
association rule learning dependency modelling searches relationships variables example supermarket might gather data customer purchasing habits using association rule learning supermarket determine products frequently bought together information marketing purposes sometimes referred market basket analysis
clustering task discovering groups structures data another similar without using known structures data
classification task generalizing known structure apply data example email program might attempt classify email legitimate spam
regression attempts find function models data least error estimating relationships among data datasets
summarization providing compact representation data including visualization report generation

results validationedit




example data produced data dredging operated statistician tyler vigen apparently showing close link best word winning spelling competition number people united states killed venomous spiders similarity trends obviously coincidence


data mining unintentionally misused produce results appear significant actually predict future behaviour cannot reproduced sample data bear little often results investigating many hypotheses performing proper statistical hypothesis testing simple version problem machine learning known overfitting problem arise different phases process thus traintest split applicable sufficient prevent happening18
