cast iron group ironcarbon alloys carbon content greater usefulness derives relatively melting temperature alloy constituents affect colour fractured white cast iron carbide impurities allow cracks pass straight grey cast iron graphite flakes deflect passing crack initiate countless cracks material breaks ductile cast iron spherical graphite nodules stop crack progressing
carbon ranging 18–4 silicon main alloying elements cast iron iron alloys lower carbon content known steel technically makes fe–c–si system ternary principle cast iron solidification understood simpler binary iron–carbon phase diagram since compositions cast irons around eutectic point lowest liquid point iron–carbon system melting temperatures usually range 1150 1200 2100 2190 lower melting point pure iron
cast iron tends brittle except malleable cast irons relatively melting point good fluidity castability excellent machinability resistance deformation wear resistance cast irons become engineering material wide range applications used pipes machines automotive industry parts cylinder heads declining usage cylinder blocks gearbox cases declining usage resistant destruction weakening oxidation

also iron bridge
cast iron structural purposes began late 1770s abraham darby built iron bridge although short beams already used blast furnaces coalbrookdale inventions followed including patented thomas paine castiron bridges became commonplace industrial revolution gathered pace thomas telford adopted material bridge upstream buildwas longdonontern aqueduct canal trough aqueduct longdonontern shrewsbury canal
followed chirk aqueduct pontcysyllte aqueduct remain following recent restorations castiron beam bridges used widely early railways water street bridge manchester terminus liverpool manchester railway problems arose bridge carrying chester holyhead railway across river chester collapsed 1847 less year opened bridge disaster caused excessive loading centre beam passing train many similar bridges demolished rebuilt often wrought iron bridge badly designed trussed wrought iron straps wrongly thought reinforce structure centres beams bending lower edge tension cast iron like masonry weak
best using cast iron bridge construction using arches material compression cast iron like masonry strong compression wrought iron like kinds iron indeed like metals general strong tension also tough resistant fracturing relationship wrought iron cast iron structural purposes thought analogous relationship wood stone
nevertheless cast iron continued used inappropriate structural ways rail bridge disaster 1879 cast serious doubt material crucial lugs holding bars struts bridge cast integral columns failed early stages accident addition bolt holes also cast drilled tension bars placed corner rather spread length hole replacement bridge built wrought iron steel
