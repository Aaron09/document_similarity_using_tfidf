first color photograph made threecolor method suggested james clerk maxwell 1855 taken 1861 thomas sutton subject colored tartan patterned ribbon


color photography explored beginning 1840s early experiments color required extremely long exposures hours days camera images could photograph prevent color quickly fading exposed white light
first permanent color photograph taken 1861 using threecolorseparation principle first published scottish physicist james clerk maxwell 18553031 foundation virtually practical color processes maxwells idea take three separate blackandwhite photographs green blue filters3031 provides photographer three basic channels required recreate color image transparent prints images could projected similar color filters superimposed projection screen additive method color reproduction color print paper could produced superimposing carbon prints three images made complementary colors subtractive method color reproduction pioneered louis ducos hauron late 1860s




color photography possible long kodachrome 1903 portrait sarah angelina acland demonstrates earliest years need special equipment long exposures complicated printing processes made extremely rare


russian photographer sergei mikhailovich prokudingorskii made extensive color separation technique employing special camera successively exposed three colorfiltered images different parts oblong plate exposures simultaneous unsteady subjects exhibited color fringes rapidly moving scene appeared brightly colored ghosts resulting projected printed images
implementation color photography hindered limited sensitivity early photographic materials mostly sensitive blue slightly sensitive green virtually insensitive discovery sensitization photochemist hermann vogel 1873 suddenly made possible sensitivity green yellow even improved color sensitizers ongoing improvements overall sensitivity emulsions steadily reduced onceprohibitive long exposure times required color bringing ever closer commercial viability
autochrome first commercially successful color process introduced lumière brothers 1907 autochrome plates incorporated mosaic color filter layer made dyed grains potato starch allowed three color components recorded adjacent microscopic image fragments autochrome plate reversal processed produce positive transparency starch grains served illuminate fragment correct color tiny colored points blended together synthesizing color subject additive method autochrome plates several varieties additive color screen plates films marketed 1890s 1950s
