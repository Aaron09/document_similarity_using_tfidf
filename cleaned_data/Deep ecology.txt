principlesedit
proponents deep ecology believe world exist resource freely exploited humans material goods guarantee happiness beyond moderate level overconsumption endangering biosphere defining nonconsumptive paradigm wellbeing seems primordial paradigm would nonacquisitivenonconsumerist nonhierarchical relation place earth6 ethics deep ecology hold survival part dependent upon wellbeing whole proponents deep ecology offer eighttier platform elucidate claims7


wellbeing flourishing human nonhuman life earth value values independent usefulness nonhuman world human purposes
richness diversity life forms contribute realization values also values
humans right reduce richness diversity except satisfy vital human needs
flourishing human life cultures compatible substantial decrease human population flourishing nonhuman life requires decrease
present human interference nonhuman world excessive situation rapidly worsening
policies must therefore changed policies affect basic economic technological ideological structures resulting state affairs deeply different present
ideological change mainly appreciating life quality dwelling situations inherent value rather adhering increasingly higher standard living profound awareness difference great
subscribe foregoing points obligation directly indirectly implement necessary changes


principles reduced three simple propositions

wilderness biodiversity preservation
human population control
simple living treading lightly planet3
