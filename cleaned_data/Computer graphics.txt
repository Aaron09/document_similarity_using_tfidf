overviewedit
term computer graphics used broad sense describe almost everything computers text sound1 typically term computer graphics refers several different things

representation manipulation image data computer
various technologies used create manipulate images
subfield computer science studies methods digitally synthesizing manipulating visual content study computer graphics

today computer graphics widespread imagery found television newspapers weather reports variety medical investigations surgical procedures wellconstructed graph present complex statistics form easier understand interpret media graphs used illustrate papers reports theses presentation material2
many tools developed visualize data computer generated imagery categorized several different types dimensional three dimensional animated graphics technology improved computer graphics become common computer graphics still widely used computer graphics emerged subfield computer science studies methods digitally synthesizing manipulating visual content past decade specialized fields developed like information visualization scientific visualization concerned visualization three dimensional phenomena architectural meteorological medical biological emphasis realistic renderings volumes surfaces illumination sources forth perhaps dynamic time component3
