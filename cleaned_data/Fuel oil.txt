residual fuel less useful viscous heated special heating system contain relatively high amounts pollutants particularly sulfur forms sulfur dioxide upon combustion however undesirable properties make cheap fact cheapest liquid fuel available since requires heating residual fuel cannot used road vehicles boats small ships heating equipment takes valuable space makes vehicle heavier heating also delicate procedure inappropriate small fast moving vehicles however power plants large ships able residual fuel
residual fuel common past powered boilers railroad steam locomotives steamships locomotives however become powered diesel electric power steamships common previously higher operating costs carriers steam plants boiloff emitted cargo used fuel source boilers heating natural industrial boilers still buildings including york city 2011 city estimated buildings burned fuel oils responsible soot pollution generated buildings city york made phase fuel grades part environmental plan planyc concerns health effects caused fine particulates9 buildings using fuel converted less polluting fuel 201510
residual fuels electrical generation also decreased 1973 residual fuel produced electricity 1983 fallen 2005update electricity production forms petroleum including diesel residual fuel total production decline result price competition natural environmental restrictions emissions power plants costs heating extra pollution control additional maintenance required burning often outweigh cost fuel burning fuel particularly residual fuel produces uniformly higher carbon dioxide emissions natural gas11
heavy fuel oils continue used boiler lighting facility many coalfired power plants approximately analogous using kindling start fire without performing difficult begin largescale combustion process
chief drawback residual fuel high initial viscosity particularly case requires correctly engineered system storage pumping burning though still usually lighter water specific gravity usually ranging much heavier viscous kerosene gasoline must fact stored around heated 65–120 149–248 easily pumped cooler temperatures congeal tarry semisolid flash point blends incidentally attempting pump highviscosity temperatures frequent cause damage fuel lines furnaces related equipment often designed lighter fuels
comparison 2869 class heavy fuel behaves similar fashion requiring storage pumping around finalising burning around 90–120 194–248
facilities historically burned residual oils industrial plants similar facilities constructed early 20th century switched coal fuel time period either case residual seen good prospect cheap readily available facilities subsequently closed demolished replaced fuel supplies simpler high sulfur content oil—up weight extreme cases—had corrosive effect many heating systems usually designed without adequate corrosion protection mind shortening lifespans increasing polluting effects particularly case furnaces regularly shut allowed cold since internal condensation produced sulfuric acid
environmental cleanups facilities frequently complicated asbestos insulation fuel feed lines persistent degrade rapidly viscosity stickiness also make remediation underground contamination difficult since properties reduce effectiveness methods stripping
released water river ocean residual tends break patches tarballs—mixtures particulate matter silt floating organic matter rather form single slick average material evaporate within hours release primarily lighter hydrocarbon fractions remainder often sink bottom water column
