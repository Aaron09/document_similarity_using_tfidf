benefits telecommunications networkingedit
telecommunications greatly increase expand resources types people example businesses need greater telecommunications network plan expand company internet computer telephone networks businesses allocate resources efficiently core types networks discussed
computer network computer network consists computers devices connected another information transferred device next example office filled computers share files together separate device computer networks range local network area wide area network difference types networks size types computer networks work certain speeds also known broadband internet network connects computers worldwide
internet network access network allows users many resources time internet network replace books enable users discover information almost instantly apply concepts different situations internet used recreational governmental educational purposes businesses particular internet network research service customers clients
telephone network telephone network connects people another network used variety ways many businesses telephone network route calls andor service customers businesses telephone network greater scale private branch exchange system specific business focuses routing servicing calls another business majority time telephone network used around world recreational purposes
network structureedit
general every telecommunications network conceptually consists three parts planes called thought often separate overlay networks

data plane also user plane bearer plane forwarding plane carries networks users traffic actual payload
control plane carries control information also known signaling
management plane carries operations administration traffic required network management management plane sometimes considered part control plane

example tcpip data networkedit
data network used extensively throughout world connect individuals organizations data networks connected allow users seamless access resources hosted outside particular provider connected internet3 best example many data networ1ks different organizations operating single address space
terminals attached tcpip networks addressed using addresses different types address common version unique address consists integers usually separated dots written 821313456
tcpip fundamental protocols provide control routing messages across data network many different network structures tcpip used across efficiently route messages example

wide area networks
metropolitan area networks
local area networks
internet area networks
campus area networks
virtual private networks

three features differentiate mans lans wans

area network size lans wans physical area diameter3
mans generally belong single organization equipment interconnects network links often owned association network provider provides leases service others3
means sharing resources high speeds within network often provide connections networks access resources outside scope man3
