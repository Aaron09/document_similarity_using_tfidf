wide array legal requirements expensive process ipos also typically involve firms major practices securities magic circle firms london white shoe firms york city
financial historians richard sylla robert wright shown 1860 early corporations sold shares directly public without intermediaries like investment banks23 direct public offering term it24 done auction rather share price issuing corporation sense fixed price public offers traditional method nonus countries early 1990s eliminated agency problem associated offerings intermediated investment banks

public offerings sold institutional investors retail clients underwriters licensed securities salesperson registered representative canada selling shares public offering clients paid portion selling concession paid issuer underwriter rather client situations issue undersubscribed salesperson clients advisor possible financial incentives advisor client aligned
issuer usually allows underwriters option increase size offering certain circumstance known greenshoe overallotment option option always exercised offering considered issue virtue oversubscribed
clients given preliminary prospectus known herring prospectus initial quiet period herring prospectus named bold warning statement printed front cover warning states offering information incomplete changed actual wording vary although roughly follow format exhibited facebook herring25 quiet period shares cannot offered sale brokers however take indications interest clients time stock launch registration statement become effective indications interest converted orders discretion buyer sales made final prospectus cleared securities exchange commission

historically many ipos underpriced effect underpricing generate additional interest stock first becomes publicly traded flipping quickly selling shares profit lead significant gains investors allocated shares offering price however underpricing results lost potential capital issuer extreme example theglobecom helped fuel mania late 1990s internet underwritten bear stearns november 1998 priced share share price quickly increased 1000 opening trading high selling pressure institutional flipping eventually drove stock back closed although company raise million offering estimated level demand offering volume trading took place might left upwards million table
danger overpricing also important consideration stock offered public higher price market underwriters trouble meeting commitments sell shares even sell issued shares stock fall value first trading stock lose marketability hence even value could result losses investors many favored clients underwriters perhaps best known example facebook 2012
underwriters therefore take many factors consideration pricing attempt reach offering price enough stimulate interest stock high enough raise adequate amount capital company pricing underwriters variety performance indicators nongaap measures28 process determining optimal price usually involves underwriters syndicate arranging share purchase commitments leading institutional investors
researchers friesen swift 2009 believe underpricing ipos less deliberate part issuers andor underwriters result overreaction part investors friesen swift 2009 potential method determining underpricing underpricing algorithms
