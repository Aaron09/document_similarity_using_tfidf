historyedit
increasing demand computers universities research labs late 1960s generated need provide highspeed interconnections computer systems 1970 report lawrence radiation laboratory detailing growth octopus network gave good indication situation23
number experimental early commercial technologies developed 1970s cambridge ring developed cambridge university starting 19744 ethernet developed xerox parc 1973–19755 filed patent 4063220 1976 system deployed parc robert metcalfe david boggs published seminal paper ethernet distributed packetswitching local computer networks6 arcnet developed datapoint corporation 1976 announced 19777 first commercial installation december 1977 chase manhattan bank york8
development proliferation personal computers using operating system late 1970s later dosbased systems starting 1981 meant many sites grew dozens even hundreds computers initial driving force networking generally share storage printers expensive time much enthusiasm concept several years 1983 onward computer industry pundits would regularly declare coming year “the year lan”91011
practice concept marred proliferation incompatible physical layer network protocol implementations plethora methods sharing resources typically vendor would type network card cabling protocol network operating system solution appeared advent novell netware provided evenhanded support dozens competing cardcable types much sophisticated operating system competitors netware dominated12 personal computer business early introduction 1983 mid1990s microsoft introduced windows advanced server windows workgroups
competitors netware banyan vines comparable technical strengths banyan never gained secure base microsoft 3com worked together create simple network operating system formed base 3coms 3share microsofts manager ibms server none particularly successful
period unix workstations using tcpip networking although market segment much reduced technologies developed area continue influential internet linux apple networking—and tcpip protocol replaced appletalk protocols used early lans
cablingedit
early cabling generally based various grades coaxial cable shielded twisted pair used ibms token ring implementation 1984 starlan showed potential simple unshielded twisted pair using cat3 cable—the simple cable used telephone systems development 10baset successors structured cabling still basis commercial lans today
fiberoptic cabling common links switches fiber desktop rare13
wireless mediaedit
many lans wireless technologies built smartphones tablet computers laptops wireless local area network users move unrestricted coverage area wireless networks become popular residences small businesses ease installation guests often offered internet access hotspot service
technical aspectsedit
network topology describes layout interconnections devices network segments data link layer physical layer wide variety topologies used including ring mesh star higher layers netbeui ipxspx appletalk others common internet protocol suite tcpip prevailed standard choice
simple lans generally consist cabling switches switch connected router cable modem adsl modem internet access include wide variety network devices firewalls load balancers network intrusion detection14 advanced lans characterized redundant links switches using spanning tree protocol prevent loops ability manage differing traffic types quality service segregate traffic vlans
lans maintain connections lans leased lines leased services across internet using virtual private network technologies depending connections established secured distance involved linked lans also classified metropolitan area network wide area network
