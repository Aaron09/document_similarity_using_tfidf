earliest english language uses conscious consciousness date back however 1500s english word conscious originally derived latin conscius together scio know latin word meaning word—it meant knowing words joint common knowledge another14 however many occurrences latin writings phrase conscius sibi translates literally knowing oneself words sharing knowledge oneself something phrase figurative meaning knowing knows modern english word conscious earliest uses 1500s english word conscious retained meaning latin conscius example thomas hobbes leviathan wrote know fact said conscious another15 latin phrase conscius sibi whose meaning closely related current concept consciousness rendered english conscious oneself conscious unto oneself example archbishop ussher wrote 1613 conscious unto great weakness16 lockes definition 1690 illustrates gradual shift meaning taken place

philosophy mind given rise many stances regarding consciousness routledge encyclopedia philosophy 1998 defines consciousness follows

consciousness—philosophers used term consciousness four main topics knowledge general intentionality introspection knowledge specifically generates phenomenal experience something within ones mind introspectively conscious case introspects poised introspection often thought deliver ones primary knowledge ones mental life experience mental entity phenomenally conscious case something like clearest examples perceptual experience tastings seeings bodilysensational experiences pains tickles itches imaginative experiences ones actions perceptions streams thought experience thinking words images introspection phenomenality seem independent dissociable although controversial22

skeptical definition consciousness stuart sutherland exemplified difficulties fully ascertaining cognate meanings entry 1989 version macmillan dictionary psychology

philosophers nonphilosophers differ intuitions consciousness is24 people strong intuition existence refer consciousness25 skeptics argue intuition false either concept consciousness intrinsically incoherent intuitions based illusions gilbert ryle example argued traditional understanding consciousness depends cartesian dualist outlook improperly distinguishes mind body mind world proposed speak minds bodies world individuals persons acting world thus speaking consciousness misleading thinking sort thing consciousness separated behavioral linguistic understandings26 generally many philosophers scientists unhappy difficulty producing definition involve circularity fuzziness23
types consciousnessedit
many philosophers argued consciousness unitary concept understood intuitively majority people spite difficulty defining it25 others though argued level disagreement meaning word indicates either means different things different people instance objective versus subjective aspects consciousness else umbrella term encompassing variety distinct meanings simple element common27
block proposed distinction types consciousness called phenomenal pconsciousness access aconsciousness28 pconsciousness according block simply experience moving colored forms sounds sensations emotions feelings bodies responses center experiences considered independently impact behavior called qualia aconsciousness hand phenomenon whereby information minds accessible verbal report reasoning control behavior perceive information perceive access conscious introspect information thoughts access conscious remember information past access conscious although philosophers daniel dennett disputed validity distinction29 others broadly accepted david chalmers argued aconsciousness principle understood mechanistic terms understanding pconsciousness much challenging calls hard problem consciousness30
philosophers believe blocks types consciousness story william lycan example argued book consciousness experience least eight clearly distinct types consciousness identified organism consciousness control consciousness consciousness stateevent consciousness reportability introspective consciousness subjective consciousness selfconsciousness—and even list omits several obscure forms31
also debate whether aconsciousness pconsciousness always coexist exist separately although pconsciousness without aconsciousness widely accepted hypothetical examples without block instance suggests case “zombie” computationally identical person without subjectivity however remains somewhat skeptical concluding don’t know whether actual cases aconsciousness without pconsciousness hope illustrated conceptual possibility
