hecataeus record events occurred living memory unlike herodotus include oral traditions greek history within larger framework oriental history9 proof herodotus derived ambitious scope work grand theme civilizations conflict predecessor despite much scholarly speculation modern times510 herodotus claims better informed predecessors relying empirical observation correct excessive schematism example argues continental asymmetry opposed older theory perfectly circular earth europe asiaafrica equal size histories however retains idealizing tendencies symmetrical notions danube nile11

contemporary modern criticsedit

early travelsedit
herodotus reveals halicarnassus though dorian city ended close relations dorian neighbours unseemly quarrel helped pioneer greek trade egypt therefore outwardlooking internationalminded port within persian empire historians family could well contacts countries persian rule facilitating travels researches
herodotuss eyewitness accounts indicate traveled egypt association athenians probably time possibly earlier athenian fleet assisted uprising persian rule 460–454 probably traveled tyre next euphrates babylon reason possibly associated local politics subsequently found unpopular halicarnassus time around migrated periclean athens city whose people democratic institutions openly admires athens also place came know local topography viii 52–5 well leading citizens alcmaeonids clan whose history features frequently writing

author oratoredit
herodotus would made researches known larger world oral recitations public crowd john marincola writes introduction penguin edition histories certain identifiable pieces early books herodotuss work could labeled performance pieces portions research seem independent almost detachable might aside author purposes oral performance intellectual matrix century marincola suggests comprised many oral performances philosophers would dramatically recite detachable pieces work idea criticize previous arguments topic emphatically enthusiastically insert order audience35
conventional herodotuss authors publish works reciting popular festivals according lucian herodotus took finished work straight anatolia olympic games read entire histories assembled spectators sitting receiving rapturous applause it36 according different account ancient grammarian37 herodotus refused begin reading work festival olympia clouds offered shade time assembly dispersed hence proverbial expression herodotus shade describe someone misses opportunity delay herodotuss recitation olympia favourite theme among ancient writers another interesting variation story found suda photius38 tzetzes39 young thucydides happened assembly father burst tears recital herodotus observed prophetically boys father sons soul yearns knowledge
eventually thucydides herodotus became close enough interred thucydides tomb athens least opinion marcellinus life thucydides40 according suda buried macedonian pella agora thurium41

herodotuss sources sense authorityedit
clear beginning book histories herodotus utilizes least claims utilize various sources narrative waters relates herodotos work purely hellenic standpoint indeed accused patriotic somewhat imperceptive plutarch philobarbaros probarbarian proforeigner78
herodotus times relate various accounts story example book mentions phoenician persian accounts io79 however herodotus time arbitrate varying accounts going events happened rather point know fact began wrongdoing greeks80 later herodotus claims authority know happened heard delphians myself81
throughout work herodotus attempts explain actions people speaking solon athenian herodotus states solon sailed away pretext seeing world really could compelled repeal laws laid down82 story croesus sons death speaking adrastus accidentally killed croesus herodotus states adrastus believing illfated ever known throat grave83
herodotus people discussing claims understand thoughts intentions
mode explanationedit
herodotus writes purpose explaining discusses reason cause event lays proem publication research herodotus halicarnassus actions people shall fade time great admirable achievements greeks barbarians shall unrenowned among things forth reasons waged other84
mode explanation traces back homer85 opened iliad asking

apollo
zeus’ leto’s offended

chryses apollos priest

homer herodotus begin question causality homers case others throats herodotuss case greeks barbarians
herodotuss means explanation necessarily posit simple cause rather explanations cover host potential causes emotions notable however obligations gratitude revenge fundamental human motives herodotus primary stimulus generation narrative itself87
readers herodotus believe habit tying events back personal motives signifies inability broader abstract reasons action gould argues contrary likely herodotus attempts provide rational reasons understood contemporaries rather providing abstract reasons88
types causalityedit
herodotus attributes cause divine human agents perceived mutually exclusive rather mutually interconnected true greek thinking general least homer onward89 gould notes invoking supernatural order explain event answer question happen rather happen example faulty craftsmanship human cause house collapsing however divine reason house collapses particular moment inside gods house collapsed particular individual within whereas cause house weak structure prone falling90
authors including geoffrey croix mabel lang argued fate belief herodotuss ultimate understanding causality91 herodotuss explanation event going happen maps well aristotelean homeric means expression idea going happen reveals tragic discovery associated fifthcentury drama tragic discovery seen homers iliad well92
john gould argues herodotus understood falling long line storytellers rather thinking means explanation philosophy history simple causality thus according gould herodotuss means explanation mode storytelling narration passed generations prior93

herodotus sense going happen language holds theory historical necessity sees whole human experience constrained inevitability without room human choice human responsibility diminished belittled forces large comprehension resistance rather traditional language teller tales whose tale structured awareness shape must presents human experience model narrative patterns built stories narrative impulse impulse towards closure sense ending retrojected become explanation94

herodotus mythedit
although herodotus considered inquiries serious pursuit knowledge relating entertaining tales derived collective body myth judiciously regard historical method corroborating stories enquiry testing probability95 gods never make personal appearances account human events herodotus states emphatically many things prove gods take part affairs
book passages herodotus relates story arion renowned harp player second living time saved dolphin herodotus prefaces story noting wonderful thing said happened alleges veracity adding corinthians lesbians agree account matter become rich court periander arion conceived desire sail italy sicily hired vessel crewed corinthians felt could trust sailors plotted throw overboard seize wealth arion discovered plot begged life crew gave options either kill spot jump ship fend arion flung water dolphin carried shore96
herodotus clearly writes historian teller tales indeed herodotus takes fluid position artistic storyweaving homer rational dataaccounting later historians john herrington developed helpful metaphor describing herodotuss dynamic position history western thought herodotus centaur

human forepart animal urbane responsible classical historian body indissolubly united something faraway mountains older freer wilder realm conventions force97

herodotus neither mere gatherer data simple teller tales herodotus certainly concerned giving accurate accounts events preclude insertion powerful mythological elements narrative elements expressing truth matters study thus understand herodotus histories must impose strict demarcations mythologist historian work myth work history james romm written herodotus worked common ancient greek cultural assumption events remembered retold myths legends produces valid kind understanding even retelling entirely factual98 herodotus takes myth history produce truthful understanding
