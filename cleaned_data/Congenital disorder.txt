classificationedit
much language used describing congenital conditions predates genomic mapping structural conditions often considered separately congenital conditions known many metabolic conditions subtle structural expression structural conditions often genetic links still congenital conditions often classified structural basis organized possible primary organ system affectedcitation needed
primarily structuraledit
several terms used describe congenital abnormalities also used describe noncongenital conditions term apply individual condition
terminologyedit

congenital physical anomaly abnormality structure body part anomaly perceived problem condition many people minor physical anomalies examined carefully examples minor anomalies include curvature finger clinodactyly third nipple tiny indentations skin near ears preauricular pits shortness metacarpal metatarsal bones dimples lower spine sacral dimples minor anomalies clues significant internal abnormalities
birth defect widely used term congenital malformation congenital physical anomaly recognizable birth significant enough considered problem according birth defects believed caused complex factors including genetics environment behaviors13 though many birth defects known cause example birth defect cleft palate occurs fourth seventh week gestation14 body tissue special cells side head grow toward center face join together make face14 cleft means split separation roof mouth called palate15
congenital malformation congenital physical anomaly deleterious structural defect perceived problem typical combination malformations affecting body part referred malformation syndrome
conditions abnormal tissue development

malformation associated disorder tissue development16 malformations often occur first trimester
dysplasia disorder organ level problems tissue development16


also possible conditions arise tissue formed

deformation condition arising mechanical stress normal tissue16 deformations often occur second third trimester oligohydramnios


disruption involves breakdown normal tissues16
multiple effects occur specified order known sequence order known syndrome

toxic substancesedit
drinking water often vessel harmful toxins travel studies shown heavy metals elements nitrates nitrites fluoride carried water cause congenital disorders
nitrate found mostly drinking water ground sources powerful teratogen casecontrol study rural australia conducted following frequent reports prenatal mortality congenital malformations found drank nitrateinfected groundwater opposed rain water risk giving birth children central nervous system disorders muscoskeletal defects cardiac defects38
chlorinated aromatic solvents benzene trichloroethylene sometimes enter water supply oversights waste disposal casecontrol study area found 1986 leukemia occurring children woburn massachusetts rate four times expected rate incidence investigation revealed connection high occurrence leukemia error water distribution delivered water town significant contamination manufacturing waste containing trichloroethylene39 endocrine disruptor shown induce miscarriages interfere development female reproductive system cause congenital hypothyroidism suspectibly childhood obesity34
fluoride transmitted water high levels also teratogen reports fluoride exposure china controlled account education level parents found children born parents exposed fluoride grew average seven points lower counterparts whose parents consumed water contained fluoride studies conducted rats higher fluoride drinking water lead increased acetylcholinesterase levels alter prenatal brain development significant effects noted level ppm40
fetus even susceptible damage carbon monoxide intake harmful inhaled pregnancy usually first secondhand tobacco smoke concentration carbon monoxide infant born nonsmoking mother around concentration drastically increases range mother smokes tobacco possible sources prenatal carbon monoxide intoxication exhaust combustion motors dichloromethane paint thinner varnish removers enclosed areas defective water heaters indoor barbeques open flames poorlyventilated areas atmospheric exposure highly polluted areas exposure carbon monoxide toxic levels first trimesters pregnancy lead intrauterine growth restriction leading baby stunted growth born smaller babies gestational effect chronic exposure carbon monoxide depend stage pregnancy mother exposed exposure embryonic stage neurological consequences telencephalic dysgenesis behavioral difficulties infancy reduction cerebellum volume also possible skeletal defects could result exposure carbon monoxide embryonic stage hand foot malformations dysplasia subluxation agenisis limb inferior maxillary atresia glossoptosis also carbon monoxide exposure days embryonic development lead increased risk child developing cleft palate exposure carbon monoxide polluted ozone exposure also lead cardiac defects ventrical septal pulmonary artery heart valves41 effects carbon monoxide exposure decreased later fetal development fetal stage still lead anoxic encephalopathy42
industrial pollution also lead congenital defects period years chisso corporation petrochemical plastics company contaminated waters minamata estimated tons methylmercury contaminating local water supply many people area developing became known “minamata disease” methylmercury teratogen mercury poisoning residing resulted neurological defects offspring infants exposed mercury poisoning utero showed predispositions cerebral palsy ataxia inhibited psychomotor development mental retardation43
landfill sites shown adverse effects fetal development extensive research shown landfills several negative effects babies born mothers living near landfill sites birth weight birth defects spontaneous abortion fetal infant mortality studies done around love canal site near niagara falls lipari landfill jersey shown higher proportion birth babies communities farther away landfills study done california showed positive correlation time quantity dumping birth weights neonatal deaths study united kingdom showed correspondence pregnant women living near landfill sites increased risk congenital disorders neural tube defects hypospadias epispadia abdominal wall defects gastroschisis exomphalos study conducted welsh community also showed increase incidence gastroschisis another study done twentyone european hazardous waste sites showed living within three kilometers increased risk giving birth infants birth defects distance land increased risk decreased birth defects included neural tube defects malformations cardiac septa anomalies arteries veins chromosomal anomalies44 looking communities live near landfill sites brings environmental justice vast majority sites located near poor mostly black communities example early 1920s 1978 houston’s population black however landfills incinerators time located black communities45
another issue regarding environmental justice lead poisoning fetus exposed lead pregnancy result learning difficulties slowed growth paints 1978 pipes contain lead therefore pregnant women live homes lead paint inhale dust containing lead leading lead exposure fetus lead pipes used drinking water cooking water water ingested along lead exposing fetus toxin issue prevalent poorer communities well families able afford homes repainted pipes renovated46
smokingedit
paternal smoking prior conception linked increased risk congenital abnormalities offspring23
smoking causes mutations germline father inherited offspring cigarette smoke acts chemical mutagen germ cell germ cells suffer oxidative damage effects seen altered mrna production infertility issues side effects embryonic fetal stages development oxidative damage result epigenetic genetic modifications fathers germline research shown fetal lymphocytes damaged result fathers smoking habits prior conception3129
correlations paternal smoking increased risk offspring developing childhood cancers including acute leukemia brain tumors lymphoma five established however research needed confirm findings little currently known paternal smoking damages fetus window time father smokes harmful offspring29
infectionsedit
main article vertically transmitted infection
vertically transmitted infection infection caused bacteria viruses rare cases parasites transmitted directly mother embryo fetus baby pregnancy childbirth occur mother gets infection intercurrent disease pregnancy
congenital disorders initially believed result hereditary factors however early 1940s australian pediatric ophthalmologist norman gregg began recognizing pattern infants arriving surgery developing congenital cataracts higher rate developed hereditary factors october 1941 gregg delivered paper explained findings68 children afflicted congenital cataracts exposed utero outbreak australian army camps findings confirmed gregg could fact environmental causes congenital disorders
rubella known cause abnormalities internal heart sometimes teeth specifically fetal exposure rubella weeks five development sixth week particularly cause cataracts microphthalmia eyes mother infected rubella ninth week crucial week internal development destruction organ corti causing deafness heart ductus arteriosus remain birth leading hypertension rubella also lead atrial ventricular septal defects heart exposed rubella second trimester fetus develop central nervous system malformations however infections rubella remain undetected misdiagnosed unrecognized mother andor abnormalities evident later child’s life precise incidence birth defects rubella entirely known timing mother’s infection fetal development determines risk type birth defect embryo develops risk abnormalities decreases exposed rubella virus first four weeks risk malformations percent exposure weeks five eight creates percent chance weeks nine twelve seven percent chance exists followed percentage exposure thirteenth sixteenth weeks exposure first eight weeks development also lead prematurity fetal death numbers calculated immediate inspection infant birth therefore mental defects accounted percentages evident later child’s life included numbers would much higher47
infectious agents include cytomegalovirus herpes simplex virus hyperthermia toxoplasmosis syphilis mother exposure cytomegalovirus cause microcephaly cerebral calcifications blindness chorioretinitis cause blindness hepatosplenomegaly meningoencephalitis fetuses47 microcephaly disorder fetus atypically small head48 cerebral calcifications means certain areas brain atypical calcium deposits49 meningoencephalitis enlargement brain three disorders cause abnormal brain function mental retardation hepatosplenomegaly enlargement liver spleen causes digestive problems50 also cause kernicterus petechiae kernicterus causes yellow pigmentation skin brain damage deafness51 petechaie capillaries bleed resulting redpurple spots skin52 however cytomegalovirus often fatal embryo
herpes simplex virus cause microcephaly microphthalmus abnormally small eyeballs53 retinal dysplasia hepatosplenomegaly mental retardation47 microphthalmus retinal dysplasia cause blindness however common symptom infants inflammatory response develops first three weeks life47 hyperthermia causes anencephaly part brain skull absent infant4754 mother exposure toxoplasmosis cause cerebral calcification hydrocephalus causes mental disabilities55 mental retardation infants birth abnormalities reported well chorioretinitis microphthalmus ocular defects syphilis causes congenital deafness mental retardation diffuse fibrosis organs liver lungs embryo exposed47
lack nutrientsedit
information nutrition pregnancy
example lack folic acid vitamin diet mother cause cellular neural tube deformities result spina bifida congenital disorders neural tube deformity prevented mother consumes milligrams folic acid conception weeks pregnancy56 folic acid vitamin aids development foetal nervous system56
studies mice found food deprivation male mouse prior conception leads offspring displaying significantly lower blood glucose levels57
physical restraintedit
external physical shocks constrainment growth restricted space result unintended deformation separation cellular structures resulting abnormal final shape damaged structures unable function expected example potter syndrome oligohydramnios finding important future understandings genetics predispose individuals diseases like obesity diabetes cancer
multicellular organisms develop womb physical interference presence similarly developing organisms twins result cellular masses integrated larger whole combined cells attempting continue develop manner satisfies intended growth patterns cell masses cellular masses compete either duplicate merge various structures results conditions conjoined twins resulting merged organism birth must leave lifesustaining environment womb must attempt sustain biological processes independently
genetic causesedit
main article genetic disorder
genetic causes congenital anomalies include inheritance abnormal genes mother father well mutations germ cells gave rise fetus male germ cells mutate much faster rate female germ cells father ages germ cells mutates quickly5828 fertilized sperm damaged possibility fetus could develop abnormally5859
genetic disorders diseases congenital though expressed recognized later life genetic diseases divided singlegene defects multiplegene disorders chromosomal defects singlegene defects arise abnormalities copies autosomal gene recessive disorder copies dominant disorder conditions result deletions abnormalities genes located contiguously chromosome chromosomal disorders involve loss duplication larger portions chromosome entire chromosome containing hundreds genes large chromosomal abnormalities always produce effects many different body parts organ systems
socioeconomic statusedit
socioeconomic status deprived neighborhood include exposure “environmental stressors risk factors”60 socioeconomic inequalities commonly measured cartairsmorris score index multiple deprivation townsend deprivation index jarman score61 jarman score example considers “unemployment overcrowding single parents underfives elderly living alone ethnicity social class residential mobility”61 vos’ metaanalysis indices used view effect neighborhoods maternal health metaanalysis data individual studies collected 1985 200861 concludes correlation exists prenatal adversities deprived neighborhoods61 studies shown closely associated development fetus utero growth retardation62 studies also suggest children born families “likely born prematurely birth weight asphyxia birth defect disability fetal alcohol syndrome aids”62 bradley corwyn also suggest congenital disorders arise mother’s lack nutrition poor lifestyle maternal substance abuse “living neighborhood contains hazards affecting fetal development toxic waste dumps”62 metaanalysis viewed inequalities influenced maternal health suggested deprived neighborhoods often promoted behaviors smoking drug alcohol use60 controlling socioeconomic factors ethnicity several individual studies demonstrated association outcomes perinatal mortality preterm birth60
radiationedit
survivors atomic bombing hiroshima nagasaki known hibakusha statistically demonstrable increase birth defectscongenital malformations found among later conceived children found later conceived children cancer survivors previously received radiotherapy636465 surviving women hiroshima nagasaki able conceive though exposed substantial amounts radiation later children higher incidence abnormalitiesbirth defects japanese population whole6768
relatively studies researched effects paternal radiation exposure offspring following chernobyl disaster assumed 1990s germ line irradiated fathers suffered minisatellite mutations inherited descendants2469 recently however world health organization states children conceived fathers exposure showed statistically significant differences mutation frequencies70 statistically insignificant increase also seen independent researchers analyzing children liquidators71 animal studies shown incomparably massive doses xray irradiation male mice resulted birth defects offspring31
1980s relatively high prevalence pediatric leukemia cases children living near nuclear processing plant west cumbria researchers investigate whether cancer result paternal radiation exposure significant association paternal irradiation offspring cancer found research areas close nuclear processing plants produce results3124 later determined seascale cluster leading hypothesis influx foreign workers different rate leukemia within race british average resulted observed cluster children expected around cumbria72
fathers ageedit
main article paternal effect
effects paternal offspring well understood studied less extensively effects maternal age73 fathers contribute proportionally mutations offspring germ cells mother paternal governing many mutations passed humans male germ cells acquire mutations much faster rate female germ cells583128
around increase incidence ventricular septal defects atrial septal defects patent ductus arteriosus offspring found correlated advanced paternal advanced paternal also linked increased risk achondroplasia apert syndrome offspring born fathers show increased risk affected patent ductus arteriosus ventricular septal defects tetralogy fallot hypothesized environmental exposures lifestyle choices73
research found correlation advanced paternal risk birth defects limb anomalies syndromes involving multiple systems downs syndrome582874 recent studies concluded downs syndrome cases paternal effects findings controversial58592875
concrete evidence advanced paternal associated increased likelihood mother suffer miscarriage fetal death occur58
unknownedit
although significant progress made identifying etiology birth defects approximately known identifiable cause27 referred sporadic term implies unknown cause random occurrence regardless maternal living conditions76 recurrence risk future children 2025 anomalies seems multifactorial cause meaning complex interaction multiple minor genetic anomalies environmental risk factors another 10–13 anomalies purely environmental cause infections illness drug abuse mother 12–25 anomalies purely genetic cause majority chromosomal anomalies77
