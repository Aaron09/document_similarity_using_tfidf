hydrologyedit
winter season usually little inflow freshwater surface water deeper water meters mixed winter steady cooling surface wind deep fjords still fresh water summer less density saltier water along coast offshore wind common fjord areas winter sets current surface inner outer parts current surface turn pulls dense salt water coast across fjord threshold deepest parts fjord14
summer season usually large inflow river water inner areas freshwater gets mixed saltwater creating layer brackish water slightly higher surface ocean turn sets current river mouths towards ocean current gradually salty towards coast right surface current reverse current saltier water coast deeper parts fjord cold water remaining winter still separated atmosphere brackish layer fjords shallow threshold deep water replaced every year oxygen concentration makes deep water unsuitable fish animals extreme cases constant barrier freshwater surface fjord freezes oxygen surface drammensfjorden example14

coral reefsedit
late 2000 coral reefs discovered along bottoms norwegian fjords16 reefs found fjords north norway south marine life reefs believed important reasons norwegian coastline generous fishing ground since discovery fairly little research done reefs host thousands lifeforms plankton coral anemones fish several species shark many specially adapted life greater pressure water column total darkness deep sea17
zealands fjords also host deepwater corals surface layer dark fresh water allows corals grow much shallower water usual underwater observatory milford sound allows tourists view without diving18
skerriesedit
places near seaward margins areas fjords icescoured channels numerous varied direction rocky coast divided thousands island blocks large mountainous others merely rocky points rock reefs menacing navigation called skerries17 term skerry derived norse sker means rock sea19
skerries commonly formed outlet fjords submerged glacially formed valleys perpendicular coast join cross valleys complex array island fringe norway group skerries called skjærgård many cross fjords arranged parallel coast provide protected channel behind almost unbroken succession mountainous islands skerries channel travel protected passage almost entire 1601 route stavanger north cape norway blindleia skerryprotected waterway starts near kristiansand southern norway continues past lillesand swedish coast along bohuslän likewise skerry guarded inside passage provides similar route seattle washington vancouver british columbia skagway alaska another skerry protected passage extends straits magellan north
