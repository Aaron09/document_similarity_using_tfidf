purpose abilitiesedit
architectureindependent system remote graphical user interfaces input device capabilities person using networked terminal ability interact display type user input device
standard distribution complete albeit simple display interface solution delivers standard toolkit protocol stack building graphical user interfaces unixlike operating systems openvms ported many contemporary general purpose operating systems
provides basic framework primitives building environments drawing moving windows display interacting mouse keyboard touchscreen mandate user interface individual client programs handle programs graphical abilities user interface visual styling xbased environments varies greatly different programs present radically different interfaces
unlike earlier display protocols specifically designed used network connections rather integral attached display device features network transparency means program running computer somewhere network internet display user interface server running computer network server typically provider graphics resources keyboardmouse events clients meaning server usually running computer front human user client applications anywhere network communicate users computer request rendering graphics content receive events input devices including keyboards mice
fact term server applied software front user often surprising users accustomed programs clients services remote computers rather remote database resource local users graphic display input devices become resources made available local server local remotely hosted client programs need share users graphics input devices communicate user
network protocol based command primitives approach allows extensions like operations client application might running different computer still fully accelerated servers display example classic opengl version display lists containing large numbers objects could constructed stored entirely server remote client program rendered sending single glcalllistwhich across network
provides native support audio several projects exist fill niche also providing transparent network support

client–server terminology users terminal server applications clients often confuses users terms appear reversed takes perspective application rather enduser provides display services applications server applications services thus clients
communication protocol server client operates networktransparently client server machine different ones possibly different architectures operating systems client server even communicate securely internet tunneling connection encrypted network session
client emulate server providing display services clients known nesting opensource clients xnest xephyr support nesting
client application remote machine user following

local machine open terminal window
forwarding argument connect remote machine
request local displayinput service export displayusers machine0 using forwarding enabled

remote client application make connection users local server providing display input user
alternatively local machine small program connects remote machine starts client application
practical examples remote clients include

administering remote machine graphically similar using remote desktop single windows
using client application join large numbers terminal users collaborative workgroups
running computationally intensive simulation remote machine displaying results local desktop machine
running graphical software several machines controlled single display keyboard mouse

principlesedit
1984 scheifler gettys early principles

functionality unless implementor cannot complete real application without
important decide system decide serve worlds needs rather make system extensible additional needs upwardly compatible fashion
thing worse generalizing example generalizing examples

percent desired effect percent work simpler solution also worse better
isolate complexity much possible
provide mechanism rather policy particular place user interface policy clients hands

client–server separationedit
design requires clients server operate separately device independence separation client server incur overhead overhead comes network roundtrip delay time client server latency rather protocol best solutions performance issues depend efficient application design10 common criticism network features result excessive complexity decreased performance used locally
modern implementations unix domain sockets efficient connections host additionally shared memory mitshm extension employed faster client–server communication11 however programmer must still explicitly activate shared memory extension also necessary provide fallback paths order stay compatible older implementations order communicate nonlocal servers

date 1984 0907edt tuesday

spent last couple weeks writing window
system vs100 stole fair amount code
surrounded asynchronous rather
synchronous interface called overall
performance appears twice
code seems fairly solid point although
still deficiencies fixed

stopped using
actively building applications anyone else using
seriously consider switching
ultimate window system believe good
starting point experimentation right moment
argus interface
interface works three existing
applications text editor argus
interface primitive window manager
documentation anyone crazy enough
volunteer around eventually

anyone interested seeing demo drop
