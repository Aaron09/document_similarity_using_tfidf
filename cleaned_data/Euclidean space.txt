intuitive overviewedit
think euclidean plane points satisfying certain relationships expressible terms distance angle example fundamental operations referred motions plane translation means shifting plane every point shifted direction distance rotation fixed point plane every point plane turns fixed point angle basic tenets euclidean geometry figures usually considered subsets plane considered equivalent congruent transformed sequence translations rotations reflections
order make mathematically precise theory must clearly define notions distance angle translation rotation mathematically described space even used physical theories euclidean space abstraction detached actual physical locations specific reference frames measurement instruments purely mathematical definition euclidean space also ignores questions units length physical dimensions distance mathematical space number something expressed inches metres standard define space carried remainder article define euclidean plane twodimensional real vector space equipped inner product3 reason working arbitrary vector spaces instead often preferable work coordinatefree manner without choosing preferred basis

vectors vector space correspond points euclidean plane
addition operation vector space corresponds translation
inner product implies notions angle distance used define rotation

euclidean plane described language actually simple matter extend concept arbitrary dimensions part vocabulary formulae calculations made difficult presence dimensions however rotations subtle high dimensions visualizing highdimensional spaces remains difficult even experienced mathematicians
