slavery major cause disunion26 although opposing views even union states2728 northern soldiers largely indifferent subject slavery29 confederates fought largely protect southern society slavery integral part30 antislavery perspective issue primarily whether system slavery anachronistic evil incompatible republicanism strategy antislavery forces containment—to stop expansion thus slavery path gradual extinction31 slaveholding interests south denounced strategy infringing upon constitutional rights32 southern whites believed emancipation slaves would destroy souths economy large amount capital invested slaves fears integrating exslave black population33
slavery illegal much north outlawed late 18th early 19th centuries also fading border states southern cities expanding highly profitable cotton districts rural south southwest subsequent writers american civil looked several factors explaining geographic divide
sectionalism
sectionalism refers different economies social structure customs political values north south3435 increased steadily 1800 1860 north phased slavery existence industrialized urbanized built prosperous farms deep south concentrated plantation agriculture based slave labor together subsistence farming poor freedmen 1840s issue accepting slavery guise rejecting slaveowning bishops missionaries split nations largest religious denominations methodist baptist presbyterian churches separate northern southern denominations36
historians debated whether economic differences industrial northeast agricultural south helped cause historians disagree economic determinism historian charles beard 1920s emphasize northern southern economies largely complementary socially different sections economically benefited other3738

protectionism
historically southern slaveholding states cost manual labor little perceived need mechanization supported right sell cotton purchase manufactured goods nation northern states heavily invested stillnascent manufacturing could compete fullfledged industries europe offering high prices cotton imported south prices manufactured exports return thus northern manufacturing interests supported tariffs protectionism southern planters demanded free trade39
democrats congress controlled southerners wrote tariff laws 1830s 1840s 1850s kept reducing rates 1857 rates lowest since 1816 whigs republicans complained favored high tariffs stimulate industrial growth republicans called increase tariffs 1860 election increases enacted 1861 southerners resigned seats congress4041 tariff issue sometimes cited–long war–by lost cause historians neoconfederate apologists 1860–61 none groups proposed compromises head secession raised tariff issue42 pamphleteers north south rarely mentioned tariff43 instance matthew fontaine maury44 john lothrop motley45 generally writing foreign audience
states rights
south argued state right secede—leave union—at time constitution compact agreement among states northerners including president buchanan rejected notion opposed founding fathers said setting perpetual union46 historian james mcpherson writes concerning states rights nonslavery explanations

interpretations remain popular among sons confederate veterans southern heritage groups professional historians subscribe interpretations statesrights argument perhaps weakest fails question states rights purpose states rights sovereignty always means instrument achieve certain goal principle47

territorial crisis

conquest northern mexico west california 1848 slaveholding interests looked forward expanding lands perhaps cuba central america well4950 northern free soil interests vigorously sought curtail expansion slave territory compromise 1850 california balanced free soil state stronger fugitive slave laws political settlement four years strife 1840s states admitted following california free minnesota 1858 oregon 1859 kansas 1861 southern states question territorial expansion slavery westward became explosive51 south north drew conclusion power decide question slavery territories power determine future slavery itself5253
