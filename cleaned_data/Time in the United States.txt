historyedit
prior adoption four standard time zones continental united states many towns cities clocks based sunsets sunrises locations observing suns zenith noon mean solar time dawn dusk occur different times time differences distant locations barely noticeable prior 19th century long travel times lack longdistance instant communications prior development telegraph
local solar time became increasingly awkward railways telecommunications improved1 american railroads maintained many different time zones late 1800s train station clock making difficult coordinate train schedules confusing passengers time calculation became serious problem people travelling train sometimes hundreds miles according library congress every city united states used different time standard local times choose time zones therefore compromise relaxing complex geographic dependence still allowing local time approximate mean solar time railroad managers tried address problem establishing railroad time zones partial solution problem1
operators railroad lines needed time plan would offer uniform train schedule departures arrivals four standard time zones continental united states introduced noon november 1883 telegraph lines transmitted time signals major cities2
