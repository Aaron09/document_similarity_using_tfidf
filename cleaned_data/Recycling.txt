recycling process converting waste materials materials objects alternative conventional waste disposal save material help lower greenhouse emissions compared plastic production12 example recycling prevent waste potentially useful materials reduce consumption fresh materials thereby reducing energy usage pollution incineration water pollution landfilling

recyclable materials include many kinds glass paper cardboard metal plastic tires textiles electronics composting reuse biodegradable waste—such food garden waste—is also considered recycling2 materials recycled either brought collection center picked curbside sorted cleaned reprocessed materials destined manufacturing
strictest sense recycling material would produce fresh supply material—for example used office paper would converted office paper used polystyrene foam polystyrene however often difficult expensive compared producing product materials sources recycling many products materials involves reuse producing different materials example paperboard instead another form recycling salvage certain materials complex products either intrinsic value lead batteries gold circuit boards hazardous nature removal reuse mercury thermometers thermostats

legislationedit
supplyedit
recycling program work large stable supply recyclable material crucial three legislative options used create supply mandatory recycling collection container deposit legislation refuse bans mandatory collection laws recycling targets cities usually form certain percentage material must diverted citys waste stream target date city responsible working meet target2
container deposit legislation involves offering refund return certain containers typically glass plastic metal product container purchased small surcharge added price surcharge reclaimed consumer container returned collection point programs successful often resulting percent recycling rate26 despite good results shift collection costs local government industry consumers created strong opposition creation programs areas2 variation manufacturer bears responsibility recycling goods european union weee directive requires producers consumer electronics reimburse recyclers costs27
alternative increase supply recyclates disposal certain materials waste often including used batteries tires garden waste method create viable economy proper disposal banned products care must taken enough recycling services exist bans simply lead increased illegal dumping2
governmentmandated demandedit
legislation also used increase maintain demand recycled materials four methods legislation exist minimum recycled content mandates utilization rates procurement policies recycled product labeling2
minimum recycled content mandates utilization rates increase demand directly forcing manufacturers include recycling operations content mandates specify certain percentage product must consist recycled material utilization rates flexible option industries permitted meet recycling targets point operation even contract recycling exchange tradeable credits opponents methods point large increase reporting requirements impose claim industry necessary flexibility228
governments used purchasing power increase recycling demand called procurement policies policies either setasides reserve certain amount spending solely towards recycled products price preference programs provide larger budget recycled items purchased additional regulations target specific cases united states example environmental protection agency mandates purchase paper tires building insulation recycled rerefined sources whenever possible2
final government regulation towards increased demand recycled product labeling producers required label packaging amount recycled material product including packaging consumers better able make educated choices consumers sufficient buying power choose environmentally conscious options prompt producers increase amount recycled material products indirectly increase demand standardized recycling labeling also positive effect supply recyclates labeling includes information product recycled2

curbside collection encompasses many subtly different systems differ mostly process recyclates sorted cleaned main categories mixed waste collection commingled recyclables source separation2 waste collection vehicle generally picks waste
spectrum mixed waste collection recyclates collected mixed rest waste desired material sorted cleaned central sorting facility results large amount recyclable waste paper especially soiled reprocess advantages well city need separate collection recyclates public education needed changes materials recyclable easy accommodate sorting happens central location2
commingled singlestream system recyclables collection mixed kept separate waste greatly reduces need postcollection cleaning require public education materials recyclable26
source separation extreme material cleaned sorted prior collection method requires least postcollection sorting produces purest recyclates incurs additional operating costs collection separate material extensive public education program also required must successful recyclate contamination avoided2
source separation used preferred method high sorting costs incurred commingled mixed waste collection however advances sorting technology lowered overhead substantially many areas developed source separation programs since switched whats called comingled collection6
