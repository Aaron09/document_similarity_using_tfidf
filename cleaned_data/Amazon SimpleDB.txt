simpledb provides eventual consistency weaker form consistency compared database management systems often considered limitation harder reason makes harder write correct programs make simpledb limitation result fundamental design tradeoff foregoing consistency system able achieve highly desirable properties

availability components system fail service continue operate correctly
partition tolerance components system connected another computer network components able contact another using network condition known network partition operation system continue

component failures assumed inevitable thus properties deemed necessary order provide reliable service theorem states possible system exhibit properties along consistency thus designers needed settle weaker form consistency

conditional deleteedit
conditional conditional delete operations added february 2010 address problem arises accessing simpledb concurrently consider simple program uses simpledb store counter number incremented program must three things

retrieve current value counter simpledb
value
store value place value simpledb

program runs programs access simpledb work correctly however often desirable software applications particularly applications access data concurrently data accessed concurrently race condition arises would result undetectable data loss
continuing previous example consider processes running program suppose simpledb services requests data described step value lets current value counter steps store thus final counter value even though expected final counter value system attempted increment operations another
problem solved conditional suppose change step follows instead unconditionally storing value program asks simpledb store value value currently holds value retrieved step sure counters value actually increases introduces additional complexity simpledb able store value current value expected program must repeat steps conditional operation actually changes stored value
consistent readedit
consistent read feature released time conditional conditional delete name suggests consistent read addresses problems arise simpledbs eventual consistency model limitations section consider following sequence operations

program stores data simpledb
immediately requests data stored

simpledbs eventual consistency guarantee allow data retrieved step reflects updates made step eventual consistency guarantees step reflects complete updates step none updates consistent read used ensure data retrieved step reflect changes step
reason inconsistent results arise consistent read operation used simpledb stores data multiple locations availability data step might written locations simpledb receives data request step case possible data request step serviced locations data written
amazon discourages consistent read unless required correctness reason recommendation rate consistent read operations serviced lower regular reads
