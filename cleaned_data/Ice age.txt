evidence ages
three main types evidence ages geological chemical paleontological
geological evidence ages comes various forms including rock scouring scratching glacial moraines drumlins valley cutting deposition till tillites glacial erratics successive glaciations tend distort erase geological evidence making difficult interpret furthermore evidence difficult date exactly early theories assumed glacials short compared long interglacials advent sediment cores revealed true situation glacials long interglacials short took time current theory worked
chemical evidence mainly consists variations ratios isotopes fossils present sediments sedimentary rocks ocean sediment cores recent glacial periods cores provide climate proxies atmospheric samples included bubbles water containing heavier isotopes higher heat evaporation proportion decreases colder conditions29 allows temperature record constructed however evidence confounded factors recorded isotope ratios
paleontological evidence consists changes geographical distribution fossils glacial period coldadapted organisms spread lower latitudes organisms prefer warmer conditions become extinct squeezed lower latitudes evidence also difficult interpret requires sequences sediments covering long period time wide range latitudes easily correlated ancient organisms survive several million years without change whose temperature preferences easily diagnosed finding relevant fossils
despite difficulties analysis core ocean sediment cores30 shown periods glacials interglacials past million years also confirm linkage ages continental crust phenomena glacial moraines drumlins glacial erratics hence continental crust phenomena accepted good evidence earlier ages found layers created much earlier time range cores ocean sediment cores available

positive negative feedback glacial periods
glacial period subject positive feedback makes severe negative feedback mitigates cases eventually ends
positive feedback processes
snow increase earths albedo make reflect suns energy absorb less hence temperature decreases snow fields grow continues competition negative feedback mechanism forces system equilibrium also reduction forests caused ices expansion increases albedo
another theory proposed ewing donn 195641 hypothesized icefree arctic ocean leads increased snowfall high latitudes lowtemperature covers arctic ocean little evaporation sublimation polar regions quite terms precipitation comparable amount found midlatitude deserts precipitation allows highlatitude snowfalls melt summer icefree arctic ocean absorbs solar radiation long summer days evaporates water arctic atmosphere higher precipitation portions snow melt summer glacial form lower altitudes southerly latitudes reducing temperatures land increased albedo noted furthermore hypothesis lack oceanic pack allows increased exchange waters arctic north atlantic oceans warming arctic cooling north atlantic current projected consequences global warming include largely icefree arctic ocean within 5–20 years arctic shrinkage additional fresh water flowing north atlantic warming cycle also reduce global ocean water circulation reduction reducing effects gulf stream would cooling effect northern europe turn would lead increased lowlatitude snow retention summer also suggested extensive glacial glaciers move gulf saint lawrence extending north atlantic ocean enough block gulf stream
negative feedback processes
sheets form glaciations cause erosion land beneath time reduce land level thus diminish amount space sheets form mitigates albedo feedback lowering level accompanies formation sheetscitation needed
another factor increased aridity occurring glacial maxima reduces precipitation available maintain glaciation glacial retreat induced process amplified similar inverse positive feedbacks glacial advances42
according research published nature geoscience human emissions carbon dioxide defer next researchers used data earths orbit find historical warm interglacial period looks like current predicted next would usually begin within 1500 years emissions high not43
causes ages
causes ages fully understood either largescale periods smaller flow glacial–interglacial periods within consensus several factors important atmospheric composition concentrations carbon dioxide methane specific levels previously mentioned gases able seen core samples epica dome antarctica past 800000 years changes earths orbit around known milankovitch cycles motion tectonic plates resulting changes relative location amount continental oceanic crust earths surface affect wind ocean currents variations solar output orbital dynamics earth–moon system impact relatively large meteorites volcanism including eruptions supervolcanoes44citation needed

snowball earth hypothesis maintains severe freezing late proterozoic ended increase levels atmosphere mainly volcanoes supporters snowball earth argue caused first place reduction atmospheric hypothesis also warns future snowball earths
2009 evidence provided changes solar insolation provide initial trigger earth warm secondary factors like increases greenhouse gases accounting magnitude change47
humaninduced changes
considerable evidence recent period last 100–1000 years sharp increases human activity especially burning fossil fuels caused parallel sharp accelerating increase atmospheric greenhouse gases trap suns heat consensus theory scientific community resulting greenhouse effect principal cause increase global warming occurred period chief contributor accelerated melting remaining glaciers polar 2012 investigation finds dinosaurs released methane digestion similar amount humanitys current methane release could factor warm climate million years ago48

position continents
geological record appears show ages start continents positions block reduce flow warm water equator poles thus allow sheets form sheets increase earths reflectivity thus reduce absorption solar radiation less radiation absorbed atmosphere cools cooling allows sheets grow increases reflectivity positive feedback loop continues reduction weathering causes increase greenhouse effect
three main contributors layout continents obstruct movement warm water polescitation needed

continent sits pole antarctica today
polar almost landlocked arctic ocean today
supercontinent covers equator rodinia cryogenian period

since todays earth continent south pole almost landlocked ocean north pole geologists believe earth continue experience glacial periods geologically near future
scientists believe himalayas major factor current mountains increased earths total rainfall therefore rate carbon dioxide washed atmosphere decreasing greenhouse effect46 himalayas formation started million years indoaustralian plate collided eurasian plate himalayas still rising year indoaustralian plate still moving mmyear history himalayas broadly fits longterm decrease earths average temperature since mideocene million years
