synoptics sources gospel mark triple tradition double tradition material unique matthew source luke source mark7


stages oral tradition written gospeledit
main articles synoptic problem oral gospel traditions
gospels written accounts career teachings jesus nazareth1 immediate aftermath jesus death followers expected return moment certainly within lifetimes consequence little motivation write anything future generations eyewitnesses began missionary needs church grew increasing demand need written versions founders life teachings8 stages process summarised follows9

oral traditions stories sayings passed largely separate selfcontained units chronological order
written collections miracle stories parables sayings oral tradition continuing alongside
protogospels preceding serving sources written gospels dedicatory preface luke example testifies existence several previous accounts life jesus10
gospels formed combining protogospels written collections stillcurrent oral tradition

given history almost certain none four gospels written eyewitnesses11 evidence seen conflicts take examples according synoptic gospels jesus mission took year spent primarily galilee climaxed single visit jerusalem cleansed temple moneychangers john jerusalem focus jesus mission visited three times making mission last three years rather cleansing temple took place beginning rather ministry12
compositionedit
main article synoptic gospels
first three gospels called synoptics greek phrase meaning seen together events jesus life order many stories sayings often similar words13 usual explaining mark written first authors matthew luke acting independently used mark plus collection sayings called document additional material unique called source matthew source luke14notes
mark probably written 66–70 neros persecution christians rome jewish revolt15 although christian tradition ascribes john mark companion interpreter apostle peter modern scholars regard authorship unknown1617 general consensus matthew luke written around 85–9018 consensus equally rejected idea luke written companion paul apostle19 matthew apostle superscription according matthew added time century2021 author gospel john known synoptic gospels matthew luke used mark22 last four canonical gospels usually dated 90–11023 christian tradition identified author john apostle modern scholars treat anonymous work24
four gospels share story earthly career jesus culminates death bodily resurrection event crucial redemptive significance25 four nevertheless present different narratives reflecting different intents parts authors26 obvious contrast john three synoptics relate basic storyline john baptist resurrection jesus within overall framework present completely different pictures jesus career27 john baptism jesus temptation transfiguration jesus lacks institution lords supper stories jesus ancestry birth childhood27 jesuss career synoptics takes single year john takes three john cleansing temple takes place beginning ministry synoptics happens synoptics last supper takes place passover meal john happens passover28 mark first gospel never calls jesus claims jesus existed prior earthly life never mentions virgin birth author apparently believes jesus normal human parentage birth makes attempt trace jesus ancestry back king david adam29 crucially mark originally postresurrection appearances jesus30 although mark young discovered tomb instructs women tell disciples peter jesus galilee hints author known tradition31
matthew reinterprets mark32 stressing jesus teachings much acts33 making subtle changes narrative order stress divine nature marks young appears jesus tomb example becomes radiant angel matthew34 miracle stories mark confirm jesus status emissary marks understanding messiah matthew demonstrate divinity35 luke following marks plot faithfully matthew expanded source corrected marks grammar syntax eliminating passages entirely notably chapters apparently felt reflected poorly disciples painted jesus much like magician36
synoptic gospels represent jesus exorcist healer preached parables coming kingdom preached first galilee later jerusalem cleansed temple states offers sign proof mark sign jonah matthew luke37 mark apparently written roman audience mind jesus heroic action given powerful emotions including agony38 matthew apparently written jewish audience jesus repeatedly called fulfillment hebrew prophecy38
luke apparently written gentiles jesus especially concerned poor38 luke emphasizes importance prayer action holy spirit jesuss life christian community39 jesus appears stoic supernatural unmoved even crucifixion40 like matthew luke insists salvation offered christ jews3941 gospel john gospel call jesus contrast mark jesus hides identity messiah john openly proclaims it42 represents jesus incarnation eternal word logos spoke parables talked extensively explicitly refer second coming38 jesus preaches jerusalem launching ministry cleansing temple performs several miracles signs found synoptics gospel john ends2125 also many things jesus written every suppose even world could contain books written amen

canonisationedit
creation christian canon probably response career heretic marcion 85–160 established canon gospel gospel luke edited theology51 muratorian canon earliest surviving list books considered author least form christian scripture included matthew mark luke john irenaeus lyons went stating must four gospels four four corners earth thus church four pillars352
noncanonical gospelsedit
epiphanius jerome early church fathers preserve writings citations jewishchristian gospels modern critical scholars consider extant citations suggest least probably three distinct works least possibly closely parallels gospel matthew53
gospel thomas mostly wisdom without narrating jesuss life oxford dictionary christian church says original date 15054 represent tradition independent canonical gospels developed long time influenced matthew luke54 understood gnostic terms lacks characteristic features gnostic doctrine54 includes unique parables parable empty parable assassin55 lost discovered coptic version dating hammadi 1945–46 three papyri dated contain fragments greek text similar identical coptic language also found54
gospel peter likely written first half century5657 seems largely legendary hostile toward jews including docetic elements56 narrative gospel notable asserting herod pontius pilate ordered crucifixion jesus lost rediscovered 19th century56
gospel judas another controversial ancient text purports tell story gospel perspective judas disciple usually said betrayed jesus paints unusual picture relationship jesus judas appears interpret judass betrayal rather obedience instructions jesus text recovered cave egypt thief thereafter sold black market finally discovered collector help academics yale princeton able verify authenticity document claim authored judas rather gospel judas known date least ad58
gospel mary originally written greek century often interpreted gnostic text consists mainly dialog mary magdalene disciples typically considered gospel scholars since focus life jesus59
genre infancy gospels greek protoevangelion arose century includes gospel james introduces concept perpetual virginity mary infancy gospel thomas confused absolutely different sayings gospel thomas related many miraculous incidents life mary childhood jesus included canonical gospels
another genre gospel harmonies four canonical gospels selectively recast single narrative present consistent text fragments harmonies survived diatessaron harmonization compiled tatian around popular least centuries syria eventually fell disuse
marcion sinope much shorter version gospel luke differing substantially become standard text gospel less oriented towards jewish scriptures marcion said rejected gospels including matthew mark especially john allegedly rejected forged irenaeus marcions critics alleged edited portions didnt like canonical version though marcion said argued text genuinely original written coptic contains oracles would used provide support reassurance people seeking help problems gospel traditional sense since doesn’t predominantly teach christ60
