identifiers back statue louvre


identifier name identifies labels identity either unique object unique class objects object class idea physical countable object class thereof physical noncountable substance class thereof abbreviation often refers identity identification process identifying identifier instance identification identifier word number letter symbol combination
words numbers letters symbols follow encoding system wherein letters digits words symbols stand represent ideas longer names simply arbitrary identifier follows encoding system often referred code code identifiers follow encoding scheme often said arbitrary arbitrarily assigned greater meaning sometimes identifiers called codes even actually arbitrary whether speaker believes deeper meaning simply speaking casually imprecisely
unique identifier identifier refers instance—only particular object universe part number identifier unique identifier—for serial number needed identify instance part design thus identifier model identifies class model automobiles fords model comprises whereas unique identifier model serial number 159862 identifies specific member class—that particular model owned specific person
concepts name identifier denotatively equal terms thus denotatively synonymous always connotatively synonymous code names numbers often connotatively distinguished names sense traditional natural language naming example jamie zawinski netscape employee number identifiers specific human normal englishlanguage connotation consider jamie zawinski name identifier whereas considers netscape employee number identifier name emic indistinction rather etic

metadataedit
metadata identifier languageindependent label sign token uniquely identifies object within identification scheme suffix identifier also used representation term naming data element
codes inherently carry metadata along example know food package front identifier 20110925t1542zmfr5p0224345 data also metadata tells packaged september 2011 342pm manufactured licensed vendor number peoria plant building 243rd package line shift inspected inspector number
arbitrary identifiers might lack metadata example food package says 100054678214 tell anything except identity—no date manufacturer name production sequence rank inspector number cases arbitrary identifiers sequential serial numbers leak information german tank problem opaque identifiers—identifiers designed avoid leaking even small amount information—include really opaque pointers version uuids
computer scienceedit
computer science identifiers lexical tokens name entities identifiers used extensively virtually information processing systems identifying entities makes possible refer essential kind symbolic processing
computer languagesedit
computer languages identifiers tokens also called symbols name language entities kinds entities identifier might denote include variables types labels subroutines packages
character sequences constitute identifiers depends lexical grammar language common rule alphanumeric sequences underscore also allowed condition begin digit simplify lexing avoiding confusing integer literals foo1 foobar allowed 1foo definition used earlier versions python many languages later versions languages along many modern languages support almost unicode characters identifier however common restriction permit whitespace characters language operators simplifies tokenization making freeform contextfree example forbidding identifiers binary operation means tokenized allowed would identifier addition whitespace identifier particularly problematic spaces allowed identifiers clause rainy legal rainy identifier tokenizing requires phrasal context condition clause languages allow spaces identifiers however algol algol variants example following valid statement real half could entered real half keywords represented boldface concretely stropping algol possible keywords syntactically differentiated risk collision ambiguity spaces eliminated line reconstruction phase source processed scannerless parsing lexing could contextsensitive
languages character sequences lexical form identifier known keywords example frequently keyword clause lexically form namely sequence letters overlap handled various ways forbidden identifiers simplifies tokenization parsing case reserved words allowed distinguished ways stropping keyword sequences allowed identifiers sense determined context requires contextsensitive lexer nonkeywords also reserved words forbidden identifiers particularly forward compatibility case word become keyword future languages distinction clear
scope accessibility within program identifier either local global global identifier declared outside functions available throughout program local identifier declared within specific function available within function1
implementations programming languages using compiler identifiers often compile time entities runtime compiled program contains references memory addresses offsets rather textual identifier tokens memory addresses offsets assigned compiler identifier
languages support reflection interactive evaluation source code using interpreter incremental compiler identifiers also runtime entities sometimes even firstclass objects freely manipulated evaluated lisp called symbols
compilers interpreters usually assign semantic meaning identifier based actual character sequence used however exceptions
example

perl variable indicated using prefix called sigil specifies aspects variable interpreted expressions
ruby variable automatically considered immutable identifier starts capital letter
fortran first letter variables name indicates whether default created integer floating point variable
capitalization first letter variables name determines visibility uppercase public lowercase private

languages identifiers uniqueness based spelling visibility2
html identifier possible attributes html element unique within document
ambiguityedit
identifiers versus unique identifiers uidsedit
main article unique identifier
many resources carry multiple identifiers typical examples

person multiple names nicknames forms address titles salutations

example specific person identified following identifiers jane smith jane elizabeth meredith smith jane smith jane smith janie smith janie little janie opposed mother sister cousin janie aunt jane auntie janie grandmom nana kellys mother billys grandmother smith smith jane smith fuzzy jocular nickname work


document multiple versions3
substance multiple names example index names versus iupac names4 generic drug names versus usan generic drug names versus brand names

inverse also possible multiple resources represented identifier discussed
implicit context namespace conflictsedit
also naming collision
many codes nomenclatural systems originate within small namespace years bleed larger namespaces people interact ways formerly hadnt crossborder trade scientific collaboration military alliance general cultural interconnection assimilation dissemination happens limitations original naming convention formerly latent moot become painfully apparent often necessitating retronymy synonymity translationtranscoding limitations generally accompany shift away original context broader typically system shows implicit context context formerly assumed narrow lack capacity number possible reflecting outmoded narrow context lack extensibility features defined reserved future needs lack specificity disambiguating capability related context shift longstanding uniqueness encounters novel nonuniqueness within computer science problem called naming collision story origination expansion coden system provides good case example recentdecades technicalnomenclature context capitalization variations seen specific designators reveals instance problem occurring natural languages proper nouncommon noun distinction complications must dealt universe every object would need namespaces would constitute gigantic namespace human minds could never keep track semantically interrelate many uids
