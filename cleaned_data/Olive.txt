black olives ripe olives picked full maturity fully ripe found assorted shades purple brown black73

traditional fermentation curingedit

fresh olives naturally bitter make palatable olives must cured fermented thereby removing oleuropein bitter phenolic compound reach levels matter young olives74 addition oleuropein phenolic compounds render freshly picked olives unpalatable must also removed lowered quantity curing fermentation generally speaking phenolics reach peak young fruit converted fruit matures75 ripening occurs levels phenolics sharply decline conversion organic products render cultivars edible immediately74 example edible olive native island thasos throubes black olive allowed ripen shrivel fall tree edible7677
curing process take days months brine salt packing78 exception california style saltcured olives methods curing involve major fermentation involving bacteria yeast equal importance final table olive product79 traditional cures using natural microflora fruit induce fermentation lead important outcomes leaching breakdown oleuropein unpalatable phenolic compounds generation favourable metabolites bacteria yeast organic acids probiotics glycerol esters affect sensory properties final table olives74 mixed bacterialyeast olive fermentations probiotic qualities8081 lactic acid important metabolite lowers acting natural preservative growth unwanted pathogenic species result table olives stored without refrigeration fermentations dominated lactic acid bacteria therefore suitable method curing olives yeastdominated fermentations produce different suite metabolites provide poorer preservation corrected acid citric acid final processing stage provide microbial stability19
