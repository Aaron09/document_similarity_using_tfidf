mechanism class switch recombination allows isotype switching activated cells


class switchingedit
isotype class switching biological process occurring activation cell allows cell produce different classes antibody igg8 different classes antibody thus effector functions defined constant regions immunoglobulin heavy chain initially naive cells express cellsurface identical antigen binding regions isotype adapted distinct function therefore activation antibody effector function might required effectively eliminate antigen class switching allows different daughter cells activated cell produce antibodies different isotypes constant region antibody heavy chain changes class switching variable regions therefore antigen specificity remain unchanged thus progeny single cell produce antibodies specific antigen ability produce effector function appropriate antigenic challenge class switching triggered cytokines isotype generated depends cytokines present cell environment44
class switching occurs heavy chain gene locus mechanism called class switch recombination mechanism relies conserved nucleotide motifs called switch regions found upstream constant region gene except δchain strand broken activity series enzymes selected sregions4546 variable domain exon rejoined process called nonhomologous joining nhej desired constant region process results immunoglobulin gene encodes antibody different isotype47
