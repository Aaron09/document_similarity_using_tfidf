order testudines includes extant living extinct species earliest known members group date million years ago1 making turtles oldest reptile groups ancient group snakes crocodilians known species alive today highly endangered67
turtles ectotherms—animals commonly called coldblooded—meaning internal temperature varies according ambient environment however high metabolic rate leatherback turtles body temperature noticeably higher surrounding water
turtles classified amniotes along reptiles birds mammals like amniotes turtles breathe eggs underwater although many species live around water

neck retraction


neck retraction turtles


pleurodires retract neck sideways



cryptodires retract neck backwards




turtles divided groups according retract necks shells something ancestral proganochelys could cryptodira retract necks backwards contracting spine whereas pleurodira contract necks side
head
turtles spend lives land eyes looking objects front aquatic turtles snapping turtles softshelled turtles eyes closer head species turtle hide predators shallow water entirely submerged except eyes nostrils near eyes turtles possess glands produce salty tears body excess salt taken water drink
turtles rigid beaks jaws chew food instead teeth appear lost 150200 million years ago20 upper lower jaws turtle covered horny ridges carnivorous turtles usually knifesharp ridges slicing prey herbivorous turtles serratededged ridges help tough plants tongues swallow food unlike reptiles cannot stick tongues catch food
shell
main article turtle shell
upper shell turtle called carapace lower shell encases belly called plastron carapace plastron joined together turtles sides bony structures called bridges inner layer turtles shell made bones include portions backbone ribs meaning turtle cannot crawl shell turtles outer layer shell covered horny scales called scutes part outer skin epidermis scutes made fibrous protein keratin also makes scales reptiles scutes overlap seams shell bones strength shell turtles horny scutes example leatherback turtle softshelled turtles shells covered leathery skin instead
rigid shell means turtles cannot breathe reptiles changing volume chest cavities expansion contraction ribs instead breathe ways first employ limb pumping sucking lungs pushing moving limbs relative shell secondly abdominal muscles cover posterior opening shell contract pressure inside shell lungs decreases drawing lungs allowing muscles function much mammalian diaphragm second abdominal muscles face opposite contract expel positive pressure21 shape shell gives helpful clues turtle lives tortoises large domeshaped shell makes difficult predators crush shell jaws exceptions african pancake tortoise flat flexible shell allows hide rock crevices aquatic turtles flat streamlined shells swimming diving american snapping turtles musk turtles small crossshaped plastrons give efficient movement walking along bottom ponds streams another exception belawan turtle cirebon west java sunkenback softshell
color turtles shell vary shells commonly colored brown black olive green species shells orange yellow grey markings often spots lines irregular blotches colorful turtles eastern painted turtle includes yellow plastron black olive shell markings around
tortoises landbased rather heavy shells contrast aquatic softshelled turtles lighter shells help avoid sinking water swim faster agility lighter shells large spaces called fontanelles shell bones shells leatherback turtles extremely light lack scutes contain many fontanelles
suggested jackson 2002 turtle shell function buffer endure anoxic conditions winter periods trapped beneath within anoxic bottom ponds turtles utilize general physiological mechanisms case prolonged periods anoxia shown turtle shell releases carbonate buffers uptakes lactic acid22
skin molting

limbs
terrestrial tortoises short sturdy feet tortoises famous moving slowly part heavy cumbersome shells restrict stride length




skeleton snapping turtle chelydra serpentina


amphibious turtles normally limbs similar tortoises except feet webbed often long claws turtles swim using four feet similar paddle feet left right side body alternately providing thrust large turtles tend swim less smaller ones species alligator snapping turtles hardly swim preferring walk along bottom river lake well webbed feet turtles long claws used help clamber onto riverbanks floating logs upon bask male turtles tend particularly long claws appear used stimulate female mating turtles webbed feet pignosed turtle true flippers digits fused paddles claws relatively small species swim turtles

behavior
senses

communication




arrau turtle sizable vocal repertoire24


typically thought mute turtles make various sounds communicating tortoises vocal courting mating various species freshwater turtles emit numerous types calls often short frequency time adults vocalizations serve create group cohesion migrating24
intelligence
