subduction geological process takes place convergent boundaries tectonic plates plate moves another forced sinks gravity mantle regions process occurs known subduction zones rates subduction typically centimeters year average rate convergence approximately eight centimeters year along plate boundaries1
plates include oceanic crust continental crust stable subduction zones involve oceanic lithosphere plate sliding beneath continental oceanic lithosphere another plate higher density oceanic lithosphere subducted lithosphere always oceanic overriding lithosphere oceanic subduction zones sites usually high rate volcanism earthquakes2 additionally subduction zones develop belts deformation3better source needed overriding plates crust processes called orogeny part leads mountain building

importanceedit
subduction zones important several reasonscitation needed

subduction zone physics sinking oceanic lithosphere sediments crust mantle contrast density cold lithosphere asthenospheric mantle wedge strongest force needed drive plate motion dominant mode mantle convection
subduction zone chemistry subducted sediments crust dehydrate release waterrich aqueous fluids overlying mantle causing mantle melting fractionation elements surface deep mantle reservoirs producing island arcs continental crust
subduction zones drag subducted oceanic sediments oceanic crust mantle lithosphere interact asthenospheric mantle overriding plate produce calcalkaline series melts deposits continental crust

subduction zones also considered possible disposal sites nuclear waste action subduction would carry material planetary mantle safely away possible influence humanity surface environment however method disposal currently banned international agreement28293031 furthermore plate subduction zones associated large megathrust earthquakes making effects using specific site disposal unpredictable possibly adverse safety longterm disposal29
