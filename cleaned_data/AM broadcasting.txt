person generally credited primary early developer technology canadianborn inventor reginald fessenden original sparkgap radio transmitters impractical transmitting audio since produced discontinuous pulses known damped waves fessenden realized needed type radio transmitter produced steady undamped better known continuous wave signals could modulated reflect sounds transmitted
fessendens basic approach disclosed patent 706737 applied 1901 issued next year called highspeed alternator referred alternatingcurrent dynamo generated pure sine waves produced continuous train radiant waves substantially uniform strength modern terminology continuouswave transmitter7 fessenden began research audio transmissions developmental work united states weather service cobb island maryland continuouswave transmitter initially worked experimental highfrequency spark transmitter taking advantage fact higher spark rate closer sparkgap transmission comes producing continuous waves later reported fall 1900 successfully transmitted speech distance kilometers mile8 appears first successful audio transmission using radio signals however time sound distorted commercially practical9 time continued working sophisticated highfrequency spark transmitters including versions used compressed began take characteristics arctransmitters10 fessenden attempted sell form radiotelephone pointtopoint communication unsuccessful11
alternator transmitteredit
fessendens work highfrequency spark transmissions temporary measure since ultimate plan creating audiocapable transmitter take basic electrical alternator normally rotated speeds produced alternating current hundred cyclespersecond greatly increase rotational speed order create electrical currents tensofthousands cyclespersecond thus producing steady continuouswave transmission connected aerial next step adopted standard wiretelephone practice insert simple carbon microphone transmission line order modulate carrier wave signal produce audio transmissions however would take many years expensive development even prototype alternatortransmitter would ready years beyond highpower versions become available12
fessenden worked general electrics ernst alexanderson august 1906 delivered improved model operated transmitting frequency approximately although power alternatortransmitter achieved goal transmitting quality audio signals lack amplify signals meant somewhat weak december 1906 fessenden made extensive demonstration alternatortransmitter brant rock massachusetts showing utility pointtopoint wireless telephony including interconnecting stations wire telephone network part demonstration speech transmitted kilometers miles listening site plymouth massachusetts13

amplify electrical currents time modulation usually accomplished carbon microphone inserted directly antenna wire meant full transmitter power flowed microphone even using water cooling power handling ability microphones severely limited power transmissions ultimately small number large powerful alexanderson alternators would developed however would almost exclusively used longrange radiotelegraph communication occasionally radiotelephone experimentation never used general broadcasting

vacuum tube transmittersedit
advances vacuum tube technology called valves british usage especially around 1915 revolutionized radio technology vacuum tubes devices could used amplify electrical currents overcame overheating issues needing insert microphones directly transmission antenna circuit vacuum tube transmitters also provided highquality signals could operate higher transmitting frequencies alternator transmitters17 nongovernmental radio transmissions prohibited many countries world radiotelephony technology advanced greatly wartime research availability tubes sparked great increase number amateur radio stations experimenting transmission news music vacuum tubes remained central technology radio years transistors began dominate 1960s still used highest power broadcast transmitters
