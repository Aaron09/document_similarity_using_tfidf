antibiotics given preventive measure prophylactic usually limited atrisk populations weakened immune system particularly cases prevent pneumonia taking immunosuppressive drugs cancer patients surgery15 surgical procedures help prevent infection incisions important role dental antibiotic prophylaxis prevent bacteremia consequent infective endocarditis antibiotics also used prevent infection cases neutropenia particularly cancerrelated1819
