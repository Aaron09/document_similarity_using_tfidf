superficial chemical burn caused sulfuric acid splashes forearm skin


sulfuric acid capable causing severe burns especially high concentrations common corrosive acids alkali readily decomposes proteins lipids amide ester hydrolysis upon contact living tissues skin flesh addition exhibits strong dehydrating property carbohydrates liberating extra heat causing secondary thermal burns56 accordingly rapidly attacks cornea induce permanent blindness splashed onto eyes ingested damages internal organs irreversibly even fatal4 protective equipment hence always used handling moreover strong oxidizing property makes highly corrosive many metals extend destruction materials5 reasons damage posed sulfuric acid potentially severe comparable strong acids hydrochloric acid nitric acid

sulfuric acid must stored carefully containers made nonreactive material glass solutions equal stronger labeled corrosive solutions greater less labeled irritant however even normal laboratory dilute grade approximately char paper left contact sufficient time
standard first treatment acid spills skin corrosive agents irrigation large quantities water washing continued least fifteen minutes cool tissue surrounding acid burn prevent secondary damage contaminated clothing removed immediately underlying skin washed thoroughly
dilution hazardsedit
preparation diluted acid dangerous heat released dilution process avoid splattering concentrated acid typically added water around water higher heat capacity acid vessel cold water absorb heat acid added
also acid denser water sinks bottom heat generated interface acid water bottom vessel acid boil higher boiling point warm water near interface rises convection cools interface prevents boiling either acid water
contrast addition water concentrated sulfuric acid results thin layer water acid heat generated thin layer water boil leading dispersal sulfuric acid aerosol worse explosion
preparation solutions greater concentration dangerous heat produced sufficient boil diluted acid efficient mechanical stirring external cooling bath essential
reaction rates double every degree celsius increase temperature31 therefore reaction become violent dilution proceeds unless mixture given time cool adding acid warm water cause violent reaction
laboratory scale sulfuric acid diluted pouring concentrated acid onto crushed made deionized water melts endothermic process dissolving acid amount heat needed melt process greater amount heat evolved dissolving acid solution remains cold melted dilution take place using water
