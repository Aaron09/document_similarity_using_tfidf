assignment speech sounds phonemesedit




simplified procedure determining whether sounds represent different phonemes


phoneme sound group different sounds perceived function speakers language dialect question example english phoneme occurs words scat skit although native speakers notice english dialects sounds words identical help·info kʰɪt sound aspirated skill help·info skɪl unaspirated words therefore contain different speech sounds phones transcribed aspirated form unaspirated different sounds nonetheless considered belong phoneme speaker used instead meaning word would change using aspirated form skill might sound word would still recognized contrast sounds would cause change meaning substituted example substitution sound would produce different word still sound must therefore considered represent different phoneme phoneme
shows english allophones single phoneme languages however perceived native speakers different sounds substituting change meaning word means languages sounds represent different phonemes example icelandic first sound kátur meaning cheerful first sound gátur meaning riddles icelandic therefore separate phonemes
minimal pairsedit
pair words like kátur gátur differ phone called minimal pair alternative phones question case existence minimal pairs common test decide whether phones represent different phonemes allophones phoneme take another example minimal pair illustrates english belong separate phonemes since words different meanings english speakers must conscious distinction sounds languages though including korean even though sounds occur minimal pair exists lack minimal pairs distinguishing korean provides evidence language allophones single phoneme word tata pronounced tada example hear word korean speakers perceive sound beginning middle word whereas english speaker would perceive different sounds locations signed languages american sign language also minimal pairs differing exactly signs parameters handshape movement location palm orientation nonmanual signal marker minimal pair exist signed language basic sign stays parameters changes1
however absence minimal pairs given pair phones always mean belong phoneme dissimilar phonetically likely speakers perceive sound example english minimal pair sounds bang fact shown complementary distribution could used argue allophones phoneme however dissimilar phonetically considered separate phonemes2
phonologists sometimes recourse near minimal pairs show speakers language perceive sounds significantly different even exact minimal pair exists lexicon virtually impossible find minimal pair distinguish english seems uncontroversial claim consonants distinct phonemes words pressure prɛʃər pleasure plɛʒər serve near minimal pair3
features phonemic statusedit
phonemes normally conceived abstractions discrete segmental speech sounds vowels consonants features pronunciation principally tone stress languages change meaning words phoneme contrasts consequently called phonemic features languages
phonemic stress encountered languages english example word invite stressed second syllable verb stressed first syllable without changing individual sounds becomes noun position stress word affects meaning therefore full phonemic specification providing enough detail enable word pronounced unambiguously would include indication position stress ɪnˈvaɪ̯t verb ˈɪnvaɪt noun languages french word stress cannot function position generally predictable therefore phonemic usually indicated dictionaries
phonemic tones found languages mandarin chinese given syllable five different tonal pronunciations

background related ideasedit
term phonème ancient greek φώνημα phōnēma sound made utterance thing spoken speech language4 reportedly first used dufrichedesgenettes 1873 referred speech sound term phoneme abstraction developed polish linguist niecisław baudouin courtenay student mikołaj kruszewski 1875–18955 term used fonema basic unit called psychophonetics daniel jones became first linguist western world term phoneme current sense employing word article phonetic structure sechuana language6 concept phoneme elaborated works nikolai trubetzkoy others prague school years 1926–1935 structuralists like ferdinand saussure edward sapir leonard bloomfield structuralists though sapir rejected idea cognitive psycholinguistic function phoneme78
later used redefined generative linguistics famously noam chomsky morris halle9 remains central many accounts development modern phonology theoretical concept model though supplemented even replaced others10
linguists roman jakobson morris halle proposed phonemes decomposable features features true minimal constituents language11 features overlap time suprasegmental phonemes oral language many phonemes sign languages features could characterized different ways jakobson colleagues defined acoustic terms12 chomsky halle used predominantly articulatory basis though retaining acoustic features ladefogeds system13 purely articulatory system apart acoustic term sibilant
description languages term chroneme used indicate contrastive length duration phonemes languages tones phonemic tone phonemes called tonemes though scholars working languages terms means obsolete
analogy phoneme linguists proposed sorts underlying objects giving names suffix morpheme grapheme sometimes called emic units latter term first used kenneth pike also generalized concepts emic etic description phonemic phonetic respectively applications outside linguistics14
restrictions occurrenceedit
main article phonotactics
languages generally allow words syllables built arbitrary sequences phonemes phonotactic restrictions sequences phonemes possible environments certain phonemes occur phonemes significantly limited restrictions called restricted phonemes
english examples restrictions include

sing occurs syllable never beginning many languages māori swahili tagalog thai appear wordinitially
occurs vowels beginning syllable never languages arabic romanian allow syllablefinally
nonrhotic dialects occur immediately vowel never consonant
occur vowel never syllable except interpretations word like analyzed

phonotactic restrictions alternatively analyzed cases neutralization neutralization archiphonemes particularly example occurrence three english nasals stops
biuniquenessedit
biuniqueness requirement classic structuralist phonemics means given phone wherever occurs must unambiguously assigned phoneme words mapping phones phonemes required manytoone rather manytomany notion biuniqueness controversial among pregenerative linguists prominently challenged morris halle noam chomsky late 1950s early 1960s
example problems arising biuniqueness requirement provided phenomenon flapping north american english cause either appropriate environments realized phone alveolar flap example flap sound heard words hitting bidding although clearly intended realize phoneme first word second appears contradict biuniqueness
discussion cases next section
neutralization archiphonemesedit
phonemes contrastive certain environments contrastive environments environments contrast contrast said neutralized positions become less clear phoneme given phone represents phonologists prefer specify unique phoneme cases since would mean providing redundant even arbitrary information instead technique underspecification archiphoneme object sometimes used represent underspecified phoneme
example neutralization provided russian vowels phonemes contrasting stressed syllables unstressed syllables contrast lost since reduced sound usually details vowel reduction russian order assign instance phonemes necessary consider morphological factors vowels occurs forms words inflectional pattern followed cases even provide unambiguous answer description using approach underspecification would attempt assign specific phoneme cases although might assigned archiphoneme written something like reflects neutralized phonemes position
somewhat different example found english three nasal phonemes wordfinal position contrast shown minimal triplet sung however stop provided morpheme boundary nasals possible given position limp lint link lɪmp lɪnt lɪŋk nasals therefore contrastive environments according theorists makes inappropriate assign nasal phones heard phonemes even though case phonetic evidence unambiguous instead analyze phones belonging single archiphoneme written something like state underlying representations limp lint link lɪnp lɪnt lɪnk
latter type analysis often associated nikolai trubetzkoy prague school archiphonemes often notated capital letter within pipes examples given ways second might notated include
another example english time involving complete phonetic convergence russian example flapping american english described biuniqueness words betting bedding might pronounced ˈbɛɾɪŋ speaker applies flapping consistently would necessary look morphological evidence pronunciation related forms example order determine phoneme flap represents previous examples theorists would prefer make determination simply assign flap cases single archiphoneme written example
special kind neutralization proposed generative phonology absolute neutralization

morphophoneme theoretical unit deeper level abstraction traditional phonemes taken unit morphemes built morphophoneme within morpheme expressed different ways different allomorphs morpheme according morphophonological rules example english plural morpheme appearing words cats dogs considered consist single morphophoneme might written example pronounced voiceless consonants cats cases dogs
numbers phonemes different languagesedit
given language small subset many possible sounds human speech organs produce allophony number distinct phonemes generally smaller number identifiably different sounds different languages vary considerably number phonemes systems although apparent variation sometimes result different approaches taken linguists analysis total phonemic inventory languages varies rotokas pirahã many xũ15
number phonemically distinct vowels ubykh arrernte extreme bantu language ngwe vowel qualities occur long short making oral vowels plus nasalized vowels long short making total vowels achieves pure vowels counting additional variation vowel length varying phonation regards consonant phonemes puinave papuan language tauade seven rotokas hand somewhere around ubykh english language uses rather large vowel phonemes including diphthongs although consonants close average
languages french phonemic tone stress cantonese several kam–sui languages nine tones languages wobe claimedby though disputedcitation needed
common vowel system consists five vowels common consonants relatively languages lack consonants although happen example arabic lacks standard hawaiian lacks mohawk tlingit lack hupa lacks simple colloquial samoan lacks rotokas quileute lack
