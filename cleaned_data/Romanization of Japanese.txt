following expulsion christians japan late 1590s early 17th century rōmaji fell used sporadically foreign texts mid19th century japan opened againcitation needed
mid19th century several systems developed culminating hepburn system named james curtis hepburn used third edition japanese–english dictionary published 1887 hepburn system included representation sounds since changed example lafcadio hearns book kwaidan shows older pronunciation modern hepburn romanization would written kaidan ghost talescitation needed
replacement japanese writing systemedit
meiji 1868–1912 japanese scholars advocated abolishing japanese writing system entirely using rōmaji instead nihonshiki romanization outgrowth movement several japanese texts published entirely rōmaji period failed catch later early 20th century scholars devised syllabary systems characters derived latin rather like cherokee syllabary even less popular since based historical latin script
today nihonshiki writing japanese advocated oomoto sect2 independent organizations3 allied occupation japan government supreme commander allied powers scap made official policy romanize japanese however policy failed moderate attempt japanese script reform followed

nonstandard romanizationedit
addition standardized systems many variations romanization used either simplification error confusion different systems deliberate stylistic reasons
notably various mappings japanese input methods convert keystrokes roman keyboard kana often combine features systems used plain text rather converted usually known wāpuro rōmaji wāpuro blend wādo purosessā word processor unlike standard systems wāpuro rōmaji requires characters outside ascii character
arguments favour variant romanizations specific contexts especially mixed leads confusion romanized japanese words indexed note confusion never occurs inputting japanese characters word processor input latin letters transliterated japanese kana soon processes character input
