sound propagate medium water solids longitudinal waves also transverse wave solids longitudinal transverse waves sound waves generated sound source vibrating diaphragm stereo speaker sound source creates vibrations surrounding medium source continues vibrate medium vibrations propagate away source speed sound thus forming sound wave fixed distance source pressure velocity displacement medium vary time instant time pressure velocity displacement vary space note particles medium travel sound wave intuitively obvious solid true liquids gases vibrations particles liquid transport vibrations average position particles time change propagation waves reflected refracted attenuated medium5
behavior sound propagation generally affected three things

complex relationship density pressure medium relationship affected temperature determines speed sound within medium
motion medium medium moving movement increase decrease absolute speed sound wave depending direction movement example sound moving wind speed propagation increased speed wind sound wind moving direction sound wind moving opposite directions speed sound wave decreased speed wind
viscosity medium medium viscosity determines rate sound attenuated many media water attenuation viscosity negligible
