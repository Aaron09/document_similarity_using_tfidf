advantages disadvantagesedit
regimental system generally admired esprit corps engenders units members efforts implement countries previouslyexisting continental system usually succeed system presents difficulties military planners must deal problems trying keep soldiers regiment together throughout careers administering separate garrisons training mess facilities regimental community serving retired members often makes difficult planners restructure forces moving merging repurposing units
armies continental system exists regimental system criticised parochial creating unnecessary rivalry different regiments question also raised whether healthy develop soldiers loyal regiment military general regiments recruited areas political ferment scotland wales ireland quebec india tend perform particularly well loyalty members exhibit regiments generally regimental system found function best countries smallto mediumsized military forces problems administering vast numbers personnel prevalent regimental system works particularly well environment prime role army consists smallscale police actions counterinsurgency operations requiring prolonged deployment away home situation coordination regiments rarely necessary esprit corps regiment provides emotional substitute sense public approval army receives home particularly relevant british experience days empire army virtually continuously engaged lowintensity conflict insurgents fullscale warfare exception rather rule
regimental system since decentralized regiments independent prevents army staging coup détat best exemplified british army since formation united kingdom military takeovers67
regimental system also foster close links regiment community recruited sense community ownership local regiments seen public outcry recent regimental amalgamations united kingdom hand recruitment single community lead concentrated potentially devastating local impact regiment takes heavy casualties
regimental system offers advantage grouping like units together centralized administrative training logistical purposes thereby creating economies scale effect ensuing increased efficiency
