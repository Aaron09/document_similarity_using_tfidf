educationedit




students observing demonstration laser physics institute


standard undergraduate physics curriculum consists classical mechanics electricity magnetism nonrelativistic quantum mechanics optics statistical mechanics thermodynamics8910 physics students also need training mathematics calculus differential equations linear algebra complex analysis computer science programming
physicsoriented career position requires least undergraduate degree physics applied physics career options widen masters degree like mphil mphys msci11
researchoriented careers students work toward specializing particular field fields specialization include experimental theoretical astrophysics atomic physics molecular physics biophysics chemical physics medical physics condensed matter physics cosmology geophysics gravitational physics material science microelectronics nuclear physics optics radiophysics electromagnetic field microwave particle physics plasma physics
honors awardsedit
highest honor awarded physicists nobel prize physics awarded since 1901 royal swedish academy sciencescitation needed national physics professional societies many prizes awards professional recognition case american physical society 2017 separate prizes separate awards field
careersedit
three major employers career physicists academic institutions laboratories private industries largest employer last physicists academia government labs tend titles assistants professors srjr scientist postdocs american institute physics physics phds holds jobs engineering development programs turn computer software businesseducation12 majority physicists employed apply skills training interdisciplinary sectors finance1314 titles graduate physicists include agricultural scientist traffic controller biophysicist computer programmer electrical engineer environmental analyst geophysicist medical physicist meteorologist oceanographer physics teacherprofessorresearcher physiognomist research scientist reactor physicist engineering physicist satellite missions analyst science writer stratigrapher software engineer systems engineer microelectronics engineer radar developer technical consultant etc15161718
physics programs typically deal metatheories laws regarding applied science hence undergraduate physicists take additional careers knowledge physics combined training disciplines computer science information technology patent laws engineering diplomas animation teaching industry selfemploymentcitation needed typical undergraduate physics program covers essential basic competence required areas physics endeavor like astrophysics laboratory knowledge electricity magnetism thermodynamics optics modern physics calculus also computer science programmingcitation needed hence majority physics bachelors degree holders employed private sector fields academia government military service nonprofit entities labs teaching19
typical duties physicists masters doctoral degrees working domain involves research observation analysis data preparation instrumentation design development industrial medical equipment computing software development etc20
professional certificationedit
united kingdomedit
chartered physicist cphys chartered status professional qualification awarded institute physics denoted postnominals cphys
achieving chartered status profession denotes wider community high level specialised subject knowledge professional competence according institute physics holders award chartered physicist cphys demonstrate highest standards professionalism uptodate expertise quality safety along capacity undertake independent practice exercise leadership well commitment keep pace advancing knowledge increasing expectations requirements profession must take responsibility
chartered physicist considered equal status chartered engineer also awards member engineering council chartered statuses also considered regulated profession european professional qualification directives
canadaedit
canadian association physicists appoint official designation called phys stands professional physicist similar designation stands professional engineer designation unveiled congress 1999 already people carry distinction
certification minimum proof honours bachelor higher degree physics closely related discipline must provided also physicist must completed complete three years recent physicsrelated work experience graduation unless exempted professional practice examination must also passed exemption granted candidate practiced physics least seven years provide detailed description professional accomplishments clearly demonstrate exam necessary
work experience considered physicsrelated uses physics directly significantly utilizes modes thought approach problemsolving developed education andor experience physicist cases regardless whether experience academia industry government elsewhere management physics related work qualifies appropriate graduate student work
south africaedit
