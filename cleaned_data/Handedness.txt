righthandedness common righthanded people skillful right hands performing tasks studies suggest 70–95 world population righthanded5
lefthandedness less common righthandedness lefthanded people skillful left hands performing tasks studies suggest approximately world population lefthanded6
crossdominance mixedhandedness change hand preference tasks uncommon population prevalence7
ambidexterity exceptionally rare although learned truly ambidextrous person able task equally well either hand learn still tend favor originally dominant hand1

handedness developmental timelineedit
infants known fluctuate heavily choosing hand lead grasping object manipulation tasks especially shown observing hand dominance versus twohanded grasping tasks months variability handedness handed grasping begins decline significantly difference seen earlier bimanual manipulation tasks 1836 month children showed hand preference performing bimanipulation tasks simple grasping8 decrease handedness variability 3648 month children could likely attributed preschool kindergarten attendance increase required single hand grasping activities writing coloring force children develop hand preference8
developmental theories handednessedit
several theories handedness develops individual humans occurrences prenatal development important researchers studied fetuses utero determined handedness womb accurate predictor handedness birth9 2013 study infants months toddlers months demonstrated hand preference10
division laboredit
common theory handedness affects hemispheres brain hemisphere division labor since speaking handiwork require fine motor skills presumption would efficient brain hemisphere rather divided since people left side brain controls speaking righthandedness predominates theory also predicts lefthanded people reversed brain division labor11
verbal processing righthanded individuals takes place mostly left hemisphere whereas visuospatial processing mostly done opposite hemisphere lefthanded individuals heterogeneous brain organization brain hemisphere either organized righthanders hemispheres reversed even hemispheres used verbal processing average taken across types lefthandedness shows lefthanders less lateralized11
genetic factorsedit
handedness displays complex inheritance pattern example parents child lefthanded chance child lefthanded12 large study twins 25732 families medland 2006 indicated heritability handedness roughly 2413
date theoretical single gene models proposed explain patterns inheritance handedness first marian annett14 university leicester second professor chris mcmanus12
however growing weight evidence linkage genomewide association studies suggests genetic variance handedness cannot explained single genetic locus1516171819202122 studies mcmanus conclude handedness polygenic estimate least loci contribute determining trait23
brandler performed genomewide association study measure relative hand skill found genes involved determination leftright asymmetry body play role determining handedness24 results suggest mechanisms determine leftright asymmetry body nodal signaling ciliogenesis also play role development brain asymmetry handedness outward reflection brain asymmetry motor function
epigenetic factorsedit
twin studies indicate genetic factors explain variance handedness environmental factors explain remaining 7525 molecular basis handedness epigenetics largely unclear ocklenburg 2017 found asymmetric methylation sites plays role gene expression asymmetries related handedness2627
prenatal hormone exposureedit
four studies indicated individuals inutero exposure diethylstilbestrol synthetic estrogenbased fertility drug likely lefthanded clinical control group diethylstilbestrol animal studies suggest estrogen affects developing brain including part governs sexual behavior right left dominance28293031
prenatal vestibular asymmetryedit
previc reviewing large number studies found evidence position fetus final trimester babys subsequent birth position affect handedness twothirds fetuses present left occiput back head birth partly explains prematurity results decrease righthandedness previc argues asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation vestibular system involved development handedness fact every major disorder patients show reduced righthandedness associated either vestibular abnormalities delay32 asymmetry vestibular cortex strongly correlated direction handedness33
ultrasoundedit
another theory ultrasound affect brains unborn children causing higher rates lefthandedness children whose mothers received ultrasounds pregnancy research topic suggests exist weak association ultrasound screening sonography used check healthy development fetus mother pregnancy lefthandedness34

writing scientific american mcmanus states

studies australia revealed lefthanded people differ righthanders point noteworthy lefthanders’ brains structured differently righthanders’ ways allow process language spatial relations emotions diverse potentially creative ways also slightly larger number lefthanders righthanders especially gifted music math study musicians professional orchestras found significantly greater proportion talented lefthanders even among played instruments seem designed righthanders violins similarly studies adolescents took tests assess mathematical giftedness found many lefthanders population36

conversely joshua goodman found evidence lefthanders overrepresented amongst high cognitive spectrum weak methodological sampling issues conducted studies goodman also found lefthanders overrepresented cognitive spectrum mentally disabled twice likely lefthanded compared general population well generally lower cognitive noncognitive abilities amongst lefthanded children37
early childhood intelligenceedit
nelson campbell michel studied infants whether developing handedness infancy correlated language abilities toddlers article assessed infants followed months became toddlers 18–24 months discovered child developed consistent right left hand infancy using right hand pacifier back grasping random objects left hand likely superior language skills toddler children became lateral later infancy toddlers showed normal development language typical language scores38 researchers used bayley scales infant toddler development assess subjects

2006 study researchers lafayette college johns hopkins university concluded statistically significant correlation handedness earnings general population among collegeeducated people lefthanders earned righthanded counterparts50
