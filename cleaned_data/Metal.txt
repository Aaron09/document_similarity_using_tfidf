closepacking spheres


atoms metallic substances typically arranged three common crystal structures namely bodycentered cubic facecentered cubic hexagonal closepacked atom positioned center cube eight others atom surrounded twelve others stacking layers differs metals adopt different structures depending temperature5
atoms metals readily lose outer shell electrons resulting free flowing cloud electrons within otherwise solid arrangement provides ability metallic substances easily transmit heat electricity flow electrons occurs solid characteristic metal produced electrostatic interactions atom electron cloud type bond called metallic bond6
