urinary system also known renal system consists kidneys ureters bladder urethra kidney consists millions functional units called nephrons purpose renal system eliminate wastes body regulate blood volume blood pressure control levels electrolytes metabolites regulate blood kidneys extensive blood supply renal arteries leave kidneys renal vein following filtration blood processing wastes form urine exit kidney ureters tubes made smooth muscle fibers propel urine towards urinary bladder stored subsequently expelled body urination voiding female male urinary system similar differing length urethra1
urine formed kidneys filtration blood urine passed ureters bladder stored urination urine passed bladder urethra outside body
800–2000 milliliters urine normally produced every healthy human amount varies according fluid intake kidney function

structureedit
urinary system refers structures produce conduct urine point excretion human body normally paired kidneys left right urine formed nephrons functional unit kidney flows system converging tubules called collecting ducts collecting ducts join together form minor calyces major calyces ultimately join pelvis kidney renal pelvis urine flows renal pelvis ureter tubelike structure carries urine kidneys bladder
urination urine stored bladder discharged urethra males urethra begins internal urethral orifice trigone bladder continues external urethral orifice becomes prostatic membranous bulbar penile urethra urine exits external urethral meatus female urethra much shorter beginning bladder neck terminating vaginal vestibule
developmentedit
main article development urinary system
microanatomyedit
also urothelium
microscopy urinary system covered unique lining called urothelium type transitional epithelium unlike epithelial lining organs transitional epithelium flatten distend urothelium covers urinary system including renal pelvis ureters bladder
functionedit
several functions urinary system

removal waste product body mainly urea uric acid
regulation electrolyte balance sodium potassium calcium
regulation acidbase homeostasis
controlling blood volume maintaining blood pressure

urine formationedit
average urine production adult humans litres depending state hydration activity level environmental factors weight individuals health producing much little urine requires medical attention polyuria condition excessive urine production lday oliguria millilitres produced anuria
first step urine formation filtration blood kidneys healthy human kidney receives cardiac output averages lmin
basic structural functional unit kidney nephron chief function regulate concentration water soluble substances like sodium filtering blood reabsorbing needed excreting rest urine
first part nephron bowmans capsule filters blood circulatory system tubules hydrostatic osmotic pressure gradients facilitate filtration across semipermeable membrane filtrate includes water small molecules ions easily pass filtration membrane however larger molecules proteins blood cells prevented passing filtration membrane amount filtrate produced every minute called glomerular filtration rate amounts litres filtrate reabsorbed passes nephron remaining becomes urine
urinary system regulated endocrine system hormones antidiuretic hormone aldosterone parathyroid hormone2
regulation concentration volumeedit
urinary system influence circulatory system nervous system endocrine system
aldosterone plays central role regulating blood pressure effects kidney acts distal tubules collecting ducts nephron increases reabsorption sodium glomerular filtrate reabsorption sodium results retention water increases blood pressure blood volume antidiuretic hormone neurohypophysial hormone found mammals primary functions retain water body constrict blood vessels vasopressin regulates bodys retention water increasing water reabsorption collecting ducts kidney nephron3 vasopressin increases water permeability kidneys collecting duct distal convoluted tubule inducing translocation aquaporincd water channels kidney nephron collecting duct plasma membrane4
urinationedit
main article urination
urination ejection urine urinary bladder urethra outside body healthy humans many animals process urination voluntary control infants elderly individuals neurological injury urination occur involuntary reflex physiologically micturition involves coordination central autonomic somatic nervous systems brain centers regulate urination include pontine micturition center periaqueductal gray cerebral cortex placental mammals male ejects urine penis female vulva
clinical significanceedit
main article urologic disease
urologic disease involve congenital acquired dysfunction urinary system
diseases kidney tissue normally treated nephrologists disease urinary tract treated urologists gynecologists also treat female urinary incontinence
diseases bodily systems also direct effect urogenital function instance shown protein released kidneys diabetes mellitus sensitises kidney damaging effects hypertension5
diabetes also direct effect urination peripheral neuropathies occur individuals poorly controlled diabetes6
urinary incontinence result weakening pelvic floor muscles caused factors pregnancy childbirth aging overweight pelvic floor exercises known kegel exercises help condition strengthening pelvic floor also underlying medical reasons urinary incontinence often treatable children condition called enuresis
