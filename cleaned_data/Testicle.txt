structure
appearance




male gonads testes left female ovaries right


males testicles similar size contained within scrotum extension abdominal wall scrotal asymmetry unusual testicle extends scrotum differences anatomy vasculature
measurement
volume testicle estimated palpating comparing ellipsoids known sizes another method calipers orchidometer ruler either person ultrasound image obtain three measurements axes length depth width measurements used calculate volume using formula volume ellipsoid length2 width2 depth2
dimensions average adult testicle inches long inches breadth inches height tanner scale maturity male genitals assigns maturity stage calculated volume ranging stage volume less stage volume greater normal volume average testis range cm³1
evidence suggest average human testicle size weight progressively diminishing recent years among younger cohorts western industrialized nations associated decline sperm counts
internal structure




transverse section left side scrotum left testis


duct system
testes covered tough membranous shell called tunica albuginea within testes fine coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules tubules lined layer cells germ cells develop puberty sperm cells also known spermatozoa male gametes developing sperm travel seminiferous tubules rete testis located mediastinum testis efferent ducts epididymis newly created sperm cells mature spermatogenesis sperm move deferens eventually expelled urethra urethral orifice muscular contractions
primary cell types

within seminiferous tubules


germ cells develop spermatogonia spermatocytes spermatids spermatozoon process spermatogenesis gametes contain fertilization ovum2
sertoli cells true epithelium seminiferous epithelium critical support germ cell development spermatozoa sertoli cells secrete inhibin3
peritubular myoid cells surround seminiferous tubules4


tubules interstitial cells


leydig cells cells localized seminiferous tubules produce secrete testosterone androgens important sexual development puberty secondary sexual characteristics like facial hair sexual behavior libido supporting spermatogenesis erectile function testosterone also controls testicular volume

blood supply lymphatic drainage
blood supply lymphatic drainage testes scrotum distinct

paired testicular arteries arise directly abdominal aorta descend inguinal canal scrotum rest external genitalia supplied internal pudendal artery branch internal iliac artery
testis collateral blood supply cremasteric artery branch inferior epigastric artery branch external iliac artery artery ductus deferens branch inferior vesical artery branch internal iliac artery therefore testicular artery ligated fowlerstevens orchiopexy high undescended testis testis usually survive blood supplies
lymphatic drainage testes follows testicular arteries back paraaortic lymph nodes lymph scrotum drains inguinal lymph nodes

layers
many anatomical features adult testis reflect developmental origin abdomen layers tissue enclosing testicle derived layers anterior abdominal wall notably cremasteric muscle arises internal oblique muscle
blood–testis barrier
large molecules cannot pass blood lumen seminiferous tubule presence tight junctions adjacent sertoli cells spermatogonia basal compartment deep level tight junctions mature forms primary secondary spermatocytes spermatids adluminal compartment
function blood–testis barrier highlight diagram prevent autoimmune reaction mature sperm antigens arise long immune tolerance established infancy therefore since sperm antigenically different self tissue male animal react immunologically sperm fact capable making antibodies
injection sperm antigens causes inflammation testis autoimmune orchitis reduced fertility thus blood–testis barrier reduce likelihood sperm proteins induce immune response reducing fertility progeny
temperature regulation
spermatogenesis enhanced temperatures slightly less core body temperature5 spermatogenesis less efficient lower higher temperatures testes located outside body smooth tissue scrotum move closer away body5 temperature testes maintained degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit degrees body temperature degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit higher temperatures affect spermatogenesis6 number mechanisms maintain testes optimum temperature5
cremasteric muscle part spermatic cord muscle contracts cord shortened testicle moved closer toward body provides slightly warmth maintain optimal testicular temperature cooling required cremasteric muscle relaxes testicle lowered away warm body able cool contraction also occurs response stress testicles rise toward body effort protect fight persistent reports relaxation indicates approach orgasmcitation needed noticeable tendency also retract orgasmcitation needed
cremaster muscle reflexively raise testicle individually properly triggered phenomenon known cremasteric reflex testicles also lifted voluntarily using pubococcygeus muscle partially activates related muscles
gene protein expression
information bioinformatics gene protein expression
human genome includes approximately 20000 protein coding genes genes expressed adult testes7 testes highest fraction tissue typespecific genes compared organs tissues8 1000 highly specific testes7 2200 show elevated pattern expression majority genes encode proteins expressed seminiferous tubules functions related spermatogenesis98 sperm cells express proteins result development flagella proteins expressed female cells lining fallopian tube cause development cilia words sperm cell flagella fallopian tube cilia homologous structures testisspecific proteins show highest level expression protamines
development
phases testes grow substantially namely embryonic pubertal
embryonic
mammalian development gonads first capable becoming either ovaries testes10 humans starting week gonadal rudiments present within intermediate mesoderm adjacent developing kidneys week cords develop within forming testes made early sertoli cells surround nurture germ cells migrate gonads shortly determination begins males sexspecific gene found ychromosome initiates determination downstream regulation sexdetermining factors gata4 sox9 leads development male phenotype including directing development early bipotential gonad male path development
testes follow path descent high posterior fetal abdomen inguinal ring beyond inguinal canal scrotum cases fullterm preterm testes descended birth cases testis fails descend cryptorchidism probably express within year
pubertal
testes grow response start spermatogenesis size depends lytic function sperm production amount spermatogenesis present testis interstitial fluid sertoli cell fluid production puberty volume testes increased compared prepubertal sizecitation needed testicles fully descended reaches puberty
clinical significance

protection injury
information testicular pain

testicles wellknown sensitive impact injury pain involved travels testicle abdominal cavity spermatic plexus primary nerve testicle cause pain back pain usually goes away minutes
testicular torsion medical emergency
testicular rupture medical emergency caused blunt force impact sharp edge piercing impact testicles lead necrosis testis little minutescitation needed
penetrating injuries scrotum cause castration physical separation destruction testes possibly along part penis results total sterility testicles reattached quickly

boreoeutherian land mammals large group mammals includes humans externalized testes32 testes function best temperatures lower core body temperature testes located outside body suspended spermatic cord within scrotum
several hypotheses boreotherian mammals external testes operate best temperature slightly less core body temperature stuck enzymes evolved colder temperature external testes evolving different reasons lower temperature testes simply efficient sperm production
efficient classic hypothesis cooler temperature testes allows efficient fertile spermatogenesis words possible enzymes operating normal core body temperature efficient ones evolved least none appearing evolution
early mammals lower body temperatures thus testes worked efficiently within body however argued boreotherian mammals higher body temperatures mammals develop external testes keep cool argued mammals internal testes monotremes armadillos sloths elephants rhinoceroses lower core body temperatures mammals external testescitation needed
however question remains birds despite high core body temperatures internal testes evolve external testes33 theorized birds used sacs cool testes internally later studies revealed birds testes able function core body temperature33
mammals seasonal breeding cycles keep testes internal breeding season point testes descend increase size become external34
irreversible adaptation sperm competition suggested ancestor boreoeutherian mammals small mammal required large testes perhaps rather like hamster sperm competition thus place testes outside body35 enzymes involved spermatogenesis spermatogenic polymerase beta recombinase activities evolving unique temperature optimum slightly less core body temperature boreoeutherian mammals diversified forms larger andor require intense sperm competition still produced enzymes operated best cooler temperatures keep testes outside body position made less parsimonious fact kangaroo nonboreoeutherian mammal external testicles ancestors kangaroos might separately boreotherian mammals also subject heavy sperm competition thus developed external testes however kangaroo external testes suggestive possible adaptive function external testes large animals
protection abdominal cavity pressure changes argument evolution external testes protects testes abdominal cavity pressure changes caused jumping galloping36
