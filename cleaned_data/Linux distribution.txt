timeline representing development various linux distributions including android 201611


linus torvalds developed linux kernel distributed first version 1991 linux initially distributed source code later pair downloadable floppy disk images bootable containing linux kernel utilities tools setting file system since installation procedure complicated especially face growing amounts available software distributions sprang simplify this12
early distributions included following

bootroot aforementioned disk image pair kernel absolute minimal tools started
interim linux made available public download february 1992
softlanding linux system released 1992 comprehensive distribution short time including window system
yggdrasil linuxgnux commercial distribution first released december 1992

oldest still active distribution projects started 1993 distribution well maintained july 1993 distribution called slackware based released patrick volkerding13 also dissatisfied murdock create free distribution founding debian first release december 199314
users attracted linux distributions alternatives microsoft windows operating systems compatible computers apple macintosh proprietary versions unix early adopters familiar unix work school embraced linux distributions cost availability source code software included
originally distributions simply convenience offering free alternative proprietary versions unix later became usual choice even unix linux expertscitation needed
date linux become popular server embedded devices markets desktop market example linux used servers15 whereas desktop market share 3716

linux distribution usually built around package management system puts together linux kernel free opensource software occasionally proprietary software


many linux distributions provide installation system akin provided modern operating systems hand distributions including gentoo linux provide binaries basic kernel compilation tools installer installer compiles requested software specific architecture users computer using tools provided source code
package managementedit
also package management system linux package formats
distributions normally segmented packages package contains specific application service examples packages library handling image format collection fonts browser
package typically provided compiled code installation removal packages handled package management system rather simple file archiver package intended contains metainformation package description version dependencies package management system evaluate metainformation allow package searches perform automatic upgrade newer version check dependencies package fulfilled andor fulfill automatically
although linux distributions typically contain much software proprietary operating systems normal local administrators also install software included distribution example would newer version software application supplied distribution alternative chosen distribution example plasma workspaces rather gnome vice versa user interface layer additional software distributed sourceonly form approach requires local compilation however additional software locally added state local system fall synchronization state package managers database local administrator required take additional measures ensure entire system kept date package manager longer able automatically
distributions install packages including kernel core operating system components predetermined configuration require even permit configuration adjustments first install time makes installation less daunting particularly users always acceptable specific requirements much software must carefully configured useful work correctly software secure local administrators often obliged spend time reviewing reconfiguring assorted software
distributions considerable lengths specifically adjust customize software included distribution distributions provide configuration tools assist process
replacing everything provided distribution administrator reach distributionless state everything retrieved compiled configured installed locally possible build system scratch avoiding distribution altogether needs generate first binaries system selfhosting done compilation another system capable building binaries intended target possibly crosscompilation example linux scratch

interdistribution issuesedit
free standards group organization formed major software hardware vendors aims improve interoperability different distributions among proposed standards linux standard base defines common packaging system linux filesystem hierarchy standard recommends standard filenaming chart notably basic directory names found root tree linux filesystem standards however limited even among distributions developed members organizationcitation needed
diversity linux distributions means software runs distributions depending libraries system attributes required packaged software software repositories usually specific particular distribution though crossinstallation sometimes possible closely related distributionscitation needed
tools choosing distributionedit
process constantly switching distributions often referred distro hopping28 virtual machines virtualbox vmware workstation virtualize hardware allowing users test live media virtual machine websites like distrowatch offer lists popular distributions link screenshots operating systems first impression various distributions
tools available help people select appropriate distribution several versions linux distribution chooser29 universal package search tool whohas30 easy ways several linux distributions deciding multi distro live contains nine spacesaving distributions31
installationedit
many ways install linux distribution common method installing linux booting optical disc contains installation program installable software disk burned downloaded image purchased alone price provided cover disk magazine shipped free request obtained part also include manuals additional commercial software
early linux distributions installed using sets floppies abandoned major distributions nowadays distributions offer sets vital packages first disc less important packages later ones usually also allow installation network booting either floppies small amount data it32
users tend begin partitioning hard drive order keep previously installed operating system linux distribution installed separate partition without affecting previously saved data
live setup computer boots entire operating system without first installing computers hard disk distributions live installer computer boots operating system disk proceeds install onto computers hard disk providing seamless transition running running hard disk
servers personal computers come linux already installed available vendors including hewlettpackard dell system76
embedded devices linux typically held devices firmware consumeraccessible
anaconda popular installers used enterprise linux fedora uses fedora media writer distributions simplify installation process debian ubuntu many others debianinstaller
installation existing operating systemedit
distributions user install linux current system winlinux colinux linux installed windows hard disk partition started inside windows
virtual machines virtualbox vmware also make possible linux inside another software simulates separate computer onto linux system installed installation virtual machine booted independent computer
various tools also available perform full dualboot installations existing platforms without notably

deprecated wubi installer allows windows users download install ubuntu derivatives fat32 ntfs partition without installation allowing users easily dual boot either operating system hard drive without losing data replaced ubiquity
win32loader process integrated official debian cdsdvds allows windows users install debian without though performs network installation thereby requires repartitioning33
unetbootin allows windows linux users perform similar nocd network installations wide variety linux distributions additionally provides live creation support
