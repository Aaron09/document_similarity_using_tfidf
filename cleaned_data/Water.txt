water liquid temperatures pressures adequate life specifically standard pressure water liquid increasing pressure slightly lowers melting point 2100 effect relevant example skating buried lakes antarctica movement glaciers pressures higher 2100 melting point rapidly increases takes several exotic forms exist lower pressures
increasing pressure dramatic effect boiling point effect important among things deepsea hydrothermal vents geysers pressure cooking steam engine design mount everest atmospheric pressure water boils
pressures 0006 water cannot exist liquid state passes directly solid sublimation—a phenomenon exploited freeze drying food high pressures liquid states longer distinguishable state called supercritical steam
water also differs liquids becomes less dense freezes maximum density water liquid form 1000 kgm3 6243 lbcu occurs 3916 °f14 density kgm3 5725 lbcu ft1516 thus water expands volume freezes accounts fact floats liquid water
