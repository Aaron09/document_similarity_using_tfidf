main article nuclear structure
although standard model physics widely believed completely describe composition behavior nucleus generating predictions theory much difficult areas particle physics reasons

principle physics within nucleus derived entirely quantum chromodynamics practice however current computational mathematical approaches solving lowenergy systems nuclei extremely limited phase transition occurs highenergy quark matter lowenergy hadronic matter renders perturbative techniques unusable making difficult construct accurate qcdderived model forces nucleons current approaches limited either phenomenological models argonne potential chiral effective field theory16
even nuclear force well constrained significant amount computational power required accurately compute properties nuclei initio developments manybody theory made possible many mass relatively stable nuclei improvements computational power mathematical approaches required heavy nuclei highly unstable nuclei tackled

historically experiments compared relatively crude models necessarily imperfect none models completely explain experimental data nuclear structure17
nuclear radius considered basic quantities model must predict stable nuclei halo nuclei unstable distorted nuclei nuclear radius roughly proportional cube root mass number nucleus particularly nuclei containing many nucleons arrange spherical configurations
