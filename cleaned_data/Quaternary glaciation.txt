main article origin theory
quaternary glaciation first demonstrated occurred field geology thus proving ages possible done 1700s 1800s part scientific revolution
last century extensive field observations provided evidence continental glaciers covered large parts europe north america siberia maps glacial features compiled many years fieldwork hundreds geologists mapped location orientation drumlins eskers moraines striations glacial stream channels order reveal extent sheets direction flow locations systems meltwater channels also allowed scientists decipher history multiple advances retreats even theory worldwide glaciation generally accepted many observers recognized single advance retreat occurred

plate tectonics ocean currentsedit
information plate tectonics ocean current
important component longterm temperature drop related positions continents relative poles cannot explain rapid retreat advances glaciers11 relation control circulation oceans atmosphere affecting ocean currents carry heat high latitude throughout geologic time north pole appears broad open ocean allowed major ocean currents move unabated equatorial waters flowed polar regions warming water temperate latitudes unrestricted circulation produced mild uniform climates persisted throughout geologic time
throughout cenozoic large north american south american continental plates moved westward eurasian plate drift interlocked development atlantic ocean trending northsouth north pole small nearly landlocked basin arctic ocean isthmus panama developed convergent plate margin million years separated oceanic circulation closing last strait outside polar regions connected pacific atlantic oceans12
effectsedit
presence much upon continents profound effect upon almost every aspect earths hydrologic system obvious effects spectacular mountain scenery continental landscapes fashioned glacial erosion deposition instead running water entirely landscapes covering millions square kilometers formed relatively short period geologic time addition vast bodies glacial affected earth well beyond glacier margins directly indirectly effects glaciation felt every part world
lakesedit
information glacial lake
quaternary glaciation created lakes geologic processes combined reason continental glacier completely disrupts preglacial drainage system surface glacier moved scoured eroded leaving myriad closed undrained depressions bedrock depressions filled water became lakes
large lakes created along glacial margins north america europe 3000 9800 thick near centers maximum accumulation tapered toward glacier margins weight caused crustal subsidence greatest beneath thickest accumulation melted rebound crust lagged behind producing regional slope toward slope formed basins lasted thousands years basins became lakes invaded ocean great lakes13 baltic northern europe1415 formed primarily
numerous lakes canadian shield sweden finland thought originated least partly glaciers selective erosion weathered bedrock1617
pluvial lakesedit
main article pluvial lake
climatic conditions cause glaciation indirect effect arid semiarid regions removed large sheets increased precipitation glaciers also increased runoff major rivers intermittent streams resulting growth development large pluvial lakes pluvial lakes developed relatively arid regions typically insufficient rain establish drainage system instead stream runoff areas flowed closed basins formed playa lakes increased rainfall playa lakes enlarged overflowed pluvial lakes extensive glacial periods interglacial stages less precipitation fell pluvial lakes shrank form small salt flats
isostatic adjustmentedit
main article postglacial rebound
major isostatic adjustments lithosphere quaternary glaciation caused weight depressed continents canada large area around hudson depressed level area europe around baltic land rebounding depressions since melted isostatic movements triggered large earthquakes scandinavia 9000 years earthquakes unique associated plate tectonics
studies shown uplift taken place distinct stages initial uplift following deglaciation rapid called elastic took place unloaded elastic phase uplift proceed slow viscous flow rate decreased exponentially today typical uplift rates order year less northern europe clearly shown data obtained bifrost network18 studies suggest rebound continue least another 10000 years total uplift deglaciation depends local load could several hundred meters near center rebound
windsedit
presence much continents greatly modified patterns atmospheric circulation winds near glacial margins strong persistent abundance dense cold coming glacier fields winds picked transported large quantities loose finegrained sediment brought glaciers dust accumulated loess windblown silt forming irregular blankets much missouri river valley central europe northern china
sand dunes much widespread active many areas early quaternary period good example sand hills region nebraska covers area 60000 23166 mi19 region large active dune field pleistocene epoch today largely stabilized grass cover2021
ocean currentsedit
thick glaciers heavy enough reach bottom several important areas thus blocking passage ocean water thereby affecting ocean currents addition direct effects caused feedback effects ocean currents contribute global heat transfer

popular culture often reference next age26 technically earth already present albeit interglacial period usually refers next glacial period
1970s paleoclimatologists concerned possibility global cooling suggested next glacial period could rapidly approaching previous interglacial periods seemed lasted 10000 years report 1972 assuming present interglacial period would equally long concluded likely presentday warm epoch terminate relatively soon intervene27 since understanding climate system improved known interglacial periods length solar heating varies nonlinear fashion forced milankovitch orbital cycles causes section time also known greenhouse gases increasing concentration passing year based variations solar heating amount
