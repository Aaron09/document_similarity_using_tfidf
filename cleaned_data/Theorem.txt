informal account theoremsedit
logically many theorems form indicative conditional theorem assert necessary consequence case called hypothesis theorem hypothesis something different conjecture conclusion formally termed antecedent consequent theorem even natural number natural number typical example hypothesis even natural number conclusion also natural number
proved theorem must expressible precise formal statement nevertheless theorems usually expressed natural language rather completely symbolic form intention reader produce formal statement informal
common mathematics choose number hypotheses within given language declare theory consists statements provable hypotheses hypotheses form foundational basis theory called axioms postulates field mathematics known proof theory studies formal languages axioms structure proofs


planar five colors regions color meet actually colored four colors four color theorem states colorings possible planar every known proof involves computational search long check hand


theorems trivial sense follow definitions axioms theorems obvious ways contain surprising insights hand called deep proofs long difficult involve areas mathematics superficially distinct statement theorem show surprising connections disparate areas mathematics3 theorem might simple state deep excellent example fermats last theorem many examples simple deep theorems number theory combinatorics among areas
theorems known proof cannot easily written prominent examples four color theorem kepler conjecture theorems known true reducing computational search verified computer program initially many mathematicians accept form proof become widely accepted mathematician doron zeilberger even gone claim possibly nontrivial results mathematicians ever proved4 many mathematical theorems reduced straightforward computation including polynomial identities trigonometric identities hypergeometric identities5page needed

collatz conjecture illustrate complexity extend iteration natural numbers complex numbers result fractal accordance universality resembles mandelbrot


nonetheless degree empiricism data collection involved discovery mathematical theorems establishing pattern sometimes powerful computer mathematicians idea prove cases even plan proof example collatz conjecture verified start values 1018 riemann hypothesis verified first trillion zeroes zeta function neither statements considered proved

number different terms mathematical statements exist terms indicate role statements play particular subject distinction different terms sometimes rather arbitrary usage terms evolved time

axiom postulate statement accepted without proof regarded fundamental subject historically regarded selfevident recently considered assumptions characterize subject study classical geometry axioms general statements postulates statements geometrical objects6 definition also accepted without proof since simply gives meaning word phrase terms known concepts


unproved statement believed true called conjecture sometimes hypothesis different meaning discussed considered conjecture statement must usually proposed publicly point name proponent attached conjecture goldbachs conjecture famous conjectures include collatz conjecture riemann hypothesis hand fermats last theorem always known name even proved never known fermats conjecture
proposition theorem lesser importance term sometimes connotes statement simple proof term theorem usually reserved important results long difficult proofs authors never proposition others theorem fundamental results classical geometry term used differently euclids elements theorems geometric constructions called propositions regardless importance
lemma helping theorem proposition little applicability except forms part proof larger theorem cases relative importance different theorems becomes clear considered lemma considered theorem though word lemma remains name examples include gausss lemma zorns lemma fundamental lemma
corollary proposition follows little proof another theorem definition7 also corollary theorem restated restricted special case example theorem angles rectangle right angles corollary angles square special case rectangle right angles
converse theorem statement formed interchanging given theorem proved example isosceles triangle theorem states sides triangle equal angles equal converse given sides equal proved angles equal swapped converse statement angles triangle equal sides equal example converse proved another theorem often case example converse theorem right angles equal angles statement equal angles must right angles clearly always case8
generalization theorem includes previously proved theorem special case hence corollary

terms less commonly used conventionally attached proved statements certain theorems referred historical customary names example

identity equality contained theorem mathematical expressions holds regardless values used variables parameters appearing expressions examples include eulers formula vandermondes identity
rule theorem bayes rule cramers rule establishes useful formula
principle theorem applies wide range circumstances examples include large numbers cosines kolmogorovs zero–one harnacks principle leastupperbound principle pigeonhole principle9
