principia mathematicaedit




title page shortened version principia mathematica


principia mathematica 1910–1913 whiteheads famous mathematical work cowritten former student bertrand russell principia mathematica considered twentieth centurys important works mathematics placed 23rd list englishlanguage nonfiction books twentieth century modern library20
principia mathematicas purpose describe axioms inference rules symbolic logic mathematical truths could principle proven whitehead russell working foundational level mathematics logic took page volume prove proof humorously accompanied comment proposition occasionally useful55
whitehead russell thought originally principia mathematica would take year complete ended taking years56 came time publication threevolume work long 2000 pages audience narrow professional mathematicians initially published loss pounds paid cambridge university press royal society london apiece whitehead russell themselves56 despite initial loss today likely major academic library world hold copy principia mathematica57
ultimate substantive legacy principia mathematica mixed generally accepted kurt gödels incompleteness theorem 1931 definitively demonstrated axioms inference rules proposed encapsulate mathematics would fact truths mathematics could deduced hence principia mathematica could never achieve aims58 however gödel could come conclusion without whitehead russells book principia mathematicas legacy might described role disproving possibility achieving stated goals59 beyond somewhat ironic legacy book popularized modern mathematical logic drew important connections logic epistemology metaphysics60

rather teach small parts large number subjects whitehead advocated teaching relatively important concepts student could organically link many different areas knowledge discovering application actual life66 whitehead education exact opposite multidisciplinary valuefree school model6567 transdisciplinary laden values general principles provide students bedrock wisdom help make connections areas knowledge usually regarded separate

richard rummells 1906 watercolor landscape view harvard university facing northeast71 whitehead taught harvard 1924 1937


whitehead begin career philosopher23 fact never formal training philosophy beyond undergraduate education early life showed great interest respect philosophy metaphysics evident considered rank amateur letter friend former student bertrand russell discussing whether science aimed explanatory merely descriptive wrote question lands ocean metaphysic onto profound ignorance science forbids enter72 ironically later life whitehead would become 20th centurys foremost metaphysicians
however interest metaphysics philosophical investigation nature universe existence become unfashionable time whitehead began writing earnest 1920s evermore impressive accomplishments empirical science general consensus academia development comprehensive metaphysical systems waste time subject empirical testing73
whitehead unimpressed objection notes students 1927 class whitehead quoted saying every scientific order preserve reputation dislikes metaphysics means dislikes metaphysics criticized74 whiteheads view scientists philosophers make metaphysical assumptions universe works time assumptions easily seen precisely remain unexamined unquestioned whitehead acknowledged philosophers never hope finally formulate metaphysical first principles75 argued people need continually reimagine basic assumptions universe works philosophy science make real progress even progress remains permanently asymptotic reason whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations essential good science good philosophy76
perhaps foremost among whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions cartesian idea reality fundamentally constructed bits matter exist totally independently another rejected favor eventbased process ontology events primary fundamentally interrelated dependent another77 also argued basic elements reality regarded experiential indeed everything constituted experience used term experience broadly even inanimate processes electron collisions said manifest degree experience went descartes separation different kinds real existence either exclusively material else exclusively mental78 whitehead referred metaphysical system philosophy organism would become known widely process philosophy78
whiteheads philosophy highly original soon garnered interest philosophical circles publishing concept nature 1920 served president aristotelian society 1922 1923 henri bergson quoted saying whitehead best philosopher writing english79 impressive different whiteheads philosophy 1924 invited join faculty harvard university professor philosophy years age40




eckhart hall university chicago beginning arrival henry nelson wieman 1927 chicagos divinity school become closely associated whiteheads thought thirty years80


whiteheads thought widely accepted even well understood philosophical work generally considered among difficult understand western canon22 even professional philosophers struggled follow whiteheads writings famous story illustrating level difficulty whiteheads philosophy centers around delivery whiteheads gifford lectures 1927–28 following arthur eddingtons lectures year previous whitehead would later publish process reality

eddington marvellous popular lecturer enthralled audience entire course audience turned whiteheads first lecture completely unintelligible merely world large elect father remarked afterwards known whitehead well would suspected imposter making went along audience subsequent lectures half dozen all81

indeed inappropriate speculate fair portion respect generally shown whitehead philosophical peers time arose sheer bafflement distinguished university chicago divinity school theologian shailer mathews remarked whiteheads 1926 book religion making infuriating must embarrassing well read page page relatively familiar words without understanding single sentence82
however mathews frustration whiteheads books negatively affect interest fact numerous philosophers theologians chicagos divinity school perceived importance whitehead without fully grasping details implications 1927 invited americas whitehead experts henry nelson wieman chicago give lecture explaining whiteheads thought82 wiemans lecture brilliant promptly hired faculty taught twenty years least thirty years afterward chicagos divinity school closely associated whiteheads thought80
shortly whiteheads book process reality appeared 1929 wieman famously wrote 1930 review

many people read whiteheads recent book generation many read generation influence radiate concentric circles popularization common think work light knowing whence light came decades discussion analysis able understand readily done83

wiemans words proved prophetic though process reality called arguably impressive single metaphysical text twentieth century84 littleread littleunderstood partly demands isabelle stengers puts readers accept adventure questions separate every consensus85 whitehead questioned western philosophys dearly held assumptions universe works managed anticipate number 21st century scientific philosophical problems provide novel solutions86
whiteheads conception realityedit
whitehead convinced scientific notion matter misleading describing ultimate nature things 1925 book science modern world wrote

persists fixed scientific cosmology presupposes ultimate fact irreducible brute matter material spread space flux configurations material senseless valueless purposeless following fixed routine imposed external relations spring nature assumption call scientific materialism also assumption shall challenge entirely unsuited scientific situation arrived77

whiteheads view number problems notion irreducible brute matter first obscures minimizes importance change thinking material thing like rock person fundamentally thing throughout time changes secondary nature scientific materialism hides fact nothing ever stays whitehead change fundamental inescapable emphasizes things flow87
whiteheads view concepts quality matter form problematic classical concepts fail adequately account change overlook active experiential nature basic elements world useful abstractions worlds basic building blocks88 ordinarily conceived single person instance philosophically described continuum overlapping events89 people change time aged another second experience occasions experience logically distinct progressively connected whitehead calls society events90 assuming enduring objects real fundamental things universe materialists mistaken abstract concrete whitehead calls fallacy misplaced concreteness7891
another thing person often seen defining essence core identity unchanging describes thing person really thinking things people seen fundamentally time changes qualitative secondary core identity marks hair turned gray gotten older still person whiteheads cosmology fundamentally existent things discrete occasions experience overlap another time space jointly make enduring person thing hand ordinary thinking often regards essence thing identitycore person abstract generalization regarded person things important salient features across time identities define people people define identities everything changes moment moment think anything enduring essence misses fact things flow though often useful speaking
whitehead pointed limitations language main culprits maintaining materialistic thinking acknowledged difficult ever wholly move past ideas everyday speech92 moment persons life hardly given different proper name easy convenient think people objects remaining fundamentally things rather constantly keeping mind thing different thing moment limitations everyday living everyday speech prevent people realizing material substances essences convenient generalized description continuum particular concrete processes questions tenyearold person quite different time turns thirty years many ways person whitehead points philosophically ontologically sound think person second next




john locke whiteheads primary influences preface process reality whitehead wrote writer fully anticipated main positions philosophy organism john locke essay5


second problem materialism obscures importance relations sees every object distinct discrete objects object simply inert clump matter externally related things idea matter primary makes people think objects fundamentally separate time space necessarily related anything whiteheads view relations take primary role perhaps even important relata themselves93 student taking notes whiteheads fall 1924 classes wrote

reality applies connections relatively things connected real real absolutely real independent other94

fact whitehead describes entity sense nothing nothing less relations entities synthesis reaction world around it95 real thing forces rest universe conform theoretically thing made strictly difference entity related entity could said really exist96 relations secondary thing thing
must emphasizedwhy however entity merely relations also valuation reaction them97 whitehead creativity absolute principle existence every entity whether human tree electron degree novelty responds entities fully determined causal mechanistic laws98 course entities consciousness99 human beings actions cannot always predicted said trees roots grow electron move whether rain tomorrow moreover inability predict electrons movement instance faulty understanding inadequate technology rather fundamental creativityfreedom entities means always remain phenomena unpredictable100
side creativityfreedom absolute principle every entity constrained social structure existence relations actual entity must conform settled conditions world around it96 freedom always exists within limits entitys uniqueness individuality arise selfdetermination take account world within limits it101
summary whitehead rejects idea separate unchanging bits matter basic building blocks reality favor idea reality interrelated events process conceives reality composed processes dynamic becoming rather static emphasizing physical things change evolve changeless essences matter mere abstractions interrelated events final real things make world78
theory perceptionedit
since whiteheads metaphysics described universe entities experience needed describing perception limited living selfconscious beings term coined prehension comes latin prehensio meaning seize102 term meant indicate kind perception conscious unconscious applying people well electrons also intended make clear whiteheads rejection theory representative perception mind private ideas entities102 whitehead term prehension indicates perceiver actually incorporates aspects perceived thing itself102 entities constituted perceptions relations rather independent whitehead regards perception occurring modes causal efficacy physical prehension presentational immediacy conceptual prehension99
whitehead describes causal efficacy experience dominating primitive living organisms sense fate emerged fate towards go103 words sense causal relations entities feeling influenced affected surrounding environment unmediated senses presentational immediacy hand usually referred pure sense perception unmediated causal symbolic interpretation even unconscious interpretation words pure appearance delusive mistaking image mirror real thing104
higher organisms like people modes perception combine whitehead terms symbolic reference links appearance causation process automatic people animals difficulty refraining illustration whitehead uses example persons encounter chair ordinary person looks sees colored shape immediately infers chair however artist whitehead supposes might jumped notion chair instead might stopped mere contemplation beautiful color beautiful shape105 normal human reaction people place objects categories habit instinct without even thinking moreover animals thing using example whitehead points would acted immediately hypothesis chair would jumped onto using such106 symbolic reference fusion pure sense perceptions hand causal relations fact causal relationships dominate basic mentality illustrates sense perceptions indicate higher grade mentality artist illustrates107
evolution valueedit
whitehead believed asking questions basic facts existence questions value purpose never fully escaped borne thoughts abiogenesis hypothetical natural process life arises simple organic compounds
whitehead makes startling observation life comparatively deficient survival value108 humans exist hundred years rocks eight hundred million forced complex organisms ever evolved first place whitehead humorously notes certainly appear better game rocks around them109 observes mark higher forms life actively engaged modifying environment activity theorizes directed toward threefold goal living living well living better110 words whitehead sees life directed toward purpose increasing satisfaction without goal sees rise life totally unintelligible
whitehead thing wholly inert matter instead things measure freedom creativity however small allows least partly selfdirected process philosopher david griffin coined term panexperientialism idea entities experience describe whiteheads view distinguish panpsychism idea matter consciousness111

whiteheads idea differs traditional monotheistic notions112 perhaps famous pointed criticism christian conception church gave unto attributes belonged exclusively caesar113 whitehead criticizing christianity defining primarily divine king imposes world whose important attribute power opposed widely accepted forms christianity whitehead emphasized idea called brief galilean vision humility
