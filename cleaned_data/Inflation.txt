historically large infusions gold silver economy also inflation second half 15th century first half 17th western europe experienced major inflationary cycle referred price revolution2223 prices average rising perhaps sixfold years largely caused sudden influx gold silver world habsburg spain24 silver spread throughout previously cashstarved europe caused widespread inflation2526 demographic factors also contributed upward pressure prices european population growth depopulation caused black death pandemic
nineteenth century economists categorized three separate factors cause rise fall price goods change value production costs good change price money usually fluctuation commodity price metallic content currency currency depreciation resulting increased supply currency relative quantity redeemable metal backing currency following proliferation private banknote currency printed american civil term inflation started appear direct reference currency depreciation occurred quantity redeemable banknotes outstripped quantity metal available redemption time term inflation referred devaluation currency rise price goods27
relationship oversupply banknotes resulting depreciation value noted earlier classical economists david hume david ricardo would examine debate effect currency devaluation later termed monetary inflation price goods later termed price inflation eventually inflation28
adoption fiat currency many countries 18th century onwards made much larger variations supply money possible since huge increases supply paper money taken place number countries producing hyperinflations episodes extreme inflation rates much higher observed earlier periods commodity money hyperinflation weimar republic germany notable example

issues measuringedit
measuring inflation economy requires objective means differentiating changes nominal prices common goods services distinguishing price shifts resulting changes value volume quality performance example price corn changes course year change quality price difference represents inflation single price change would however represent general inflation overall economy measure overall inflation price change large basket representative goods services measured purpose price index combined price basket many goods services combined price weighted prices items basket weighted price calculated multiplying unit price item number item average consumer purchases weighted pricing necessary means measuring impact individual unit price changes economys overall inflation consumer price index example uses data collected surveying households determine proportion typical consumers overall spending spent specific goods services weights average prices items accordingly weighted average prices combined calculate overall price better relate price changes time indexes typically choose base year price assign value index prices subsequent years expressed relation base year price13 comparing inflation measures various periods take consideration base effect well
inflation measures often modified time either relative weight goods basket goods services present compared goods services past time adjustments made type goods services selected reflect changes sorts goods services purchased typical consumers products introduced older products disappear quality existing products change consumer preferences shift sorts goods services included basket weighted price used inflation measures changed time keep pace changing marketplacecitation needed
inflation numbers often seasonally adjusted differentiate expected cyclical cost shifts example home heating costs expected rise colder months seasonal adjustments often used measuring inflation compensate cyclical spikes energy fuel demand inflation numbers averaged otherwise subjected statistical techniques remove statistical noise volatility individual pricescitation needed
looking inflation economic institutions focus certain kinds prices special indices core inflation index used central banks formulate monetary policycitation needed
inflation indices calculated weighted averages selected price changes necessarily introduces distortion lead legitimate disputes true inflation rate problem overcome including available price changes calculation choosing median value35 cases governments intentionally report false inflation rates instance presidency cristina kirchner 2007–2015 government argentina criticised manipulating economic data inflation figures political gain reduce payments inflationindexed debt3637
causesedit
historically great deal economic literature concerned question causes inflation effect different schools thought causes inflation divided broad areas quality theories inflation quantity theories inflation
quality theory inflation rests expectation seller accepting currency able exchange currency later time goods desirable buyer quantity theory inflation rests quantity equation money relates money supply velocity nominal value exchanges adam smith david hume proposed quantity theory inflation money quality theory inflation productioncitation needed
currently quantity theory money widely accepted accurate model inflation long consequently broad agreement among economists long inflation rate essentially dependent growth rate money supply relative growth economy however short medium term inflation affected supply demand pressures economy influenced relative elasticity wages prices interest rates38
question whether shortterm effects last long enough important central topic debate monetarist keynesian economists monetarism prices wages adjust quickly enough make factors merely marginal behavior general trendline keynesian view prices wages adjust different rates differences enough effects real output long term view people economy
keynesian viewedit
keynesian economics proposes changes money supply directly affect prices visible inflation result pressures economy expressing prices
three major types inflation part robert gordon calls triangle model39

demandpull inflation caused increases aggregate demand increased private government spending demand inflation encourages economic growth since excess demand favourable market conditions stimulate investment expansion
costpush inflation also called supply shock inflation caused drop aggregate supply potential output natural disasters increased prices inputs example sudden decrease supply leading increased prices cause costpush inflation producers part costs could pass consumers form increased prices another example stems unexpectedly high insured losses either legitimate catastrophes fraudulent might particularly prevalent times recessioncitation needed
builtin inflation induced adaptive expectations often linked pricewage spiral involves workers trying keep wages prices rate inflation firms passing higher labor costs customers higher prices leading vicious circle builtin inflation reflects events past might seen hangover inflation

demandpull theory states inflation accelerates aggregate demand increases beyond ability economy produce potential output hence factor increases aggregate demand cause inflation40 however long aggregate demand held productive capacity increasing quantity money circulation faster real growth rate economy another although much less common cause rapid decline demand money happened europe black death japanese occupied territories defeat japan 1945
effect money inflation obvious governments finance spending crisis civil printing money excessively sometimes leads hyperinflation condition prices double month less money supply also thought play major role determining moderate levels inflation although differences opinion important example monetarist economists believe link strong keynesian economists contrast typically emphasize role aggregate demand economy rather money supply determining inflation keynesians money supply determinant aggregate demand
keynesian economists also disagree notion central banks fully control money supply arguing central banks little control since money supply adapts demand bank credit issued commercial banks known theory endogenous money advocated strongly postkeynesians back 1960s today become central focus taylor rule advocates position universally accepted banks create money making loans aggregate volume loans diminishes real interest rates increase thus central banks influence money supply making money cheaper expensive thus increasing decreasing production
fundamental concept inflation analysis relationship inflation unemployment called phillips curve model suggests tradeoff price stability employment therefore level inflation could considered desirable minimize unemployment phillips curve model described experience well 1960s failed describe stagflation experienced 1970s thus modern macroeconomics describes inflation using phillips curve able shift matters supply shocks structural inflation former refers events like 1973 crisis latter refers pricewage spiral inflationary expectations implying inflation normal thus phillips curve represents demandpull component triangle model
another concept note potential output sometimes called natural gross domestic product level economy optimal level production given institutional natural constraints level output corresponds nonaccelerating inflation rate unemployment nairu natural rate unemployment fullemployment unemployment rate exceeds potential unemployment nairu theory says inflation accelerate suppliers increase prices builtin inflation worsens falls potential level unemployment nairu inflation decelerate suppliers attempt fill excess capacity cutting prices undermining builtin inflation41
however problem theory policymaking purposes exact level potential output nairu generally unknown tends change time inflation also seems asymmetric rising quickly falls worse change policy example high unemployment british prime minister margaret thatcher might rise nairu fall potential many unemployed found structurally unemployed also unemployment unable find jobs skills rise structural unemployment implies smaller percentage labor force find jobs nairu economy avoids crossing threshold realm accelerating inflation
unemploymentedit
connection inflation unemployment drawn since emergence large scale unemployment 19th century connections continue drawn today however unemployment rate generally affects inflation shortterm longterm42 long term velocity money predictive inflation unemployment43
marxian economics unemployed serve reserve army labor restrain wage inflation 20th century similar concepts keynesian economics include nairu nonaccelerating inflation rate unemployment phillips curve

rational expectations theoryedit
details topic rational expectations theory
rational expectations theory holds economic actors look rationally future trying maximize wellbeing respond solely immediate opportunity costs pressures view generally grounded monetarism future expectations strategies important inflation well
core assertion rational expectations theory actors seek head centralbank decisions acting ways fulfill predictions higher inflation means central banks must establish credibility fighting inflation economic actors make bets central bank expand money supply rapidly enough prevent recession even expense exacerbating inflation thus central bank reputation soft inflation announces policy fighting inflation restrictive monetary growth economic agents believe policy persist inflationary expectations remain high inflation hand central bank reputation tough inflation policy announcement believed inflationary expectations come rapidly thus allowing inflation come rapidly minimal economic disruption
austrian viewedit
also austrian school monetary inflation
austrian school stresses inflation uniform assets goods services inflation depends differences markets newly created money credit enter economycitation needed ludwig mises said inflation refer increase quantity money offset corresponding increase need money price inflation necessarily follow4647
real bills doctrineedit
main article real bills doctrine
real bills doctrine asserts banks issue money exchange shortterm real bills adequate value long banks issue dollar exchange assets worth least dollar issuing banks assets naturally move step issuance money money hold value bank fail maintain assets adequate value banks money lose value financial security lose value asset backing diminishes real bills doctrine also known backing theory thus asserts inflation results money outruns issuers assets quantity theory money contrast claims inflation results money outruns economys production goods
currency banking schools economics argue banks also able issue currency bills trading real bills merchants theory important 19th century debates banking currency schools monetary soundness formation federal reserve wake collapse international gold standard post 1913 move towards deficit financing government remained minor topic primarily interest limited contexts currency boards generally held repute today frederic mishkin governor federal reserve going completely discredited

effectsedit
generaledit
increase general level prices implies decrease purchasing power currency general level prices rise monetary unit buys fewer goods services effect inflation distributed evenly economy consequence hidden costs benefits others decrease purchasing power money example inflation segments society physical assets property stock benefit pricevalue holdings going seek acquire need ability depend degree income fixed example increases payments workers pensioners often behind inflation people income fixed also individuals institutions cash assets experience decline purchasing power cash increases price level inflation erode real value money functional currency items underlying monetary nature
debtors debts fixed nominal rate interest reduction real interest rate inflation rate rises real interest loan nominal rate minus inflation rate formula approximates correct answer long nominal interest rate inflation rate small correct equation expressed ratios example inflation rate loan nominal interest rate would real interest rate approximately fact unexpected increase inflation rate would decrease real interest rate banks lenders adjust inflation risk either including inflation risk premium fixed interest rate loans lending adjustable rate
negativeedit
high unpredictable inflation rates regarded harmful overall economy inefficiencies market make difficult companies budget plan longterm inflation drag productivity companies forced shift resources away products services focus profit losses currency inflation13 uncertainty future purchasing power money discourages investment saving48 inflation also impose hidden increases instance inflated earnings push taxpayers higher income rates unless brackets indexed inflation
high inflation purchasing power redistributed fixed nominal incomes pensioners whose pensions indexed price level towards variable incomes whose earnings better keep pace inflation13 redistribution purchasing power also occur international trading partners fixed exchange rates imposed higher inflation economy another cause first economys exports become expensive affect balance trade also negative impacts trade increased instability currency exchange prices caused unpredictable inflation

costpush inflation
high inflation prompt employees demand rapid wage increases keep consumer prices costpush theory inflation rising wages turn help fuel inflation case collective bargaining wage growth function inflationary expectations higher inflation high cause wage spiral49 sense inflation begets inflationary expectations beget inflation


hoarding
people durable andor nonperishable commodities goods stores wealth avoid losses expected declining purchasing power money creating shortages hoarded goods


social unrest revolts
inflation lead massive demonstrations revolutions example inflation particular food inflation considered main reasons caused 2010–11 tunisian revolution50 2011 egyptian revolution51 according many observers including robert zoellick52 president world bank tunisian president zine abidine ousted egyptian president hosni mubarak also ousted days demonstrations protests soon spread many countries north africa middle east


hyperinflation
inflation becomes high cause people severely curtail currency leading acceleration inflation rate high accelerating inflation grossly interferes normal workings economy hurting ability supply goods hyperinflation lead abandonment countrys currency example north korea leading adoption external currency dollarization53


allocative efficiency
change supply demand good normally cause relative price change signaling buyers sellers reallocate resources response market conditions prices constantly changing inflation price changes genuine relative price signals difficult distinguish price changes general inflation agents slow respond result loss allocative efficiency


shoe leather cost
high inflation increases opportunity cost holding cash balances induce people hold greater portion assets interest paying accounts however since cash still needed carry transactions means trips bank necessary make withdrawals proverbially wearing shoe leather trip


menu costs
high inflation firms must change prices often keep economywide changes often changing prices costly activity whether explicitly need print menus implicitly extra time effort needed change prices constantly

positiveedit

labourmarket adjustments
nominal wages slow adjust downwards lead prolonged disequilibrium high unemployment labor market since inflation allows real wages fall even nominal wages kept constant moderate inflation enables labor markets reach equilibrium faster54


room maneuver
primary tools controlling money supply ability discount rate rate banks borrow central bank open market operations central banks interventions bonds market affecting nominal interest rate economy finds recession already even zero nominal interest rates bank cannot rates since negative nominal interest rates impossible stimulate economy situation known liquidity trap


mundell–tobin effect
nobel laureate robert mundell noted moderate inflation would induce savers substitute lending money holding means finance future spending substitution would cause market clearing real interest rates fall55 lower real rate interest would induce borrowing finance investment similar vein nobel laureate james tobin noted inflation would cause businesses substitute investment physical capital plant equipment inventories money balances asset portfolios substitution would mean choosing making investments lower rates real return rates return lower investments higher rates return already made before56 related effects known mundell–tobin effect unless economy already overinvesting according models economic growth theory extra investment resulting effect would seen positive


instability deflation
economist tsiang noted substantial deflation expected important effects appear result money holding substituting lending vehicle saving57 first continually falling prices resulting incentive hoard money cause instability resulting likely increasing fear money hoards grow value value hoards risk people realize movement trade money hoards real goods assets quickly drive prices movement spend hoards started would become tremendous avalanche could rampage long time would spend itself58 thus regime longterm deflation likely interrupted periodic spikes rapid inflation consequent real economic disruptions moderate stable inflation would avoid seesawing price movements


financial market inefficiency deflation
second effect noted tsiang savers substituted money holding lending financial markets role markets channeling savings investment undermined nominal interest rates driven zero near zero competition high return money asset would price mechanism whatever left markets financial markets effectively euthanized remaining goods physical asset prices would move perverse directions example increased desire save could push interest rates thereby stimulate investment would instead cause additional money hoarding driving consumer prices making investment consumer goods production thereby less attractive moderate inflation expectation incorporated nominal interest rates would give interest rates room response shifting investment opportunities savers preferences thus allow financial markets function normal fashion

controlling inflationedit

main article monetary policy
governments central banks primarily monetary policy control inflation central banks federal reserve increase interest rate slow stop growth money supply reduce money supply banks symmetrical inflation target others control inflation rises target whether express implied
central banks tasked keeping interbank lending rates levels normally target annual rate within targeted annual inflation range central bankers target inflation rate believe deflation endangers economy
higher interest rates reduce amount money fewer people seek loans loans usually made money banks make loans usually first create money lend central bank usually creates money lent national government therefore person pays back loan bank destroys money quantity money falls early 1980s federal funds rate exceeded percent quantity federal reserve dollars fell percent us86 trillion trillion
monetarists emphasize steady growth rate money monetary policy control inflation slowing rise money supply keynesians emphasize reducing aggregate demand economic expansions increasing demand recessions keep inflation stable control aggregate demand achieved using monetary policy fiscal policy increased taxation reduced government spending reduce demand
fixed exchange ratesedit
main article fixed exchange rate
fixed exchange rate currency regime countrys currency tied value another single currency basket currencies sometimes another measure value gold fixed exchange rate usually used stabilize value currency visavis currency pegged also used means control inflation however value reference currency rises falls currency pegged essentially means inflation rate fixed exchange rate country determined inflation rate country currency pegged addition fixed exchange rate prevents government using domestic monetary policy achieve macroeconomic stability
bretton woods agreement countries around world currencies fixed dollar limited inflation countries also exposed danger speculative attacks bretton woods agreement broke early 1970s countries gradually turned floating exchange rates however later part 20th century countries reverted fixed exchange rate part attempt control inflation policy using fixed exchange rate control inflation used many countries south america later part 20th century argentina 1991–2002 bolivia brazil chile

wage price controlsedit
main article incomes policy
another method attempted past wage price controls incomes policies wage price controls successful wartime environments combination rationing however contexts mixed notable failures include 1972 imposition wage price controls richard nixon successful examples include prices incomes accord australia wassenaar agreement netherlands
general wage price controls regarded temporary exceptional measure effective coupled policies designed reduce underlying causes inflation wage price control regime example winning fought often perverse effects distorted signals send market artificially prices often cause rationing shortages discourage future investment resulting shortages usual economic analysis product service underpriced overconsumed example official price bread little bread official prices little investment bread making market satisfy future needs thereby exacerbating problem long term
temporary controls complement recession fight inflation controls make recession efficient fight inflation reducing need increase unemployment recession prevents kinds distortions controls cause demand high however general advice economists impose price controls liberalize prices assuming economy adjust abandon unprofitable economic activity lower activity place fewer demands whatever commodities driving inflation whether labor resources inflation fall total economic output often produces severe recession productive capacity reallocated thus often unpopular people whose livelihoods destroyed creative destruction
