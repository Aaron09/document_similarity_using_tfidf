later umar alaziz came power reduced taxes therefore praised greatest muslim rulers four rightly guided caliphs imam muhammad adbullah abdul hakam lived wrote biography umar adbul aziz78 stated reduction taxes stimulated economy created wealth also reduced government budget reduction defense budget
umayyad ruler caliphs damascus umar alaziz unanimously praised sunni sources devout piety justice efforts spread islam established liberties mawali abolishing jizya converts islam imam muhammad adbullah abdul hakam stated umar alaziz also stopped personal allowance offered relatives stating could give allowance gave allowance everyone else empire umar alaziz later poisoned year successive governments tried reverse umar alazizs policies created rebellion
