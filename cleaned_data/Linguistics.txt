dialectedit
dialect variety language characteristic particular group among language speakers28 group people speakers dialect usually bound social identity differentiates dialect register discourse latter case cultural identity always play role dialects speech varieties grammatical phonological rules linguistic features stylistic aspects given official status language dialects often move gain status language political social reasons differentiation amongst dialects subsequently languages based upon grammatical rules syntactic rules stylistic features though always lexical vocabulary popular saying language dialect army navy attributed definition formulated weinreich
universal grammar takes account general formal structures features common dialects languages template preexists mind infant child idea based theory generative grammar formal school linguistics whose proponents include noam chomsky follow theory work

individuals rather fond dialect make think though actually better dialect dialects good nice nasty right wrong different another mark civilised society tolerates different dialects tolerates different races religions sexes29

sourcesedit
contemporary linguists work assumption spoken data signed data fundamental written data

speech appears universal human beings capable producing perceiving many cultures speech communities lack written communication
features appear speech arent always recorded writing including phonological rules sound changes speech errors
natural writing systems reflect spoken language potentially signed used write even pictographic scripts like dongba writing naxi homophones pictogram text writing systems used languages changing spoken language recorded
speech evolved human beings invented writing
people learnt speak process spoken language easily earlier writing

nonetheless linguists agree study written language worthwhile valuable research relies corpus linguistics computational linguistics written language often much convenient processing large amounts linguistic data large corpora spoken language difficult create hard find typically transcribed written addition linguists turned textbased discourse occurring various formats computermediated communication viable site linguistic inquiry
