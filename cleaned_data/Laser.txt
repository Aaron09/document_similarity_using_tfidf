lasers distinguished light sources coherence spatial coherence typically expressed output narrow beam diffractionlimited laser beams focused tiny spots achieving high irradiance divergence order concentrate power great distance
temporal longitudinal coherence implies polarized wave single frequency whose phase correlated relatively great distance coherence length along beam4 beam produced thermal incoherent light source instantaneous amplitude phase vary randomly respect time position thus short coherence length
lasers characterized according wavelength vacuum single wavelength lasers actually produce radiation several modes slightly differing frequencies wavelengths often single polarization although temporal coherence implies monochromaticity lasers emit broad spectrum light emit different wavelengths light simultaneously lasers single spatial mode consequently light beams diverge required diffraction limit however devices classified lasers based method producing light stimulated emission lasers employed applications light required spatial temporal coherence could produced using simpler technologies
