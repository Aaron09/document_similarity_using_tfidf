sandstone clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly sandsized 00625 mineral particles rock fragments
sandstone composed quartz feldspar resistant minerals weathering processes earths surface seen bowens reaction series like uncemented sand sandstone color impurities within minerals common colors brown yellow grey pink white black since sandstone beds often form highly visible cliffs topographic features certain colors sandstone strongly identified certain regions
rock formations primarily composed sandstone usually allow percolation water fluids porous enough store large quantities making valuable aquifers petroleum reservoirs finegrained aquifers sandstones better able filter pollutants surface rocks cracks crevices limestone rocks fractured seismic activity

lithic framework grains pieces ancient source rock weather away individual mineral grains called lithic fragments clasts4 lithic fragments finegrained coarsegrained igneous metamorphic sedimentary rock4 although common lithic fragments found sedimentary rocks clasts volcanic rocks4
accessory minerals mineral grains sandstone commonly minerals make small percentage grains sandstone common accessory minerals include micas muscovite biotite olivine pyroxene corundum45 many accessory grains dense silicates make bulk rock heavy minerals commonly resistant weathering used indicator sandstone maturity index6 common heavy minerals include zircon tourmaline rutile hence garnet magnetite dense resistant minerals derived source rock

matrixedit
matrix fine material present within interstitial pore space framework grains4 interstitial pore space classified varieties call sandstone arenite call wacke definition differences matrices

arenites texturally clean sandstones free little matrix5
wackes texturally dirty sandstones significant amount matrix3

cementedit
cement binds siliciclastic framework grains together cement secondary mineral forms deposition burial sandstone4 cementing materials either silicate minerals nonsilicate minerals calcite4

silica cement consist either quartz opal minerals quartz common silicate mineral acts cement sandstone silica cement present quartz grains attached cement creates around quartz grain called overgrowth overgrowth retains crystallographic continuity quartz framework grain cemented opal cement found sandstones rich volcanogenic materials rarely sandstones4
calcite cement common carbonate cement calcite cement assortment smaller calcite crystals cement adheres framework grains adhesion causes framework grains adhered together4
minerals cements include hematite limonite feldspars anhydrite gypsum barite clay minerals zeolite minerals4

pore spaceedit
pore space includes open spaces within rock soil7 pore space rock direct relationship porosity permeability rock porosity permeability directly influenced sand grains packed together4

porosity percentage bulk volume inhabited interstices within given rock7 porosity directly influenced packing evensized spherical grains rearranged loosely packed tightest packed sandstones4

sandstones composed general minerals minerals make framework components sandstones components quartz feldspars8 lithic fragments matrix also present interstitial spaces framework grains4 list several major groups sandstones groups divided based mineralogy texture even though sandstones simple compositions based framework grains geologists able agree specific right classify sandstones4 sandstone classifications typically done pointcounting thin section using method like gazzidickinson method composition sandstone important information regarding genesis sediment used triangular quartz feldspar lithic fragment diagrams many geologists however agree separate triangle parts single components framework grains plotted4 therefore many published ways classify sandstones similar general format
visual aids diagrams allow geologists interpret different characteristics sandstone following chart sandstone provenance model correspond therefore chart plotted points plotted sandstone provenance model stage textural maturity chart illustrates different stages sandstone goes

chart representation framework grains matrix present sandstone chart similar used igneous petrology plotted correctly model analysis creates meaningful quantitative classification sandstones9

dotts classification schemeedit
dotts 1964 sandstone classification scheme many schemes used geologists classifying sandstones dotts scheme modification gilberts classification silicate sandstones incorporates folks dual textural compositional maturity concepts classification system10 philosophy behind combining gilberts folks schemes better able portray continuous nature textural variation mudstone arenite stable unstable grain composition10 dotts classification scheme based mineralogy framework grains type matrix present framework grains
specific classification scheme dott boundary arenite wackes matrix addition dott also breaks different types framework grains present sandstone three major categories quartz feldspar lithic grains4

arenites types sandstone less clay matrix framework grains

quartz arenites sandstones contain siliceous grains grains include quartz chert rock fragments4 quartz arenites texturally mature supermature sandstones pure quartz sands result extensive weathering occurred transport weathering removed everything quartz grains stable mineral commonly affiliated rocks deposited stable cratonic environment aeolian beaches shelf environments4 quartz arenites emanate multiple recycling quarts grains generally sedimentary source rocks less regularly firstcycle deposits derived primary igneous metamorphic rocks4
feldspathic arenites sandstones contain less quartz feldspar unstable lithic fragments minor accessory minerals4 feldspathic sandstones commonly immature submature4 sandstones occur association cratonic stable shelf settings4 feldspathic sandstones derived granitictype primary crystalline rocks4 sandstone dominantly plagioclase igneous origin4
lithic arenites characterised generally high content unstable lithic fragments examples include volcanic metamorphic clasts though stable clasts chert common lithic arenites4 type rock contains less quartz grains unstable rock fragments feldspars4 commonly immature submature texturally4 associated fluvial conglomerates fluvial deposits deeper water marine conglomerates4 formed conditions produce large volumes unstable material derived finegrained rocks mostly shales volcanic rocks metamorphic rock4


wackes sandstones contain clay matrix framework grains

quartz wackes uncommon quartz arenites texturally mature supermature4
felspathic wackes feldspathic sandstone contain matrix greater
lithic wacke sandstone matrix greater


arkose sandstones percent feldspar1 grains tend poorly rounded less well sorted pure quartz sandstones feldsparrich sandstones come rapidly eroding granitic metamorphic terrains chemical weathering subordinate physical weathering
