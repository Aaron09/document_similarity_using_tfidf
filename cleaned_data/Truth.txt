coherence theories general truth requires proper elements within whole system often though coherence taken imply something simple logical consistency often demand propositions coherent system lend mutual inferential support example completeness comprehensiveness underlying concepts critical factor judging validity usefulness coherent system31 pervasive tenet coherence theories idea truth primarily property whole systems propositions ascribed individual propositions according coherence whole among assortment perspectives commonly regarded coherence theory theorists differ question whether coherence entails many possible true systems thought single absolute system
variants coherence theory claimed describe essential intrinsic properties formal systems logic mathematics32 however formal reasoners content contemplate axiomatically independent sometimes mutually contradictory systems side side example various alternative geometries whole coherence theories rejected lacking justification application areas truth especially respect assertions natural world empirical data general assertions practical matters psychology society especially used without support major theories truth33
coherence theories distinguish thought rationalist philosophers particularly spinoza leibniz hegel along british philosopher bradley34 found resurgence also among several proponents logical positivism notably otto neurath carl hempel

peirce defines truth follows truth concordance abstract statement ideal limit towards endless investigation would tend bring scientific belief concordance abstract statement possess virtue confession inaccuracy onesidedness confession essential ingredient truth41 statement stresses peirces view ideas approximation incompleteness partiality describes elsewhere fallibilism reference future essential proper conception truth although peirce uses words like concordance correspondence describe aspect pragmatic sign relation also quite explicit saying definitions truth based mere correspondence nominal definitions accords lower status real definitions
william jamess version pragmatic theory complex often summarized statement true expedient thinking right expedient behaving42 james meant truth quality value confirmed effectiveness applying concepts practice thus pragmatic
john dewey less broadly james broadly peirce held inquiry whether scientific technical sociological philosophical cultural selfcorrective time openly submitted testing community inquirers order clarify justify refine andor refute proposed truths43
though widely known variation pragmatic theory defined wielded successfully 20th century forward defined named william ernest hocking variation known negative pragmatism essentially works true fails cannot true truth always works44 richard feynman also ascribed never definitely right sure wrong45 approach incorporates many ideas peirce james dewey peirce idea endless investigation would tend bring scientific belief fits negative pragmatism negative pragmatist would never stop testing feynman noted idea theory could never proved right tomorrows experiment might succeed proving wrong thought right45 similarly james deweys ideas also ascribe truth repeated testing selfcorrective time
pragmatism negative pragmatism also closely aligned coherence theory truth testing isolated rather incorporate knowledge human endeavors experience universe whole integrated system testing acknowledge account diversity feynman said disagrees experiment wrong46
minimalist deflationary theoriesedit
main article deflationary theory truth

kripkes theory truthedit
saul kripke contends natural language fact contain truth predicate without giving rise contradiction showed construct follows

begin subset sentences natural language contains occurrences expression true false barn included subset barn true problematic sentences sentence false
define truth sentences subset
extend definition truth include sentences predicate truth falsity original subset sentences barn true included either sentence false barn true true
next define truth sentences predicate truth falsity member second imagine process repeated infinitely truth defined barn barn true barn true true

notice truth never gets defined sentences like sentence false since original subset predicate truth sentence original subsequent kripkes terms ungrounded since sentences never assigned either truth falsehood even process carried infinitely kripkes theory implies sentences neither true false contradicts principle bivalence every sentence must either true false since principle premise deriving liar paradox paradox dissolved63
