construction reservoir valley usually need river diverted part build often temporary tunnel bypass channel3
hilly regions reservoirs often constructed enlarging existing lakes sometimes reservoirs water level exceeds watershed height feeder streams llyn clywedog wales4 cases additional side dams required contain reservoir

bankside reservoiredit
water pumped siphoned river variable quality size bankside reservoirs built store water reservoirs usually formed partly excavation partly building complete encircling bund embankment exceed miles circumference6 floor reservoir bund must impermeable lining core initially often made puddled clay generally superseded modern rolled clay water stored reservoirs stay several months time normal biological processes substantially reduce many contaminants almost eliminate turbidity bankside reservoirs also allows water abstraction stopped time river unacceptably polluted flow conditions drought london water supply system example bankside storage water taken river thames river several large thamesside reservoirs queen mary reservoir seen along approach london heathrow airport6
service reservoiredit
service reservoirs7 store fully treated potable water close point distribution many service reservoirs constructed water towers often elevated structures concrete pillars landscape relatively flat service reservoirs almost entirely underground especially hilly mountainous country united kingdom thames water many underground reservoirs sometimes also called cisterns built 1800s lined brick good example honor reservoir london constructed 1901 1909 completed said largest brick built underground reservoir world8 still largest europe9 reservoir forms part southern extension thames water ring main reservoir grassed used aquarius golf club10
service reservoirs perform several functions including ensuring sufficient head water water distribution system providing water capacity even peak demand consumers enabling treatment plant optimum efficiency large service reservoirs also managed reduce cost pumping refilling reservoir times energy costs

flow balancingedit
reservoirs used balance flow highly managed systems taking water high flows releasing flows order work without pumping requires careful control water levels using spillways major storm approaches operators calculate volume water storm reservoir forecast storm water overfill reservoir water slowly reservoir prior storm done sufficient lead time major storm fill reservoir areas downstream experience damaging flows accurate weather forecasts essential operators correctly plan drawdowns prior high rainfall event operators blamed faulty weather forecast 2010–2011 queensland floods examples highly managed reservoirs burrendong australia bala lake llyn tegid north wales bala lake natural lake whose level raised river flows discharges depending upon flow conditions part river regulation system mode operation form hydraulic capacitance river system

biologyedit
dams produce block migrating fish trapping area producing food habitat various waterbirds also flood various ecosystems land cause extinctions
human impactedit
dams severely reduce amount water reaching countries downstream causing water stress countries sudan egypt damages farming businesses downstream countries reduces drinking water
farms villages ashopton flooded creation reservoirs ruining many livelihoods reason worldwide million people figure 2009 edexcel gcse geography textbook forcibly relocated construction
limnologyedit
limnology reservoirs many similarities lakes equivalent size however significant differences35 many reservoirs experience considerable variations level producing significant areas intermittently underwater dried greatly limits productivity water margins also limits number species able survive conditions
upland reservoirs tend much shorter residence time natural lakes lead rapid cycling nutrients water body quickly lost system seen mismatch water chemistry water biology tendency biological component oligotrophic chemistry would suggest
conversely lowland reservoirs drawing water nutrient rich rivers show exaggerated eutrophic characteristics residence time reservoir much greater river biological systems much greater opportunity utilise available nutrients
deep reservoirs multiple level draw towers discharge deep cold water downstream river greatly reducing size hypolimnion turn reduce concentrations phosphorus released annual mixing event therefore reduce productivity
