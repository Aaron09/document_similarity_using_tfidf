neoplasm benign potentially malignant malignant cancer7

benign tumors include uterine fibroids melanocytic nevi skin moles circumscribed localized transform cancer6
potentiallymalignant neoplasms include carcinoma situ localised invade destroy time transform cancer
malignant neoplasms commonly called cancer invade destroy surrounding tissue form metastases untreated unresponsive treatment prove fatal
secondary neoplasm refers class cancerous tumor either metastatic offshoot primary tumor apparently unrelated tumor increases frequency following certain cancer treatments chemotherapy radiotherapy
rarely metastatic neoplasm known site primary cancer classed cancer unknown primary origin

clonalityedit
neoplastic tumors often heterogeneous contain type cell initiation continued growth usually dependent single population neoplastic cells cells presumed clonal derived cell8 carry genetic epigenetic anomaly evident clonality lymphoid neoplasms lymphoma leukemia clonality proven amplification single rearrangement immunoglobulin gene cell lesions cell receptor gene cell lesions demonstration clonality considered necessary identify lymphoid cell proliferation neoplastic9
tempting define neoplasms clonal cellular proliferations demonstration clonality always possible therefore clonality required definition neoplasia
