characteristicsedit
characteristics

cells spread extracellular fluid
ground substance clear colorless viscous fluid containing glycosaminoglycans proteoglycans body water collagen fibers intercellular spaces ground substance slows spread pathogens
fibers types fibrous examples nonfibrous include adipose tissue blood adipose tissue gives mechanical cushioning body among functions1011 although dense collagen network adipose tissue groups adipose cells kept together collagen fibers collagen sheets order keep tissue compression place example sole foot matrix blood plasma
ground substance proteins fibers create matrix connective tissues derived mesenchyme

functionedit
connective tissue wide variety functions depend types cells different classes fibers involved loose dense irregular connective tissue formed mainly fibroblasts collagen fibers important role providing medium oxygen nutrients diffuse capillaries cells carbon dioxide waste substances diffuse cells back circulation also allow organs resist stretching tearing forces dense regular connective tissue forms organized structures major functional component tendons ligaments aponeuroses also found highly specialized organs cornea12161 elastic fibers made elastin fibrillin also provide resistance stretch forces12171 found walls large blood vessels certain ligaments particularly ligamenta flava12173
hematopoietic lymphatic tissues reticular fibers made reticular cells provide stroma—or structural support—for parenchyma—or functional part—of organ12171
mesenchyme type connective tissue found developing organs embryos capable differentiation types mature connective tissue13 another type relatively undifferentiated connective tissue mucous connective tissue found inside umbilical cord12160
various types specialized tissues cells classified spectrum connective tissue diverse brown white adipose tissue blood cartilage bone12158 cells immune system macrophages mast cells plasma cells eosinophils found scattered loose connective tissue providing ground starting inflammatory immune responses upon detection antigens12161
