since minor planet designations change time different versions used astronomy journals mainbelt asteroid 274301 wikipedia discovered august 2008 provisionally designated 2008 qh24 received number written 274301 2008 qh24 january 2013 named wikipedia published minor planet circulars45
according preference astronomer publishing date journal 274301 wikipedia referred 2008 qh24 simply 274301 practice reasonably wellknown object number mostly catalogue entry name provisional designation generally used place formal designation pluto rarely written 134340 pluto 2002 tx300 commonly used longer version 55636 2002 tx300
