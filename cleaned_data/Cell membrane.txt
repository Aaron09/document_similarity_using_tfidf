history
main article history cell membrane theory
robert hooke’s discovery cells 1665 proposal cell theory hooke misled cell membrane theory cells contained hard cell wall since plant cells could observed time7 microscopists focused cell wall well years advances microscopy made early 19th century cells recognized separate entities unconnected bound individual cell walls found plant cells could separated theory extended include animal cells suggest universal mechanism cell protection development second half 19th century microscopy still advanced enough make distinction cell membranes cell walls however microscopists correctly identified time invisible could inferred cell membranes existed animal cells intracellular movement components internally externally membranes weren’t equivalent cell wall plant cell also inferred cell membranes weren’t vital components cells many refuted existence cell membrane still towards 19th century 1890 update cell theory stated cell membranes existed merely secondary structures wasn’t later studies osmosis permeability cell membranes gained recognition7 1895 ernest overton proposed cell membranes made lipids8
lipid bilayer hypothesis proposed 1925 gorter grendel9 created speculation description cell membrane bilayer structure based crystallographic studies soap bubble observations attempt accept reject hypothesis researchers measured membrane thickness7 1925 determined fricke thickness erythrocyte yeast cell membranes ranged thickness compatible lipid monolayer choice dielectric constant used studies called question future tests could disprove results initial experiment independently leptoscope invented order measure thin membranes comparing intensity light reflected sample intensity membrane standard known thickness instrument could resolve thicknesses depended measurements presence membrane proteins ranged lower measurements supporting lipid bilayer hypothesis later 1930s membrane structure model developed general agreement paucimolecular model davson danielli 1935 model based studies surface tension oils echinoderm eggs since surface tension values appeared much lower would expected oil–water interface assumed substance responsible lowering interfacial tensions surface cells suggested lipid bilayer thin protein layers paucimolecular model immediately became popular dominated cell membrane studies following years became rivaled fluid mosaic model singer nicolson 1972107
despite numerous models cell membrane proposed prior fluid mosaic model remains primary archetype cell membrane long inception 1970s7 although fluid mosaic model modernized detail contemporary discoveries basics remained constant membrane lipid bilayer composed hydrophilic exterior heads hydrophobic interior proteins interact hydrophilic heads polar interactions proteins span bilayer fully partially hydrophobic amino acids interact nonpolar lipid interior fluid mosaic model provided accurate representation membrane mechanics enhanced study hydrophobic forces would later develop essential descriptive limitation describe biological macromolecules
many centuries scientists cited disagreed significance structure seeing cell membrane almost centuries membranes seen mostly disregarded important structure cellular function wasn’t 20th century significance cell membrane acknowledged finally scientists gorter grendel 1925 made discovery membrane “lipidbased” furthered idea structure would formation mimicked layers studied found comparing cell surfaces surfaces lipids ratio estimated thus providing first basis bilayer structure known today discovery initiated many studies arose globally within various fields scientific studies confirming structure functions cell membrane widely accepted7
