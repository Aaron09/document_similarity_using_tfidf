history videotelephony covers historical development several technologies enable live video addition voice telecommunications concept videotelephony first popularized late 1870s united states europe although basic sciences permit earliest trials would take nearly half century discovered first embodied device came known video telephone videophone evolved intensive research experimentation several telecommunication fields notably electrical telegraphy telephony radio television
development crucial video technology first started latter half 1920s united kingdom united states spurred notably john logie baird atts bell labs occurred part least serve adjunct supplementing telephone number organizations believed videotelephony would superior plain voice communications however video technology deployed analog television broadcasting long could become practical—or popular—for videophones
videotelephony developed parallel conventional voice telephone systems midtolate 20th century expensive videoconferencing systems rapidly evolved throughout 1980s 1990s proprietary equipment software network requirements standardsbased technologies readily available general public reasonable cost late 20th century advent powerful video codecs combined highspeed internet broadband isdn service videotelephony become practical technology regular
rapid improvements popularity internet videotelephony become widespread deployment videoenabled mobile phones plus videoconferencing computer webcams utilize internet telephony upper echelons government business commerce telepresence technology advanced form videoconferencing helped reduce need travel
