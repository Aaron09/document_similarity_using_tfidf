classical statistical mechanics requires existence define value3 eventually following upon plancks discovery recognized physical action cannot take arbitrary value instead must multiple small quantity quantum action called planck constant socalled quantum theory developed bohr sommerfeld particle trajectories exist hidden quantum laws constrain based action view largely replaced fully modern quantum theory definite trajectories motion even exist rather particle represented wavefunction spread space time thus value action classically defined related concept energy quantization existed quantum theory also exists altered form modern quantum physics classical physics cannot explain either quantization energy lack classical particle motion

last years nineteenth century planck investigating problem blackbody radiation first posed kirchhoff forty years earlier well known objects glow hotter objects glow brighter cooler ones electromagnetic field obeys laws motion similarly mass spring come thermal equilibrium atoms object equilibrium light absorbs much light emits object black meaning absorbs light hits thermal light emission maximized
assumption blackbody radiation thermal leads accurate prediction total amount emitted energy goes temperature according definite rule stefan–boltzmann 1879–84 also known colour light given object changes temperature white hotter nevertheless wilhelm wien discovered mathematical relationship peaks curves different temperatures using principle adiabatic invariance different temperature curve moved wiens displacement 1893 wien also proposed approximation spectrum object correct high frequencies short wavelength frequencies long wavelength7 still clear spectrum object form diagram
planck hypothesized equations motion light describe harmonic oscillators possible frequency examined entropy oscillators varied temperature body trying match wiens able derive approximate mathematical function blackbody spectrum8
however planck soon realized solution unique several different solutions gave different value entropy oscillators8 save theory planck resort using controversial theory statistical mechanics8 described despair ready sacrifice previous convictions physics9 boundary conditions

interpret vibrational energy oscillators continuous infinitely divisible quantity discrete quantity composed integral number finite equal parts call part energy element
planck distribution energy normal spectrum8

condition planck imposed quantization energy oscillators purely formal assumption actually think much words10 would revolutionize physics applying approach wiens displacement showed energy element must proportional frequency oscillator first version sometimes termed planck–einstein relation
