modern digital computer represents data using binary numeral system text numbers pictures audio nearly form information converted string bits binary digits value common unit storage byte equal bits piece information handled computer device whose storage space large enough accommodate binary representation piece information simply data example complete works shakespeare 1250 pages print stored five megabytes million bits byte character
data encoded assigning pattern character digit multimedia object many standards exist encoding character encodings like ascii image encodings like jpeg video encodings like mpeg4
adding bits encoded unit redundancy allows computer detect errors coded data correct based mathematical algorithms errors generally occur probabilities random value flipping physical fatigue loss physical storage ability maintain distinguishable value errors inter intracomputer communication random flip random radiation typically corrected upon detection group malfunctioning physical bits always specific defective known group definition depends specific storage device typically automatically fencedout taken device replaced another functioning equivalent group device corrected values restored possible cyclic redundancy check method typically used communications storage error detection detected error retried
