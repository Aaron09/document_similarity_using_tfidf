discussion concepts heaviness weight lightness levity date back ancient greek philosophers typically viewed inherent properties objects plato described weight natural tendency objects seek aristotle weight levity represented tendency restore natural order basic elements earth fire water ascribed absolute weight earth absolute levity fire archimedes weight quality opposed buoyancy conflict determining object sinks floats first operational definition weight given euclid defined weight weight heaviness lightness thing compared another measured balance2 operational balances rather definitions however around much longer6
according aristotle weight direct cause falling motion object speed falling object supposed directly proportionate weight object medieval scholars discovered practice speed falling object increased time prompted change concept weight maintain cause effect relationship weight split still weight pondus remained constant actual gravity gravitas changed object fell concept gravitas eventually replaced jean buridans impetus precursor momentum2
rise copernican view world resurgence platonic idea like objects attract context heavenly bodies 17th century galileo made significant advances concept weight proposed measure difference weight moving object object rest ultimately concluded weight proportionate amount matter object speed motion supposed aristotelean view physics2
newtonedit
introduction newtons laws motion development newtons universal gravitation considerable development concept weight weight became fundamentally separate mass mass identified fundamental property objects connected inertia weight became identified force gravity object therefore dependent context object particular newton considered weight relative another object causing gravitational pull weight earth towards sun2
newton considered time space absolute allowed consider concepts true position true velocityclarification needed newton also recognized weight measured action weighing affected environmental factors buoyancy considered false weight induced imperfect measurement conditions introduced term apparent weight compared true weight defined gravity2
although newtonian physics made clear distinction weight mass term weight continued commonly used people meant mass general conference weights measures cgpm 1901 officially declare word weight denotes quantity nature force weight body product mass acceleration gravity thus distinguishing mass official usage
relativityedit
20th century newtonian concepts absolute time space challenged relativity einsteins principle equivalence observers moving accelerating footing ambiguity exactly meant force gravity weight scale accelerating elevator cannot distinguished scale gravitational field gravitational force weight thereby became essentially framedependent quantities prompted abandonment concept superfluous fundamental sciences physics chemistry nonetheless concept remained important teaching physics ambiguities introduced relativity starting 1960s considerable debate teaching community define weight students choosing nominal definition weight force gravity operational definition defined weighing2

several definitions exist weight equivalent3789
gravitational definitionedit
common definition weight found introductory physics textbooks defines weight force exerted body gravity19 often expressed formula weight mass object gravitational acceleration
1901 general conference weights measures cgpm established official definition weight

word weight denotes quantity naturenote force weight body product mass acceleration gravity
resolution general conference weights measures1112

resolution defines weight vector since force vector quantity however textbooks also take weight scalar defining

weight body equal magnitude gravitational force body13

gravitational acceleration varies place place sometimes simply taken standard value 980665 gives standard weight11
force whose magnitude equal newtons also known kilogram weight term abbreviated kgwt14


measuring weight versus mass







left spring scale measures weight seeing much object pushes spring inside device moon object would give lower reading right balance scale indirectly measures mass comparing object references moon object would give reading object references would become lighter


operational definitionedit
operational definition weight object force measured operation weighing force exerts support7 since wdownward force body centre earth acceleration body exists opposite equal force support body also equal force exerted body support action reaction numerical value opposite direction make considerable difference depending details example object free fall exerts little force support situation commonly referred weightlessness however free fall affect weight according gravitational definition therefore operational definition sometimes refined requiring object restcitation needed however raises issue defining rest usually rest respect earth implied using standard gravitycitation needed operational definition weight object rest surface earth lessened effect centrifugal force earths rotation
operational definition usually given explicitly exclude effects buoyancy reduces measured weight object immersed fluid water result floating balloon object floating water might said zero weight

main article mass versus weight
modern scientific usage weight mass fundamentally different quantities mass extrinsic extensive property matter whereas weight force results action gravity matter measures strongly force gravity pulls matter however practical everyday situations word weight used strictly mass meant418 example people would object weighs kilogram even though kilogram unit mass
distinction mass weight unimportant many practical purposes strength gravity vary much surface earth uniform gravitational field gravitational force exerted object weight directly proportional mass example object weighs times much object therefore mass object times greater object means objects mass measured indirectly weight everyday purposes weighing using weighing scale entirely acceptable measuring mass similarly balance measures mass indirectly comparing weight measured item objects known mass since measured item comparison mass virtually location experiencing gravitational field effect varying gravity affect comparison resulting measurement
earths gravitational field uniform vary much 0519 different locations earth earths gravity variations alter relationship weight mass must taken account high precision weight measurements intended indirectly measure mass spring scales measure local weight must calibrated location objects used show standard weight legal commercecitation needed
