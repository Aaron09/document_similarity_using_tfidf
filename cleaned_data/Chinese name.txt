historyedit
although terms ancient chinese naming system xìng míng still used today used different complex ways modern china
first half millennium zhou dynasty members chinese nobility could possess four different names—personal names míng clan names xìng lineage names style courtesy names 字—and titles standard titles posthumous titles shìhào commoners possessed personal name ming modern concept surname family name exist level society1 lineage clan names xing began become family names modern sense trickle commoners around late spring autumn period process took several centuries complete late dynasty centuries chinese commoners surnames2
family namesedit
main article chinese surname
although currently 4000 chinese surnames xìng china3 colloquial expression chinese people bǎixìng hundred surnames mere hundred surnames still make chinas billion citizens4 fact three—wang zhang 張—cover population4 homogeneity results great majority family names character small number compound surnames mostly restricted minority groups3 always true chinese history first fifth centuries multiplecharacter personal names briefly popularized twocharacter surnames number important figures like zhuge liang sima qian possessed themcitation needed
chinese surnames arose separate prehistoric traditions xìng original xìng clans royalty shang court always included woman radical originate families denoted fiefs states titles granted recognized shang court apart jiang families original xìng nearly disappeared terms ironically reversed meaning xìng used describe surnames replaced used refer maiden names
enormous modern clans sometimes share ancestral halls another actually consist many different lineages gathered single name example surname includes descendants warring states–era bureaucrat zhao descendants subjects fief mafu koreans unrelated confederation muslims western china chose honor muhammad5 nonetheless however tenuous bonds sometimes remains minor taboo marry someone family name
traditionally married woman keeps name unchanged without adopting husbands surname6 child would inherit hisher fathers surname still norm mainland china though marriage explicitly states child either parents surname also possible though less common child combine parents surnames western influence areas greater china hong kong macau also adopted tradition women changing last name prepending husband’s
given namesedit
main article chinese given name
chinese given names míngzi show much greater diversity surnames still restricted almost universally syllables including variant forms least 106000 individual chinese characters7 2006 peoples republic china public security bureau approximately 32000 supported computer input8 even fewer common given names chosen based range factors including possession pleasing sound tonal qualities well bearing positive associations beautiful shape twocharacter ming chosen characters separate meaning qualities name remains single unit almost always said together even combination longer means anything
today twocharacter names common make chinese names9 however custom consistent since ming dynasty names character long early rose beyond usurping wang mang banned twocharacter names outright although dynasty shortlived repealed years later northern invasions interest establishing lineages revived interest longer names9 tang song populations majority twocharacter names first time liao yuan afterward preferred single character names restoration dominance ming promotion culture qing development generation names established current traditions9
given names resonant qualities perceived either masculine feminine frequently given males linked strength firmness females beauty flowers also common female names employ diminutives like xiǎo doubled characters formal names although famous male examples xiaoping yoyo people countryside previously often bore names reflect rural life—for example daniu dazhu pole—but names becoming less common
also considered form name child famous person although tens thousands might happen share common name xiang10 similarly owing traditional naming taboos uncommon china name child directly relative since children would permit junior family members inappropriately personal names senior ones ancestors leave different kind mark chinese naming schemes often employ generation name every child recorded family records generation would share identical character names sixteen thirtytwo generations would worked advance form generation poem example selected 1737 family zedong readcitation needed







立显荣朝士，stand tall display unstintingly gentlemen
文方运际祥。and study method expand borders fortune
祖恩贻泽远，ancestral favors bequeath kindness ages
世代永承昌。descendants forever obliged prosperity







scheme fourteenth generation rejected naming children preferring give sons generational name lofty proud insteadcitation needed similar practice observed regarding stage names chinese opera performers students entering training academy year would adopt first character given name example part class entering national drama school 1933 yuru adopted name central character jade
depending region particular family daughters entered family records thus share boys generation name although borne separate among even generation names used siblings names frequently related named song pine might sister named plum
traditional female names sometimes also reflected male chauvinism ancient china names like laidi zhaodi pandi essentially meaning seeking little brother similar name yehao meaning also goodcitation needed
recently although chauvinistic names become rarity generation names become less common many personal names reflect periods chinese history example following victory communists civil many chinese bore revolutionary names qiangguo strong nation strengthening nation dongfeng eastern wind similarly taiwan used common incorporate four characters name republic china 中華民國 zhōnghuá mínguó masculine names periodic names like aoyun olympics also appear owing effects also recent trend china hire fortune tellers change peoples names ones accordance traditional taoist five element practices
spellingedit
main articles pinyin romanization chinese
process converting chinese names phonetic alphabet called romanization
mainland china chinese names romanized using hanyu pinyin system since 1958 although experiments complete conversion chinese pinyin alphabet failed12 remains common become transcription system government singapore united nations international organization standardization13 many decades avoiding taiwan formally adopted pinyin phonetic system 20091415 although continues allow citizens romanizations official documents passports system easily identified frequent letters uncommon english tones included noted tone marks pinyin written zédōng
proper pinyin romanization means treating surname given name precisely separate words spaces letters multiple chinese characters example properly rendered either tone marks wáng xiùyīng without wang xiuying written wang ying wang xiuying wangxiuying rare cases surname consists character written unit sima qian qian maqian however chinese language makes almost spaces native speakers often don‘t know rules simply space chinese character name causing used alphabetical languages think xing ming three words instead
switch pinyin still quite taiwan many nonstandard spellings continue found including soong similarly many taiwanese historic names still employ older wade–giles system englishinfluenced system identified digraphs pinyin pinyin hyphens connect syllables multicharacter words correct reading depends inclusion superscript numbers apostrophes distinguish different consonants practice commonly omitted wade–giles written tsetung system hyphenates names characters example wang xiuying sima qian written wade wang2 hsiu4ying1 ssu1ma3 chien1
pinyin wadegiles represent pronunciation mandarin based beijing dialect hong kong macau diaspora communities southeast asia abroad chinese often romanize according sounds local chinese dialect lingua franca language mostly spoken area country settled particularly cantonese hokkien hakka occurs amid plethora competing romanization systems hong kong many chinese grew british occupation adopted english spelling conventions names shaw forth macau chinese names similarly sometimes still transliterated based portuguese orthography yuetping chinese hong kong macau diaspora communities malaysia singapore fully divide characters names spaces matter course
final point that—although characters remained roughly since dynasty classical grammar still part core curriculum chinese secondary schools—vocabulary grammar pronunciation changed middle modern chinese even within prestige dialects thus although modern chinese read confucius kǒng fūzǐ pinyin16 course time addressed courtesy name zhòngní instead16
