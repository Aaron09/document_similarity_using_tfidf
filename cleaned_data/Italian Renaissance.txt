origins backgroundedit
northern central italy late middle agesedit
late middle ages circa 1300 onward latium former heartland roman empire southern italy generally poorer north rome city ancient ruins papal states loosely administered vulnerable external interference france later spain papacy affronted avignon papacy created southern france consequence pressure king philip fair france south sicily time foreign domination arabs normans sicily prospered years emirate sicily later centuries norman kingdom hohenstaufen kingdom declined late middle ages
contrast northern central italy become prosperous calculated region among richest europe crusades built lasting trade links levant fourth crusade done much destroy byzantine roman empire commercial rival venetians genoese main trade routes east passed byzantine empire arab lands onward ports genoa pisa venice luxury goods bought levant spices dyes silks imported italy resold throughout europe moreover inland citystates profited rich agricultural land valley france germany countries medium champagne fairs land river trade routes brought goods wool wheat precious metals region extensive trade stretched egypt baltic generated substantial surpluses allowed significant investment mining agriculture thus northern italy richer resources many parts europe level development stimulated trade allowed prosper particular florence became wealthiest cities northern italy mainly woolen textile production developed supervision dominant trade guild arte della lana wool imported northern europe 16th century spain4 together dyes east used make high quality textiles
italian trade routes covered mediterranean beyond also major conduits culture knowledge recovery lost greek classics lesser extent arab advancements following crusader conquest byzantine heartlands revitalized medieval philosophy renaissance 12th century refugee byzantine scholars migrated italy following ottomans conquest byzantines 12th 15th centuries important sparking linguistic studies renaissance newly created academies florence venice humanist scholars searched monastic libraries ancient manuscripts recovered tacitus latin authors rediscovery vitruvius meant architectural principles antiquity could observed renaissance artists encouraged atmosphere humanist optimism excel achievements ancients like apelles read

fourteenthcentury collapseedit

period instability renaissance authors dante petrarch lived first stirrings renaissance seen notably realism giotto paradoxically disasters would help establish renaissance black death wiped third europes population resulting labour shortage increased wages reduced population therefore much wealthier better significantly surplus money spend luxury goods incidences plague began decline early 15th century europes devastated population began grow demand products services also helped create growing class bankers merchants skilled artisans horrors black death seeming inability church provide relief would contribute decline church influence additionally collapse bardi peruzzi banks would open medici rise prominence florence roberto sabatino lopez argues economic collapse crucial cause renaissance9 according view prosperous businessmen would quickly reinvested earnings order make money climate favourable investment however leaner years 14th century wealthy found promising investment opportunities earnings instead chose spend culture
