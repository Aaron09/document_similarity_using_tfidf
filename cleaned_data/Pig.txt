habitat reproduction
wild scrofa take advantage forage resources therefore live virtually productive habitat provide enough water sustain large mammals pigs increased foraging wild pigs certain areas cause nutritional shortage cause population decrease nutritional state returns normal population likely rise pigs naturally increased reproduction rate12
diet foraging
pigs omnivores means consume plants animals wild foraging animals primarily eating leaves roots fruits flowers addition insects fish livestock pigs mostly corn soybean meal13 mixture vitamins minerals added diet traditionally raised dairy farms called mortgage lifters ability excess milk well whey cheese butter making combined pasture14 older pigs consume three five gallons water day15 kept pets optimal healthy diet consists mainly balanced diet vegetables although handlers give pigs conventional mini pellet feed16
