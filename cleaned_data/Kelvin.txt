lord kelvin namesake unit


1848 william thomson later made lord kelvin wrote paper absolute thermometric scale need scale whereby infinite cold absolute zero scales null point used degree celsius unit increment kelvin calculated absolute zero equivalent −273 thermometers time2 absolute scale known today kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale kelvins value −273 negative reciprocal 000366—the accepted expansion coefficient degree celsius relative point giving remarkable consistency currently accepted value
1954 resolution 10th general conference weights measures cgpm gave kelvin scale modern definition designating triple point water second defining point assigned temperature exactly 27316 kelvins3
19671968 resolution 13th cgpm renamed unit increment thermodynamic temperature kelvin symbol replacing degree kelvin symbol furthermore feeling useful explicitly define magnitude unit increment 13th cgpm also held resolution kelvin unit thermodynamic temperature equal fraction ​1⁄27316 thermodynamic temperature triple point water1
2005 comité international poids mesures cipm committee cgpm affirmed purposes delineating temperature triple point water definition kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale would refer water isotopic composition specified vsmow5
