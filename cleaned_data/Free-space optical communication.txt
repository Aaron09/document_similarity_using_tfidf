photophone receiver headset half bell tainters optical telecommunication system 1880


optical communications various forms used thousands years ancient greeks used coded alphabetic system signalling torches developed cleoxenus democleitus polybius1 modern semaphores wireless solar telegraphs called heliographs developed using coded signals communicate recipients
1880 alexander graham bell assistant charles sumner tainter created photophone bells newly established volta laboratory washington bell considered important invention device allowed transmission sound beam light june 1880 bell conducted worlds first wireless telephone transmission buildings meters feet apart23
first practical came military communication systems many decades later first optical telegraphy german colonial troops used heliograph telegraphy transmitters herero namaqua genocide starting 1904 german southwest africa todays namibia british french ottoman signals

darpa orca official concept created 2008


main reason terrestrial communications limited noncommercial telecommunications functions consistently keeps laser links meters achieving yearround error rate 100000 several entities continually attempting overcome disadvantages communications field system better quality service darpa sponsored us130 million research towards effort orca orcle programs131415
nongovernment groups fielding tests evaluate different technologies claim ability address adoption challenges october 2014update none fielded working system addresses common atmospheric events
research 1998–2006 private sector totaled 4071 million divided primarily among four startup companies four failed deliver products would meet telecommunications quality distance standards16

terabeam received approximately million funding lucent backed attempt1718 work ultimately failed company reorganized 200419
airfiber received million funding never solved weather issue sold communications 2003 sold units 2012 endoflife abruptly announced terescope series7
