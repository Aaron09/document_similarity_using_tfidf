historyedit
vitalismedit
main article vitalism
many centuries western physicians chemists believed vitalism widespread conception substances found organic nature created chemical elements action vital force lifeforce vitalis living organisms possess vitalism taught organic compounds fundamentally different inorganic compounds could obtained elements chemical manipulations
vitalism survived even rise modern ideas atomic theory chemical elements first came question 1824 friedrich wöhler synthesized oxalic acid compound known occur living organisms cyanogen decisive experiment wöhlers 1828 synthesis urea inorganic salts potassium cyanate ammonium sulfate urea long considered organic compound known occur urine living organisms wöhlers experiments followed many others increasingly complex organic substances produced inorganic ones without involvement living organism4
modern classificationedit




lisoleucine molecule c6h13no2 showing features typical organic compounds carbon atoms black hydrogens gray oxygens nitrogen blue


even though vitalism discredited scientific nomenclature retains distinction organic inorganic compounds modern meaning organic compound compound contains significant amount carbon—even though many organic compounds known today connection substance found living organisms
organic compound lisoleucine molecule presents features typical organic compounds carbon–carbon bonds carbon–hydrogen bonds well covalent bonds carbon oxygen nitrogen
still even broadest definition carboncontaining molecules organic requires excluding alloys contain carbon including steel excluded materials compounds carbonates carbonyls simple oxides halides sulfides carbon allotropes carbon cyanides containing −c≡n functional group—all considered inorganic
definition excludes compounds historically practically considered organic neither urea oxalic acid organic definition compounds vitalism debate iupac blue book organic nomenclature specifically mentions urea5 oxalic acid6 compounds lacking bonds traditionally considered organic include benzenehexol mesoxalic acid carbon tetrachloride mellitic acid contains bonds considered possible organic substance martian soil7
bondonly rule also leads somewhat arbitrary divisions sets carbonfluorine compounds example would considered rule inorganic whereas cf3h would organic
classificationedit
main article organic chemistry classification organic compounds
organic compounds classified variety ways major distinction natural synthetic compounds organic compounds also classified subdivided presence heteroatoms organometallic compounds feature bonds carbon metal organophosphorus compounds feature bonds carbon phosphorus
another distinction based size organic compounds distinguishes small molecules polymers
natural compoundsedit
natural compounds refer produced plants animals many still extracted natural sources would expensive produce artificially examples include sugars alkaloids terpenoids certain nutrients vitamin general natural products large stereoisometrically complicated molecules present reasonable concentrations living organisms
compounds prime importance biochemistry antigens carbohydrates enzymes hormones lipids fatty acids neurotransmitters nucleic acids proteins peptides amino acids lectins vitamins fats oils
synthetic compoundsedit
compounds prepared reaction compounds known synthetic either compounds already found plants animals occur naturally
polymers category includes plastics rubbers organic synthetic semisynthetic compounds
biotechnologyedit
many organic compounds—two examples ethanol insulin—are manufactured industrially using organisms bacteria yeast typically organism altered express compounds ordinarily produced organism many biotechnologyengineered compounds previously exist nature
