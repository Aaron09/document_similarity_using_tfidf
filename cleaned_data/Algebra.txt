elementary algebra basic form algebra taught students presumed knowledge mathematics beyond basic principles arithmetic arithmetic numbers arithmetical operations occur algebra numbers often represented symbols called variables useful

allows general formulation arithmetical laws thus first step systematic exploration properties real number system
allows reference unknown numbers formulation equations study solve instance find number going find number step leads conclusion nature specific numbers allows solve operations involved
allows formulation functional relationships instance sell tickets profit dollars function number function applied
