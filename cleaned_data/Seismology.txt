scholarly interest earthquakes traced back antiquity early speculations natural causes earthquakes included writings thales miletus anaximenes miletus aristotle zhang heng
zhang heng chinas dynasty designed first known seismoscope
1664 athanasius kircher argued earthquakes caused movement fire within system channels inside earth
1703 martin lister 1638 1712 nicolas lemery 1645 1715 proposed earthquakes caused chemical explosions within earth
lisbon earthquake 1755 coinciding general flowering science europe motion intensified scientific attempts understand behaviour causation earthquakes earliest responses include work john bevis 1757 john michell 1761 michell determined earthquakes originate within earth waves movement caused shifting masses rock miles surface1
1857 robert mallet laid foundation instrumental seismology carried seismological experiments using explosives also responsible coining word seismology2
1897 emil wiecherts theoretical calculations conclude earths interior consists mantle silicates surrounding core iron3
1906 richard dixon oldham identified separate arrival pwaves swaves surface waves seismograms found first clear evidence earth central core4
1910 studying april 1906 francisco earthquake harry fielding reid forward elastic rebound theory remains foundation modern tectonic studies development theory depended considerable progress earlier independent streams work behaviour elastic materials mathematics5
1926 harold jeffreys first claim based study earthquake waves mantle core earth liquid6
1937 inge lehmann determined within earths liquid outer core solid inner core7
1960s earth science developed point comprehensive theory causation seismic events come together wellestablished theory plate tectonics

main article seismic wave




seismogram records showing three components ground motion line marks first arrival pwaves green line later arrival swaves


seismic waves elastic waves propagate solid fluid materials divided body waves travel interior materials surface waves travel along surfaces interfaces materials normal modes form standing wave
body wavesedit
types body waves pressure waves primary waves pwaves shear secondary waves swaves pwaves longitudinal waves involve compression expansion direction wave moving always first waves appear seismogram fastest moving waves solids swaves transverse waves move perpendicular direction propagation swaves slower pwaves therefore appear later pwaves seismogram fluids cannot support perpendicular motion swaves travel solids8
surface wavesedit
main surface wave types rayleigh waves compressional motion love waves rayleigh waves result interaction vertically polarized swaves satisfy boundary conditions surface love waves exist presence subsurface layer formed horizontally polarized swaves surface waves travel slowly pwaves swaves however guided earths surface energy thus trapped near surface much stronger body waves largest signals earthquake seismograms surface waves strongly excited source close surface shallow earthquake near surface explosion8
normal modesedit
also free oscillations earth
body surface waves traveling waves however large earthquakes also make earth ring like bell ringing mixture normal modes discrete frequencies periods hour shorter motion caused large earthquake observed month event8 first observations normal modes made 1960s advent higher fidelity instruments coincided largest earthquakes 20th century 1960 valdivia earthquake 1964 alaska earthquake since normal modes earth given strongest constraints deep structure earth

mapping earths interioredit
main article earths interior




seismic velocities boundaries interior earth sampled seismic waves


seismic waves commonly propagate efficiently interact internal structure earth provide highresolution noninvasive methods studying planets interior earliest important discoveries suggested richard dixon oldham 1906 definitively shown harold jeffreys 1926 outer core earth liquid since swaves pass liquids liquid core causes shadow side planet opposite earthquake direct swaves observed addition pwaves travel much slower outer core mantle
processing readings many seismometers using seismic tomography seismologists mapped mantle earth resolution several hundred kilometers enabled scientists identify convection cells largescale features large lowshearvelocity provinces near core–mantle boundary11
seismology societyedit
earthquake predictionedit
main article earthquake prediction
forecasting probable timing location magnitude important features forthcoming seismic event called earthquake prediction various attempts made seismologists others create effective systems precise earthquake predictions including method seismologists believe system provide timely warnings individual earthquakes developed many believe system would unlikely give useful warning impending seismic events however general forecasts routinely predict seismic hazard forecasts estimate probability earthquake particular size affecting particular location within particular timespan routinely used earthquake engineering
public controversy earthquake prediction erupted italian authorities indicted seismologists government official manslaughter connection magnitude earthquake laquila italy april 2009 indictment widely perceivedby indictment failing predict earthquake drawn condemnation american association advancement science american geophysical union indictment claims special meeting laquila week earthquake occurred scientists officials interested pacifying population providing adequate information earthquake risk preparedness12
