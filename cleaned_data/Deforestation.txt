public health context
deforestation eliminates great number species plants animals also often results increase disease186 loss native species allows species come dominance often destruction predatory species result increase rodent populations carry plague additionally erosion produce pools stagnant water perfect breeding grounds mosquitos well known vectors malaria yellow fever nipah virus more187 deforestation also create path nonnative species flourish certain types snails correlated increase schistosomiasis cases186188
deforestation occurring world coupled increase occurrence disease outbreaks malaysia thousands acres forest cleared farms resulted increase zoonosis nipah virus189 kenya deforestation increase malaria cases leading cause morbidity mortality country190191 2017 study american economic review found deforestation substantially increased incidence malaria nigeria192
another pathway deforestation affects disease relocation dispersion diseasecarrying hosts disease emergence pathway called “range expansion” whereby host’s range thereby range pathogens expands geographic areas193 deforestation hosts reservoir species forced neighboring habitats accompanying reservoir species pathogens ability find hosts previously unexposed regions pathogens species come closer contact humans infected directly indirectly
catastrophic example range expansion 1998 outbreak nipah virus malaysia194 number years deforestation drought subsequent fires dramatic geographic shift density fruit bats reservoir nipah virus195 deforestation reduced available fruiting trees bats’ habitat encroached surrounding orchards also happened location large number pigsties bats proximity spread nipah pigs virus infected pigs mortality much lower among humans making pigs virulent host leading transmission virus humans resulted reported cases encephalitis resulted death example provides important lesson impact deforestation human health
another example range expansion deforestation anthropogenic habitat impacts includes capybara rodent paraguay196 rodent host number zoonotic diseases humanborne outbreak movement rodent regions offers example habitat destruction deforestation subsequent movements species occurring regularly
