draw




































































black check legal move result stalemate


several ways games draw

draw agreement draws commonly reached mutual agreement players correct procedure verbally offer draw make move start opponents clock traditionally players allowed agree draw point game occasionally even without playing move recent years efforts made discourage short draws example forbidding draw offers move thirty
stalemate player whose turn move legal move check
threefold repetition position commonly occurs neither side able avoid repeating moves without incurring disadvantage situation either player claim draw requires players keep valid written record game claim verified arbiter challenged three occurrences position need occur consecutive moves claim valid fide rules make mention perpetual check merely specific type draw threefold repetition
fiftymove rule previous moves pawn moved capture made either player claim draw several known endgames possible force mate requires moves pawn move capture made examples include endgames knights pawn pawnless endgames queen bishops historically fide sometimes revised 50move rule make exceptions endgames present 2017 exceptions made correspondence chess organizations enforce fiftymove rulenote

draw time games time control game drawn player time opponent theoretical possibility checkmate player

time control




modern chess clocks


chess games also played time control players time runs game completed game automatically lost provided opponent enough pieces left deliver checkmate duration game ranges long classical games take seven hours even longer adjournments permitted bullet chess minutes player entire game intermediate rapid chess games lasting minutes hours game popular time control amateur weekend tournaments
time controlled using chess clock displays players remaining time analog chess clocks largely replaced digital clocks allow time controls increments
notation recording moves
main article chess notation


square names algebraic chess notation


chess games positions recorded using system notation commonly algebraic chess notation8 abbreviated short algebraic notation generally records moves format abbreviation piece moved file moved rank moved pieces identified initials english king queen rook bishop knight used avoid confusion king example means queen moves gfile rank square chess literature published languages different initials indicate pieces figurine algebraic notation used avoid language difficulties resolve ambiguities letter number added indicate file rank piece moved ngf3 means knight gfile moves square r1e2 means rook first rank moves letter pawn used means pawn moves square
piece makes capture inserted destination square thus bxf3 means bishop captures pawn makes capture file pawn departed used place piece initial ranks omitted unambiguous example exd5 pawn efile captures piece pawn efile captures piece somewhere dfile particularly germany publications used rather indicate capture rare publications omit capture symbol altogether exd5 would rendered simply
pawn moves last rank achieving promotion piece chosen indicated move example castling indicated special notations kingside castling queenside castling passant capture sometimes marked notation move places opponents king check usually notation added notation double check considered obsolete checkmate indicated game means white means black indicates draw9


scholars mate


chess moves annotated punctuation marks symbols example indicates good move excellent move mistake blunder interesting move best dubious move easily refuted10

fundamentals strategy
main article chess strategy
chess strategy concerned evaluation chess positions setting goals longterm plans future play evaluation players must take account numerous factors value pieces board control center centralization pawn structure king safety control squares groups squares example diagonals open files dark light squares
basic step evaluating position count total value pieces sides15 point values used purpose based experience usually pawns considered worth point knights bishops three points rooks five points value difference rook bishop knight known exchange queens nine points king valuable pieces combined since checkmate loses game practical terms endgame king fighting piece generally powerful bishop knight less powerful rook16 basic values modified factors like position piece advanced pawns usually valuable initial squares coordination pieces pair bishops usually coordinate better bishop knight type position knights generally better closed positions many pawns bishops powerful open positions17

pawn rauzer formation





another important factor evaluation chess positions pawn structure sometimes known pawn skeleton configuration pawns chessboard19 since pawns least mobile chess pieces pawn structure relatively static largely determines strategic nature position weaknesses pawn structure isolated doubled backward pawns holes created often permanent care must therefore taken avoid weaknesses unless compensated another valuable asset example possibility developing attack20

phases
opening
main article chess opening
chess opening group initial moves game opening moves recognized sequences opening moves referred openings given names lopez sicilian defense catalogued reference works encyclopaedia chess openings dozens different openings varying widely character quiet positional play example réti opening aggressive latvian gambit opening lines exact sequence considered best sides worked moves21 professional players spend years studying openings continue throughout careers opening theory continues evolve
fundamental strategic aims openings similar22

development technique placing pieces particularly bishops knights useful squares optimal impact game
control center control central squares allows pieces moved part board relatively easily also cramping effect opponent
king safety critical keep king safe dangerous possibilities correctly timed castling often enhance
pawn structure players strive avoid creation pawn weaknesses isolated doubled backward pawns pawn islands force weaknesses opponents position

players theoreticians consider white virtue first move begins game small advantage initially gives white initiative23 black usually strives neutralize whites advantage achieve equality develop dynamic counterplay unbalanced position
middlegame
main article chess middlegame
middlegame part game starts opening clear line opening middlegame typically middlegame start pieces developed similarly clear transition middlegame endgame start endgame opening theory ended players form plans based features position time take account tactical possibilities position24 middlegame phase combinations occur combinations series tactical moves executed achieve gain middlegame combinations often connected attack opponents king typical patterns names example bodens mate lasker–bauer combination25
specific plans strategic themes often arise particular groups openings result specific type pawn structure example minority attack attack queenside pawns opponent pawns queenside study openings therefore connected preparation plans typical resulting middlegames26
another important strategic question middlegame whether reduce material transition endgame simplify minor material advantages generally transformed victory endgame therefore stronger side must choose appropriate achieve ending every reduction material good purpose example side keeps lightsquared bishop opponent darksquared transformation bishops pawns ending usually advantageous weaker side endgame bishops opposite colors likely draw even advantage pawn sometimes even twopawn advantage27
endgame
main article chess endgame

example zugzwang


































































side move disadvantage


endgame also game ending stage game pieces left board three main strategic differences earlier stages game endgame28

pawns become important endgames often revolve around endeavors promote pawn advancing furthest rank
king required safeguarding checkmate middlegame emerges strong piece endgame often brought center board protect pawns attack enemy pawns hinder moves opponents king
zugzwang disadvantageous since forces player move often factor endgames rarely stages game example diagram either side move zugzwang black move must play 1kb7 allowing white promote pawn 2kd7 white move must permit draw either 1kc6 stalemate losing pawn legal move

endgames classified according type pieces remaining board basic checkmates positions side king side pieces checkmate opposing king pieces working together king example king pawn endgames involve kings pawns sides task stronger side promote pawns complicated endings classified according pieces board kings rook pawn versus rook endgames
