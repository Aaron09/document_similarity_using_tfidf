trials drugsedit
clinical trials involve healthy subjects preexisting medical conditions clinical trials pertain patients specific health conditions willing experimental treatment
participants healthy volunteers receive financial incentives goals different participants sick dosing periods study subjects typically remain supervision nights
usually pilot experiments conducted gain insights design clinical trial follow
goals testing medical treatments learn whether work well enough called efficacy effectiveness learn whether safe enough called safety neither absolute criterion safety efficacy evaluated relative treatment intended used treatments available severity disease condition benefits must outweigh risks458 example many drugs treat cancer severe side effects would acceptable overthecounter pain medication cancer drugs approved since used physicians care used lifethreatening condition6
elderly constitute percent population consume onethird drugs7 people similar cutoff often excluded trials greater health issues drug complicate data interpretation different physiological capacity younger people women children people unrelated medical conditions also frequently excluded8 women major reason exclusion possibility pregnancy unknown risks fetus
sponsor designs trial coordination panel expert clinical investigators including alternative existing treatments compare drug types patients might benefit sponsor cannot obtain enough test subjects location investigators locations recruited join study
trial investigators recruit subjects predetermined characteristics administer treatments collect data subjects health defined time period data include measurements vital signs concentration study drug blood tissues changes symptoms whether improvement worsening condition targeted study drug occurs researchers send data trial sponsor analyzes pooled data using statistical tests
examples clinical trial goals include assessing safety relative effectiveness medication device

specific kind patient example patient diagnosed alzheimers disease
varying dosages example milligram dose instead milligram dose
indication
evaluation improved efficacy treating patients condition compared standard therapy condition
evaluation study drug device relative already approvedcommon interventions condition example device versus device therapy versus therapy

clinical trials test alternative novel intervention expand three four include placebo
except small singlelocation trials design objectives specified document called clinical trial protocol protocol trials operating manual ensures researchers perform trial similar subjects data comparable across subjects
trial designed test hypotheses rigorously monitor assess outcomes seen application scientific method specifically experimental step
common clinical trials evaluate pharmaceutical products medical devices catheter biologics psychological therapies interventions clinical trials required national regulatory authority9 approves marketing innovation

austin bradford hill pivotal figure modern development clinical trials


ronald fisher working rothamsted experimental station field agriculture developed principles experimental design 1920s accurate methodology proper design experiments among major ideas importance randomization random assignment individuals different groups experiment24 replication reduce uncertainty measurements repeated experiments replicated identify sources variation25 blocking arrange experimental units groups units similar thus reducing irrelevant sources variation factorial experiments efficient evaluating effects possible interactions several independent factors15
british medical research council officially recognized importance clinical trials 1930s council established therapeutic trials committee advise assist arrangement properly controlled clinical trials products seem likely experimental grounds value treatment disease15
first randomised curative trial carried tuberculosis research unit geoffrey marshall 1887–1982 trial carried 1946–1947 aimed test efficacy chemical streptomycin curing pulmonary tuberculosis trial doubleblind placebocontrolled26
methodology clinical trials developed austin bradford hill involved streptomycin trials 1920s hill applied statistics medicine attending lectures renowned mathematician karl pearson amongst others became famous landmark study carried collaboration richard doll correlation smoking lung cancer carried casecontrol study 1950 compared lung cancer patients matched control also began sustained longterm prospective study broader issue smoking health involved studying smoking habits health 30000 doctors period several years certificate election royal society called leader development medicine precise experimental methods used nationally internationally evaluation therapeutic prophylactic agents

typesedit
classifying clinical trials researchers behave

observational study investigators observe subjects measure outcomes researchers actively manage study
interventional study investigators give research subjects particular medicine intervention compare treated subjects receiving treatment standard treatment researchers measure subjects health changes

another classifying trials purpose national institutes health organizes trials five different types28

prevention trials look better ways prevent disease people never disease prevent disease returning approaches include medicines vitamins vaccines lifestyle changes
screening trials test best detect certain diseases health conditions
diagnostic trials conducted find better tests procedures diagnosing particular disease condition
treatment trials test experimental treatments combinations drugs approaches surgery radiation therapy
quality life trials supportive care trials explore ways improve comfort quality life individuals chronic illness
compassionate trials expanded access trials provide partially tested unapproved therapeutics small number patients realistic options usually involves disease effective therapy approved patient already failed standard treatments whose health compromised qualify participation randomized clinical trials29 usually casebycase approval must granted united states food drug administration pharmaceutical company exceptions

third classification whether trial design allows changes based data accumulated trial

fixed trials consider existing data trials design modify trial begins assess results study complete
adaptive clinical trials existing data design trial interim results modify trial proceeds modifications include dosage sample size drug undergoing trial patient selection criteria cocktail mix30 adaptive trials often employ bayesian experimental design assess trials progress cases trials become ongoing process regularly adds drops therapies patient groups information gained31 quickly identify drugs therapeutic effect zero patient populations drug appropriate3233

finally common distinguishing trials phase simple terms relates close drug clinically proven effective stated purpose accepted regulatory authorities purpose
phasesedit
main article phases clinical research
clinical trials involving drugs commonly classified five phases phase drug approval process treated separate clinical trial drugdevelopment process normally proceed four phases many years drug successfully passes phases usually approved national regulatory authority general population pharmaceutical companies start clinical trials drug also conducted extensive preclinical studies phase different purpose helps scientists answer different question

trial designedit
main article clinical study design
fundamental distinction evidencebased practice observational studies randomized controlled trials35 types observational studies epidemiology cohort study casecontrol study provide less compelling evidence randomized controlled trial35 observational studies investigators retrospectively assess associations treatments given participants health status potential considerable errors design interpretation36
randomized controlled trial provide compelling evidence study treatment causes effect human health35
currently phase phase drug trials designed randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled

randomized study subject randomly assigned receive either study treatment placebo
blind subjects involved study know study treatment receive study doubleblind researchers also know treatment subject receives intent prevent researchers treating groups differently form doubleblind study called doubledummy design allows additional insurance bias kind study patients given placebo active doses alternating periods
placebocontrolled placebo fake treatment allows researchers isolate effect study treatment placebo effect

clinical studies small numbers subjects sponsored single researchers small group researchers designed test simple questions feasibility expand research comprehensive randomized controlled trial37

clinical trial protocoledit
main article clinical trial protocol
clinical trial protocol document used define manage trial prepared panel experts study investigators expected strictly observe protocol
protocol describes scientific rationale objectives design methodology statistical considerations organization planned trial details trial provided documents referenced protocol investigators brochure
protocol contains precise study plan assure safety health trial subjects provide exact template trial conduct investigators allows data combined across investigatorssites protocol also informs study administrators often contract research organization
format content clinical trial protocols sponsored pharmaceutical biotechnology medical device companies united states european union japan standardized follow good clinical practice guidance40 issued international conference harmonization technical requirements registration pharmaceuticals human ich41 regulatory authorities canada australia also follow guidelines journals trials encourage investigators publish protocols
design featuresedit
informed consentedit




example informed consent document paramount trial


clinical trials recruit study subjects sign document representing informed consent42 document includes details purpose duration required procedures risks potential benefits contacts institutional requirements43 participant decides whether sign document document contract participant withdraw time without penalty
informed consent legal process recruit instructed facts deciding whether participate researchers explain details study terms subject understand information presented subjects native language generally children cannot autonomously provide informed consent depending factors required provide informed assent
statistical poweredit

number subjects large impact ability reliably detect measure effects intervention described power larger number participants greater statistical power greater cost
statistical power estimates ability trial detect difference particular size larger treatment control groups example trial lipidlowering drug versus placebo patients group might power detect difference placebo trial groups receiving dosage mgdl detect difference mgdl
placebo groupsedit
main article placebocontrolled studies
merely giving treatment nonspecific effects controlled inclusion patients receive placebo subjects assigned randomly without informing group belonged many trials doubledblinded researchers know group subject assigned
assigning subject placebo group pose ethical problem violates right receive best available treatment declaration helsinki provides guidelines issue

timeline various approval tracks research phases



clinical trials small part research goes developing treatment potential drugs example first discovered purified characterized tested labs cell animal studies ever undergoing clinical trials 1000 potential drugs tested reaches point tested clinical trialcitation needed example cancer drug average years research behind even makes clinical trials major holdup making cancer drugs available time takes complete clinical trials average eight years pass time cancer drug enters clinical trials receives approval regulatory agencies sale public44 drugs diseases similar timelines
reasons clinical trial might last several years

chronic conditions cancer takes months years cancer treatment effect patient
drugs expected strong effect meaning large number patients must recruited observe effect recruiting enough patients test drugs effectiveness getting statistical power take several years
certain people target disease condition eligible take part clinical trial researchers treat particular patients must participate trial must identify desirable patients obtain consent families take part trial

biggest barrier completing studies shortage people take part drug many device trials target subset population meaning everyone participate drug trials require patients unusual combinations disease characteristics challenge find appropriate patients obtain consent especially receive direct benefit paid study drug proven work patient receive placebo case cancer patients fewer adults cancer participate drug trials according pharmaceutical research manufacturers america phrma cancer medicines tested clinical trials 2005 prove useful delayed getting approved number participants low45
