contrast medianedit
arithmetic mean contrasted median median defined half values larger half smaller median elements sample data increase arithmetically placed order median arithmetic average equal example consider data sample

comparison mean median mode lognormal distributions different skewness


population numbers sample data could take continuous range numbers instead example integers probability number falling range possible values could differ probability falling different range possible values even lengths ranges case probabilities described using continuous probability distribution analog weighted average context infinitude possibilities precise value variable called mean probability distribution widely encountered probability distribution called normal distribution property measures central tendency including mean also aforementioned median mode equal property hold however cases great many probability distributions lognormal distribution illustrated
anglesedit
main article mean circular quantities
particular care must taken using cyclic data phases angles naïvely taking arithmetic mean 359° yields result 180° incorrect reasons

firstly angle measurements defined additive constant 360° measuring radians thus could easily call 361° 719° gives different average
secondly situation equivalently 360° geometrically better average value lower dispersion points 179° 180° putative average

general application oversight lead average value artificially moving towards middle numerical range solution problem optimization formulation define mean central point point lowest dispersion redefine difference modular distance distance circle modular distance 359° 358°
