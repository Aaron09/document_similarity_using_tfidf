biology spore unit sexual asexual reproduction adapted dispersal survival often extended periods time unfavourable conditions spores form part life cycles many plants algae fungi protozoa1 bacterial spores part sexual cycle resistant structures used survival unfavourable conditions myxozoan spores release amoebulae hosts parasitic infection also reproduce within hosts pairing nuclei within plasmodium develops amoebula2
spores usually haploid unicellular produced meiosis sporangium diploid sporophyte favourable conditions spore develop organism using mitotic division producing multicellular gametophyte eventually goes produce gametes gametes fuse form zygote develops sporophyte cycle known alternation generations
spores seed plants however produced internally megaspores formed within ovules microspores involved formation complex structures form dispersal units seeds pollen grains

definitionedit
term spore derives ancient greek word σπορά spora meaning seed sowing related σπόρος sporos sowing σπείρειν speirein
common parlance difference spore gamete together called gonites spore germinate develop sporeling gamete needs combine another gamete form zygote developing
main difference spores seeds dispersal units spores unicellular seeds contain within multicellular gametophyte produces developing embryo multicellular sporophyte next generation spores germinate give rise haploid gametophytes seeds germinate give rise diploid sporophytes
classification sporeproducing organismsedit
vascular plant spores always haploid vascular plants either homosporous isosporous heterosporous plants homosporous produce spores size type
heterosporous plants seed plants spikemosses quillworts ferns order salviniales produce spores different sizes larger spore megaspore effect functioning female spore smaller microspore functioning male plants typically give rise kind spores within separate sporangium either megasporangium produces megaspores microsporangium produces microspores flowering plants sporangia occur within carpel anthers respectively
classification sporesedit
spores classified several ways
sporeproducing structureedit




asci morchella elata containing ascospores






plants microspores cases megaspores formed four products meiosis






contrast many seed plants heterosporous ferns single product meiosis become megaspore macrospore rest degenerating


fungi funguslike organisms spores often classified structure meiosis spore production occurs since fungi often classified according sporeproducing structures spores often characteristic particular taxon fungi

sporangiospores spores produced sporangium many fungi zygomycetes
zygospores spores produced zygosporangium characteristic zygomycetes
ascospores spores produced ascus characteristic ascomycetes
basidiospores spores produced basidium characteristic basidiomycetes
aeciospores spores produced aecium fungi rusts smuts
urediniospores spores produced uredinium fungi rusts smuts
teliospores spores produced telium fungi rusts smuts
oospores spores produced oogonium characteristic oomycetes
carpospores spores produced carposporophyte characteristic algae
tetraspores spores produced tetrasporophyte characteristic algae

functionedit

chlamydospores thickwalled resting spores fungi produced survive unfavorable conditions
parasitic fungal spores classified internal spores germinate within host external spores also called environmental spores released host infest hosts3

origin life cycleedit

meiospores spores produced meiosis thus haploid give rise haploid daughter cells haploid individual examples precursor cells gametophytes seed plants found flowers angiosperms cones gymnosperms zoospores produced meiosis sporophytes algae ulva

microspores meiospores give rise male gametophyte pollen seed plants
megaspores macrospores meiospores give rise female gametophyte seed plants gametophyte forms within ovule


mitospores conidia conidiospores spores produced mitosis characteristic ascomycetes fungi mitospores found called mitosporic fungi anamorphic fungi previously classified taxon deuteromycota teleomorph anamorph holomorph

mobilityedit
spores differentiated whether move

zoospores mobile spores move means flagella found algae fungi
aplanospores immobile spores nevertheless potentially grow flagella
autospores immobile spores cannot develop flagella
ballistospores spores forcibly discharged ejected fungal fruiting body result internal force buildup pressure basidiospores also ballistospores another notable example spores genus pilobolus
statismospores spores discharged fungal fruiting body result external force raindrops passing animal examples puffballs

anatomyedit
high magnification spores categorized either monolete spores trilete spores monolete spores single line spore indicating axis mother spore split four along vertical axis trilete spores four spores share common origin contact separate spore shows three lines radiating center pole

spores ejected fungi


fungi asexual sexual spores sporangiospores many fungal species actively dispersed forcible ejection reproductive structures ejection ensures exit spores reproductive structures well travelling long distances many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical physiological mechanisms well sporesurface structures hydrophobins spore ejection mechanisms include example forcible discharge ascospores enabled structure ascus accumulation osmolytes fluids ascus lead explosive discharge ascospores air7
forcible discharge single spores termed ballistospores involves formation small drop water bullers drop upon contact spore leads projectile release initial acceleration 10000 fungi rely alternative mechanisms spore release external mechanical forces exemplified puffballs attracting insects flies fruiting structures virtue lively colours putrid odour dispersal fungal spores another strategy prominently used stinkhorns
common smoothcap moss atrichum undulatum vibration sporophyte shown important mechanism spore release9
