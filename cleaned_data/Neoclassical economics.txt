overviewedit
term originally introduced thorstein veblen 1900 article preconceptions economic science related marginalists tradition alfred marshall austrian school34

attempt made even pass verdict relative claims recognized three main schools theory beyond somewhat obvious finding purpose hand socalled austrian school scarcely distinguishable neoclassical unless different distribution emphasis divergence modernized classical views hand historical marxist schools hand wider much indeed consideration postulates latter head inquiry former veblen5

later used john hicks george stigler others6 include work carl menger william stanley jevons léon walras john bates clark many others3 today usually used refer mainstream economics although also used umbrella term encompassing number schools thought7 notably excluding institutional economics various historical schools economics marxian economics addition various heterodox approaches economics
neoclassical economics characterized several assumptions common many schools economic thought complete agreement meant neoclassical economics result wide range neoclassical approaches various problem areas domains—ranging neoclassical theories labor neoclassical theories demographic changes
three central assumptionsedit
expressed weintraub neoclassical economics rests three assumptions although certain branches neoclassical theory different approaches8

people rational preferences outcomes identified associated values
individuals maximize utility firms maximize profits
people independently basis full relevant information

three assumptions neoclassical economists built structure understand allocation scarce resources among alternative ends—in fact understanding allocation often considered definition economics neoclassical theorists heres william stanley jevons presented problem economics

given certain population various needs powers production possession certain lands sources material required mode employing labour maximize utility produce9

basic assumptions neoclassical economics comes wide range theories various areas economic activity example profit maximization lies behind neoclassical theory firm derivation demand curves leads understanding consumer goods supply curve allows analysis factors production utility maximization source neoclassical theory consumption derivation demand curves consumer goods derivation labor supply curves reservation demand10
market supply demand aggregated across firms individuals interactions determine equilibrium output price market supply demand factor production derived analogously market final output determine equilibrium income income distribution factor demand incorporates marginalproductivity relationship factor output market6111213
neoclassical economics emphasizes equilibria equilibria solutions agent maximization problems regularities economies explained methodological individualism position economic phenomena explained aggregating behavior agents emphasis microeconomics institutions might considered prior conditioning individual behavior deemphasized economic subjectivism accompanies emphases also general equilibrium

classical economics developed 18th 19th centuries included value theory distribution theory value product thought depend costs involved producing product explanation costs classical economics simultaneously explanation distribution landlord received rent workers received wages capitalist tenant farmer received profits investment classic approach included work adam smith david ricardo
however economists gradually began emphasizing perceived value good consumer proposed theory value product explained differences utility usefulness consumer england economists tended conceptualize utility keeping utilitarianism jeremy bentham later john stuart mill
third step political economy economics introduction marginalism proposition economic actors made decisions based margins example person decides second sandwich based full first firm hires employee based expected increase profits employee bring differs aggregate decision making classical political economy explains vital goods water cheap luxuries expensive
marginal revolutionedit
change economic theory classical neoclassical economics called marginal revolution although argued process slower term suggests14 frequently dated william stanley jevonss theory political economy 1871 carl mengers principles economics 1871 léon walrass elements pure economics 1874–1877 historians economics economists debated

whether utility marginalism essential revolution whether noun adjective phrase marginal utility important
whether revolutionary change thought merely gradual development change emphasis predecessors
whether grouping economists together disguises differences important similarities15

particular jevons economics application development jeremy benthams utilitarianism never fully developed general equilibrium theory menger embrace hedonic conception explained diminishing marginal utility terms subjective prioritization possible uses emphasized disequilibrium discrete menger objection mathematics economics modeled theories 19th century mechanics16 jevons built hedonic conception bentham mill walras interested interaction markets explaining individual psyche15
alfred marshalls textbook principles economics 1890 dominant textbook england generation later marshalls influence extended elsewhere italians would compliment maffeo pantaleoni calling marshall italy marshall thought classical economics attempted explain prices cost production asserted earlier marginalists went correcting imbalance overemphasizing utility demand marshall thought might reasonably dispute whether upper blade pair scissors cuts piece paper whether value governed utility cost production
marshall explained price intersection supply demand curves introduction different market periods important innovation marshall’s

market period goods produced sale market taken given data fish market prices quickly adjust clear markets
short period industrial capacity taken given level output level employment inputs materials prices fluctuate equate marginal cost marginal revenue profits maximized economic rents exist short period equilibrium fixed factors rate profit equated across sectors
long period stock capital goods factories machines taken given profitmaximizing equilibria determine industrial capacity level operated
long period technology population trends habits customs taken given allowed vary long period models

marshall took supply demand stable functions extended supply demand explanations prices runs argued supply easier vary longer runs thus became important determinant price long
developmentsedit
important change neoclassical economics occurred around 1933 joan robinson edward chamberlin near simultaneous publication respective books economics imperfect competition 1933 theory monopolistic competition 1933 introduced models imperfect competition theories market forms industrial organization grew work also emphasized certain tools marginal revenue curve
joan robinsons work imperfect competition least response certain problems marshallian partial equilibrium theory highlighted piero sraffa angloamerican economists also responded problems turning towards general equilibrium theory developed european continent walras vilfredo pareto hickss value capital 1939 influential introducing englishspeaking colleagues traditions turn influenced austrian school economist friedrich hayeks move london school economics hicks studied
developments accompanied introduction tools indifference curves theory ordinal utility level mathematical sophistication neoclassical economics increased paul samuelsons foundations economic analysis 1947 contributed increase mathematical modelling
interwar period american economics argued pluralistic neoclassical economics institutionalism competing allegiance frank knight early chicago school economist attempted combine schools increase mathematics accompanied greater dominance neoclassical economics angloamerican universities world some17 argue outside political interventions mccarthyism internal ideological bullying played important role rise dominance
hicks book value capital main parts second arguably immediately influential presented model temporary equilibrium hicks influenced directly hayeks notion intertemporal coordination paralleled earlier work lindhal part abandonment disaggregated long models trend probably reached culmination arrow–debreu model intertemporal equilibrium arrowdebreu model canonical presentations gérard debreus theory value 1959 arrow hahns general competitive analysis 1971
many developments backdrop improvements econometrics ability measure prices changes goods services well aggregate quantities creation macroeconomics study whole economies attempt combine neoclassical microeconomics keynesian macroeconomics would lead neoclassical synthesis18 dominant paradigm economic reasoning englishspeaking countries since 1950s hicks samuelson example instrumental mainstreaming keynesian economics

criticismsedit

main article criticisms neoclassical economics
neoclassical economics sometimes criticized normative bias view focus explaining actual economies instead describing theoretical world pareto optimality applies19
perhaps strongest criticism lies disregard physical limits earth ecosphere physical container human economies disregard becomes denial neoclassical economists limits asserted since accept limits creates fundamental contradictions foundational presumptions growth scale human economy forever possible desirable disregarddenial limits includes resources waste sinks capacity absorb human waste products manmade toxins20
assumption individuals rationally viewed ignoring important aspects human behavior many economic quite different real people many economists even contemporaries criticized model economic thorstein veblen sardonically neoclassical economics assumes person

lightning calculator pleasures pains oscillates like homogeneous globule desire happiness impulse stimuli shift area leave intact21

large corporations might perhaps come closer neoclassical ideal profit maximization necessarily viewed desirable comes expense neglect wider social issues22
problems exist making neoclassical general equilibrium theory compatible economy develops time includes capital goods explored major debate 1960s—the cambridge capital controversy—about validity neoclassical economics emphasis economic growth capital aggregate theory marginal productivity theory distribution also internal attempts neoclassical economists extend arrowdebreu model disequilibrium investigations stability uniqueness however result known sonnenschein–mantel–debreu theorem suggests assumptions must made ensure equilibrium stable unique quite restrictive
neoclassical economics also often seen relying heavily complex mathematical models used general equilibrium theory without enough regard whether actually describe real economy many attempt model system complex modern economy mathematical model unrealistic doomed failure famous answer criticism milton friedmans claim theories judged ability predict events rather realism assumptions23 mathematical models also include game theory linear programming econometrics some24 mathematical models used contemporary research mainstream economics transcended neoclassical economics others25 disagree critics neoclassical economics divided think highly mathematical method inherently wrong think mathematical method potentially good even contemporary methods problems26
general allegedly overly unrealistic assumptions common criticisms towards neoclassical economics fair many criticisms directed towards subset neoclassical models example many neoclassical models unregulated markets fail achieve paretooptimality recently increased interest modeling nonrational decision makingcitation needed disregard social reality alleged role aiding elites widen wealth social inequality also frequently criticized
