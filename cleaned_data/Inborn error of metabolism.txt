classificationedit
traditionally inherited metabolic diseases classified disorders carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism organic acid metabolism lysosomal storage diseases recent decades hundreds inherited disorders metabolism discovered categories proliferated following major classes congenital metabolic diseases prominent examples class many others fall categoriescitation needed

signs symptomsedit
enormous number diseases wide range systems affected nearly every presenting complaint doctor congenital metabolic disease possible cause especially childhood following examples potential manifestations affecting major organ systems


growth failure failure thrive weight loss
ambiguous genitalia delayed puberty precocious puberty
developmental delay seizures dementia encephalopathy stroke
deafness blindness pain agnosia
skin rash abnormal pigmentation lack pigmentation excessive hair growth lumps bumps
dental abnormalities
immunodeficiency platelet count blood cell count enlarged spleen enlarged lymph nodes
many forms cancer
recurrent vomiting diarrhea abdominal pain
excessive urination kidney failure dehydration edema
blood pressure heart failure enlarged heart hypertension myocardial infarction
liver enlargement jaundice liver failure
unusual facial features congenital malformations
excessive breathing hyperventilation respiratory failure
abnormal behavior depression psychosis
joint pain muscle weakness cramps
hypothyroidism adrenal insufficiency hypogonadism diabetes mellitus


diagnosisedit
dozens congenital metabolic diseases detectable newborn screening tests especially expanded testing using mass spectrometry increasingly common diagnosis made sometimes results earlier treatment better outcome revolutionary chromatography–mass spectrometrybased technology integrated analytics system made possible test newborn genetic metabolic disorders
multiplicity conditions many different diagnostic tests used screening abnormal result often followed subsequent definitive test confirm suspected diagnosis




chromatography–mass spectrometry gcms


common screening tests used last sixty years

ferric chloride test turned colors reaction various abnormal metabolites urine
ninhydrin paper chromatography detected abnormal amino acid patterns
guthrie bacterial inhibition assay detected amino acids excessive amounts blood dried blood spot used multianalyte testing using tandem mass spectrometry msms given indication disorder confirmed enzyme assays iexninhydrin gcms testing
quantitative measurement amino acids plasma urine
iexninhydrin post column derivitization liquid ionexchange chromatography detected abnormal amino acid patterns quantitative analysis
urine organic acid analysis chromatography–mass spectrometry
plasma acylcarnitines analysis mass spectrometry
urine purines pyrimidines analysis chromatographymass spectrometry

specific diagnostic tests focused screening small disorders

tissue biopsy necropsy liver muscle brain bone marrow
skin biopsy fibroblast cultivation specific enzyme testing
specific testing

2015 review reported even diagnostic tests cases biochemical testing gene sequencing enzymatic testing neither confirm rule resulting need rely patients clinical course3
treatmentedit
middle 20th century principal treatment amino acid disorders restriction dietary protein care simply management complications past twenty years enzyme replacement gene therapy organ transplantation become available beneficial many previously untreatable disorders common promising therapies listed


dietary restriction

reduction dietary protein remains mainstay treatment phenylketonuria amino acid disorders


dietary supplementation replacement

oral ingestion cornstarch several times helps prevent people glycogen storage diseases becoming seriously hypoglycemic


vitamins

thiamine supplementation benefits several types disorders cause lactic acidosis


intermediary metabolites compounds drugs facilitate retard specific metabolic pathways
dialysis
enzyme replacement acidalpha glucosidase pompe disease
gene therapy
bone marrow organ transplantation
treatment symptoms complications
prenatal diagnosis
