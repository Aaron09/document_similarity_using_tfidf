difficulties definitionedit
term phenotype sometimes incorrectly used shorthand phenotypic difference wild type bringing absurd statement mutation phenotype4
despite seemingly straightforward definition concept phenotype hidden subtleties seem anything dependent genotype phenotype including molecules proteins molecules structures coded genetic material visible appearance organism observable example western blotting thus part phenotype human blood groups example seem goes beyond original intentions concept focus living organism either term phenotype includes traits characteristics made visible technical procedure notable extension idea presence organic molecules metabolites generated organisms chemical reactions enzymes
another extension adds behavior phenotype since behaviors observable characteristics behavioral phenotypes include cognitive personality behavioral patterns behavioral phenotypes characterize psychiatric disorders5 syndromes67

phenotypic variationedit
phenotypic variation underlying heritable genetic variation fundamental prerequisite evolution natural selection living organism whole contributes next generation natural selection affects genetic structure population indirectly contribution phenotypes without phenotypic variation would evolution natural selection8
interaction genotype phenotype often conceptualized following relationship

genotype environment phenotype

nuanced version relationship

genotype environment genotype environment interactions phenotype

genotypes often much flexibility modification expression phenotypes many organisms phenotypes different varying environmental conditions ecophenotypic variation plant hieracium umbellatum found growing different habitats sweden habitat rocky seaside cliffs plants bushy broad leaves expanded inflorescences among sand dunes plants grow prostrate narrow leaves compact inflorescences habitats alternate along coast sweden habitat seeds hieracium umbellatum land determine phenotype grows9
example random variation drosophila flies number ommatidia vary randomly left right eyes single individual much different genotypes overall clones raised different environments
concept phenotype extended variations level gene affect organisms fitness example silent mutations change corresponding amino acid sequence gene change frequency guaninecytosine base pairs content base pairs higher thermal stability melting point adeninethymine property might convey among organisms living hightemperature environments selective advantage variants enriched content
extended phenotypeedit
main article extended phenotype
term extended phenotype refers idea phenotype restricted biological processes includes effects gene surroundings concept generalized richard dawkins explains phenotype includes influence gene environment organisms begin understand concept extended phenotype central theorem extended phenotype animals behavior tends maximize survival genes behavior whether genes happen body particular animal performing
three types extended phenotypes first describes organism using architectural constructions modify environment living common example given dawkins beaver instance beaver might considered phenotype beaver genes beavers powerful incisor teeth phenotypic expressions genes beaver uses incisors modify environment influence gene environment example extended phenotype
dawkins cites effect organism behavior another organism devoted nurturing cuckoo parent different species example extended phenotype well parasites living inside body host first example used sporocysts flukes genus leucochloridium invade tentacles snails seen conspicuously pulsating snails skin change color behavior infected snails move upwards vegetation increases suggested predation snail thereby assists parasites entry final host bird
third example extended phenotype action distance genes organism affect behavior another organism examples dawkins used genes orchids affecting orchid behavior increase pollination genes rattlesnakes causing avoidance behavior animals genes male peacocks affecting copulatory decisions peahens
smallest unit replicators gene replicators cannot directly selected upon selected phenotypic effects effects packaged together organisms think replicator extended phenotypic effects ways affects world effects replicators body reside10
phenome phenomicsedit
confused phoneme phonology
although phenotype ensemble observable characteristics displayed organism word phenome sometimes used refer collection traits simultaneous study collection referred phenomics1112 phenomics important field study used figure genomic variants affect phenotypes used explain things like health disease evolutionary fitness13 phenomics forms large part human genome project14
phenomics widespread applications agricultural industry exponentially growing population inconsistent weather patterns global warming become increasingly difficult cultivate enough crops support world’s population advantageous genomic variations like drought heat resistance identified phenomics create durable gmos1516
phenomics also crucial stepping stone towards personalized medicine particularly drug therapy application phenomics greatest potential avoid testing drug therapies prove ineffective unsafe17 phenomic database acquired data patient phenomic information used select specific drugs tailored patient regulation phenomics develops potential knowledge bases help achieve promise personalized medicine treatment neuropsychiatric syndromes
