global climateedit
also greenhouse effect
humidity affects energy budget thereby influences temperatures major ways first water vapor atmosphere contains latent energy transpiration evaporation latent heat removed surface liquid cooling earths surface biggest nonradiative cooling effect surface compensates roughly average radiative warming surface
second water vapor abundant greenhouse gases water vapor like green lens allows green light pass absorbs light selective absorber along greenhouse gases water vapor transparent solar energy literally absorbs infrared energy emitted radiated upward earths surface reason humid areas experience little nocturnal cooling desert regions cool considerably night selective absorption causes greenhouse effect raises surface temperature substantially theoretical radiative equilibrium temperature water vapor cause warming greenhouse
unlike greenhouse gases however water merely boiling point regions earth freezing point many altitudes condensible greenhouse precipitates much lower scale height shorter atmospheric lifetime weeks instead decades without greenhouse gases earths blackbody temperature freezing point water would cause water vapor removed atmosphere202122 water vapor thus slave noncondensible greenhouse gases232425
density volumeedit
main articles volume thermodynamics density
humidity depends water vaporization condensation turn mainly depends temperature therefore applying pressure saturated water components initially decrease volume approximately according ideal however water condense returning almost humidity giving resulting total volume deviating ideal predicted conversely decreasing temperature would also make water condense making final volume deviate predicted ideal therefore volume alternatively expressed volume excluding humidity content fraction accurately follows ideal contrary saturated volume volume mixture would humidity added saturation relative humidity
humid less dense molecule water less massive either molecule nitrogen molecule oxygen molecules nitrogen another molecules oxygen final mixture gases
given temperature pressure number molecules present particular volume constant ideal water molecules vapor introduced volume number molecules volume must decrease number temperature pressure remain constant addition water molecules molecules without removal equal number molecules necessarily require change temperature pressure total volume change least three parameters temperature pressure remain constant volume increases molecules displaced initially move additional volume mixture eventually become uniform diffusion hence mass unit volume gas—its density—decreases isaac newton discovered phenomenon wrote book opticks26
