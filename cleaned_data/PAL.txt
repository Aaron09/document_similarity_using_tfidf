historyedit
1950s western european countries commenced planning introduce colour television faced problem ntsc standard demonstrated several weaknesses including colour tone shifting poor transmission conditions became major issue considering europes geographical weatherrelated particularities overcome ntscs shortcomings alternative standards devised resulting development secam standards goal provide colour standard european picture frequency fields second hertz finding eliminate problems ntsc

usually visible lines compared lines ntsc meaning higher resolution fact even higher resolution enhanced definition standard 854x480citation needed output ntsc interlaced frames meaning even lines update field lines update next field interlacing frames gives smoother motion half frame rate ntsc used frame rate whereas generally uses high enough frame rate give illusion fluid motion fact ntsc generally used countries utility frequency countries although many exceptions ntsc higher frame rate film uses frames second closer frame rate film films sped play systems shortening runtime film without adjustment slightly raising pitch audio track film conversions ntsc instead pull spread frames film across interlaced fields maintains runtime film preserves original audio cause worse interlacing artifacts fast motion
ntsc receivers tint control perform colour correction manually adjusted correctly colours faulty standard automatically cancels errors phase reversal tint control unnecessary saturation control useful chrominance phase errors system cancelled using delay line resulting lower saturation much less noticeable ntsc errors
however alternation colour information—hanover bars—can lead picture grain pictures extreme phase errors even systems decoder circuits misaligned simplified decoders early designs typically overcome royalty restrictions cases extreme phase shifts occur effect usually observed transmission path poor typically built areas terrain unfavourable effect noticeable signals signals tend robust
early 1970s japanese manufacturers developed decoding systems avoid paying royalties telefunken telefunken license covered decoding method relied alternating subcarrier phase reduce phase errors included basic decoders relied human average oddeven line phase errors solution analog delay line allow decoding even lines example chrominance lines would switched directly decoder also stored delay line even lines stored line would decoded method effectively converted ntsc systems suffered errors problems inherent ntsc required addition manual control
ntsc slightly divergent colour spaces colour decoder differences ignored
secamedit
secam patents predate several years 1956 1962 creator henri france search response known ntsc problems came ideas become fundamental european systems namely colour information successive lines similar vertical resolution halved without serious impact perceived visual quality robust colour transmission achieved spreading information lines instead information lines recombined using delay line
secam applies principles transmitting alternately components line getting delay line required frequency modulation subcarrier used instead additional robustness sequential transmission reused much later europes last analog video systems standards
secam free saturation errors sensitive phase shifts color burst chrominance signal reason sometimes used early attempts color video recording tape speed fluctuations could systems trouble receiver require quartz crystal expensive component time generally could lower accuracy delay lines components
secam transmissions robust longer distances ntsc however owing nature color signal remains present although reduced amplitude even monochrome portions image thus subject stronger cross color
serious drawback studio work addition secam signals yield valid colour information frequency modulation necessary demodulate handle proper mixing finally remodulating cost added complexity signal degradation later years longer problem wider component digital equipment
work without delay line configuration sometimes referred poor mans could match secam terms picture quality compete level make main ideas outlined consequence license fees secam years contributed significantly estimated million francs gathered secam patents initial million francs invested research2
hence could considered hybrid system signal structure closer ntsc decoding borrowing much secam
initial specifications color french line format system however secam ever existed development phases actual deployment used line format made easy interchange conversion secam europe conversion often even needed receivers vcrs became compliant standards helped common decoding steps components furthermore scart plug became standard could take input effectively bypassing color coding formats peculiarities
comes home vcrs video standards called color format color extracted high frequencies video spectrum moved lower part spectrum available tape luminance uses remains color frequency range usually done heterodyning well ntsc nature color secam allows cheaper trick division subcarrier frequency multiplication replay became standard secam recording france countries kept using heterodyning process ntsc known mesecam recording convenient middle east countries used secam broadcasts
