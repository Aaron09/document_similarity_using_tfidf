period spinoza also became acquainted collegiants anticlerical sect remonstrants tendencies towards rationalism mennonites existed century close remonstrants39 many friends belonged dissident christian groups regularly discussion groups typically rejected authority established churches well traditional dogmas5
spinozas break prevailing dogmas judaism particularly insistence nonmosaic authorship pentateuch sudden rather appears result lengthy internal struggle anyone thinks criticism regarding authorship bible sweeping nature lacking sufficient foundation would undertake show narratives definite plan might legitimately imitated historians chronicles succeeds shall admit defeat mighty apollo confess efforts long period resulted discovery indeed write nothing fruit lengthy reflection although educated boyhood accepted beliefs concerning scripture felt bound embrace views express40

talmud torah congregation issued censure routinely matters great small edict unusual46 language spinozas censure unusually harsh however appear censure known issued portuguese jewish community amsterdam47 exact reason expelling spinoza stated48 censure refers abominable heresies practised taught monstrous deeds testimony witnesses presence said espinoza record testimony appear several likely reasons issuance censure
first spinozas radical theological views apparently expressing public philosopher spinoza biographer steven nadler puts doubt giving utterance ideas would soon appear philosophical treatises works spinoza denies immortality soul strongly rejects notion providential god—the abraham isaac jacob claims neither literally given longer binding jews mystery historys boldest radical thinkers sanctioned orthodox jewish community49
second amsterdam jewish community largely composed former conversos fled portuguese inquisition within previous century children grandchildren community must concerned protect reputation association spinoza lest controversial views provide basis possible persecution expulsion50 little evidence amsterdam municipal authorities directly involved spinozas censure 1619 town council expressly ordered portuguese jewish community regulate conduct ensure members community kept strict observance jewish law51 evidence makes clear danger upsetting civil authorities never mind bans adopted synagogue public wedding funeral processions discussing religious matters christians lest activity might disturb liberty enjoy52 thus issuance spinozas censure almost certainly part exercise selfcensorship portuguese jewish community amsterdam53
third appears likely spinoza already taken initiative separate talmud torah congregation vocally expressing hostility judaism probably stopped attending services synagogue either lawsuit sister knife attack steps might already voicing view expressed later theologicalpolitical treatise civil authorities suppress judaism harmful jews either financial reasons54 case effectively stopped contributing synagogue march 1656 also committed monstrous deed contrary regulations synagogue views rabbinical authorities including maimonides filing suit civil court rather synagogue authorities55—to renounce fathers heritage less upon notified issuance censure reported said well force anything would done accord afraid scandal56 thus unlike censure issued routinely amsterdam congregation discipline members censure issued spinoza lead repentance never withdrawn
censure spinoza said addressed apology defence written spanish elders synagogue defended views orthodox condemned rabbis accusing horrible practices enormities merely neglected ceremonial observances56 apology survive contents later included theologicalpolitical treatise56 example cited series cryptic statements medieval biblical commentator abraham ezra intimating apparently anachronistic passages pentateuch canaanite land genesis ezra called mystery exhorted understand keep silent mosaic authorship proof views valid historical precedent40
remarkable aspect censure much issuance even spinozas refusal submit fact spinozas expulsion jewish community lead conversion christianity57 spinoza kept latin implicitly christian name benedict spinoza maintained close association collegiants christian sect even moved town near collegiants headquarters buried christian graveyard—but evidence suggestion ever accepted baptism participated christian mass thus default baruch espinoza became first secular modern europe57
