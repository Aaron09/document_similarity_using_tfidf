based study british rock succession first modern system names employed reflects fact many coal beds formed globally time7 carboniferous often treated north america geological periods earlier mississippian later pennsylvanian8 terrestrial life well established carboniferous period9 amphibians dominant land vertebrates branch would eventually evolve amniotes first solely terrestrial vertebrates
arthropods also common many meganeura much larger today vast swaths forest covered land would eventually laid become coal beds characteristic carboniferous stratigraphy evident today atmospheric content oxygen also reached highest levels geological history period 3510 compared today allowing terrestrial invertebrates evolve great size10
major marine terrestrial extinction event carboniferous rainforest collapse occurred middle period caused climate change11 later half period experienced glaciations level mountain building continents collided form pangaea
