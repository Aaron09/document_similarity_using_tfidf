xray diffraction image represents slice spherical slice reciprocal space seen ewald sphere construction kout length elastic scattering since wavelength changed therefore represented radial vectors sphere reciprocal space shows values sampled given diffraction image since slight spread incoming wavelengths incoming xray beam values offqcan measured vectors located spheres corresponding radii therefore obtain full fourier transform data necessary rotate crystal slightly 180° sometimes less sufficient symmetry present full 360° rotation needed symmetry intrinsic fourier transforms real functions electron density slightly 180° needed cover reciprocal space within given resolution curvature ewald sphere practice crystal rocked small amount 0251° incorporate reflections near boundaries spherical ewalds shells

therefore autocorrelation function electron density also known patterson function121 computed directly reflection intensities without computing phases principle could used determine crystal structure directly however difficult realize practice autocorrelation function corresponds distribution vectors atoms crystal thus crystal atoms unit cell peaks patterson function given inevitable errors measuring intensities mathematical difficulties reconstructing atomic positions interatomic vectors technique rarely used solve structures except simplest crystals
advantages crystaledit
principle atomic structure could determined applying xray scattering noncrystalline samples even single molecule however crystals offer much stronger signal periodicity crystalline sample definition periodic crystal composed many unit cells repeated indefinitely three independent directions periodic systems fourier transform concentrated periodically repeating points reciprocal space known bragg peaks bragg peaks correspond reflection spots observed diffraction image since amplitude reflections grows linearly number scatterers observed intensity spots grow quadratically like words using crystal concentrates weak scattering individual unit cells much powerful coherent reflection observed noise example constructive interference
liquid powder amorphous sample molecules within sample random orientations samples continuous fourier spectrum uniformly spreads amplitude thereby reducing measured signal intensity observed saxs importantly orientational information lost although theoretically possible experimentally difficult obtain atomicresolution structures complicated asymmetric molecules rotationally averaged data intermediate case fiber diffraction subunits arranged periodically least dimension
