grant allocation bias controversyedit
2011 paper published science found black researchers less likely grants oldest widely used white researchers controlling educational background country origin training previous research awards publication record employer characteristics also found black researchers significantly less likely resubmit unapproved grant white researchers43 study lead economist donna grant said grant reviewers access applicant race infer biographies names also speculated decreased resubmission rate lack mentoring study commissioned included analysis 83000 grant applications made 2000 200644 otis brawley chief medical officer american cancer society black commented cause disparity unrelated racism rather reviewers unconscious tendency likely give benefit doubt someone familiar scientific world black researchers tend keep lower profile groups study reveal similar difficulties members races ethnic groups hispanics44

general publicedit
goals expand base medical associated sciences order ensure continued high return public investment research45 taxpayer dollars funding taxpayers making primary beneficiaries advances research thus general public stakeholder decisions resulting funding policy congress theoretically represents public interest advisory committee allocates funds director46 however many general public feel interests accurately represented result individuals formed patient advocacy groups represent interests47 patient advocacy groups tend focus specific aspects health care diseases advocates involved many different areas organizing awareness campaigns promoting patients rights enhancing health policy initiatives importantly patient advocacy groups often involved advisory panels ensure current projects projects considered funding directly impact patients lives improve delivery care provide support tertiary care advocacy groups strive promote health care system beneficial parties involved congressional representation advisory committee efforts patient advocacy groups public able influence funding allocation well policy itself48
extramural researchers scientistsedit
important stakeholders funding policy researchers scientists extramural researchers differ intramural researchers employed must apply funding throughout history amount funding received increased proportion remains relatively constant individual decide receive grant money much allotted research funding important extramural researchers multiple reasons without help grant similar type funding researchers scientists unable pursue research interests obliged follow agenda company university work could potentially hinder discoveries novel research areas 2000 brian jacobs lars lefgren researched extensively impact grants basic research development careers grant recipients period 1980–2000 reviewed postdoctoral research grants standard research grants received funding not49 jacobs lefgren found scientists received postdoctoral research grants percent likely published within first five years receiving grant49 also found scientists received grants percent likely publication percent likely five publications publish perish standard many researchers face funding great impact researchers careers49 receiving standard research grant also significant impact researchers young scientists receive firsttime grant usually produce additional publication fiveyear period receive grant receive grant typically receive 252000 funding following years49 statistically significant relationship exists scientists receiving grants research productivity throughout careers
policy changes receives funding also significantly affect researchers example recently attempted approve firsttime applicants research grant applications young scientists encourage participation young scientists potentially think outside application process shortened made easier50 addition firsttime applicants offered funding research grants received grants past51 although change provides greater opportunities young scientists also places older experienced scientists funding disadvantage
