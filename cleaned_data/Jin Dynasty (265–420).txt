administrative divisions eastern dynasty


qiaoren baijiedit
uprising five barbarians northerner eight immigrated south immigrants called qiaoren literally lodged people accounting sixth people lived south considering property refugees lost exhausted arrived privileged free diao special poll paid silken cotton cloth ancient china service registers bound white papers called baiji chinese ordinary ones bound yellow papers called huangji comparison
since situation settled preferential treatment heavy burden nation also aroused dissatisfaction natives hence duan increasingly important issue eastern
lodged administrative divisions dynastyedit
eastern court established lodged administrative divisions strongholds qiaoren effective administration realistic starting point consisting three levels qiaozhou lodged province qiaojun lodged commandery qiaoxian lodged county lodged administrative divisions merely nominal without possessing actual domain rather local government exile could scarcely denied significance jins legitimacy north territory somewhat announcement furthermore also action appease refugees homesickness home town complex evoking desire resume lost
emperor yuan emperor ming emperor cheng period lodged administrative divisions concentrated area south huai river lower yangtze plain first lodged langya commandery within lodged county jiankang began exact lodged huaide county also established jiankang around according book song

晉永嘉大亂，幽、冀、青、並、兗州及徐州之淮北流民，相率過淮，亦有過江在晉陵郡界者……又徙流民之在淮南者于晉陵諸縣，其徙過江南及留在江北者，並立僑郡縣以司牧之。徐、兗二州或治江北，江北又僑立幽、冀、青、並四州……after disaster yongjia refugees qing bing provinces came across huai river even came across yangtze river stayed jinling commandery lodged administrative divisions established govern seats provinces perhaps moved area north yangtze river lodged qing bing provinces established12

lodged qinghe xiapi dongguang pingchang jiyin puyang guangping taishan jiyang commanderies stablished emperor ming ruled rebellions invasions occurred jianghuai area refugees switched settle south yangtze river lodged huainan commandery established afterwards
however carrying complex policy formulated several actual counties jurisdiction lodged commanderies
lodged administrative divisions still retained china nowadays instance dangtu county originally located area bengbu however lodged dangtu county established latter replaced former inheriting place name
duan policy dynastyedit
duan abbreviation duan means classifying people according present habitation register policy ensure ancient hukou system working since western terms firstly recorded biographies guan chong included book

今九域同規，大化方始，臣等以為宜皆蕩除末法，一擬古制，以土斷，定自公卿以下，皆以所居為正，無復懸客遠屬異土者。13


然承魏氏凋弊之跡，人物播越，仕無常朝，人無定處，郎吏蓄於軍府，豪右聚於都邑，事體駁錯，與古不同。謂九品既除，宜先開移徙，聽相並就。且明貢舉之法，不濫於境外，則冠帶之倫將不分而自均，即土斷之實行矣。14

hence perhaps proposed initially persons implemented seriously eastern southern dynasties
