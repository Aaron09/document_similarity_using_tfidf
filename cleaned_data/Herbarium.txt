preparing plant mounting


commensurate need wildlife conservation often desirable include herbarium sheet much plant possible flowers stems leaves seed fruit least representative parts case large specimens8 preserve form colour plants collected field carefully arranged spread flat thin sheets known flimsies equivalent sheets newsprint dried usually plant press blotters absorbent paper8 drying process specimens retained within flimsies times minimise damage thicker absorbent drying sheets replaced plants prove helpful allow fresh specimen wilt slightly arranged press opportunity check rearrange specimen best reveal required features plant occurs damp absorbent sheets changed dryingpressing process
specimens mounted sheets stiff white paper labelled essential data date place found description plant altitude special habitat conditions sheet placed protective case precaution insect attack pressed plant frozen poisoned case disinfected
certain groups plants soft bulky otherwise amenable drying mounting sheets plants methods preparation storage used example conifer cones palm fronds stored labelled boxes representative flowers fruits pickled formaldehyde preserve threedimensional structure small specimens mosses lichens often airdried packaged small paper envelopes2
matter method preservation detailed information plant collected habitat color since fade time name collector usually included
value herbarium much enhanced possession “types” original specimens study species founded thus herbarium british museum especially rich earlier collections made eighteenth early nineteenth centuries contains types many species founded earlier workers botany also rich types australian plants collections joseph banks robert brown contains addition many valuable modern collections

large herbarium hundreds cases filled specimens


herbaria utilize standard system organizing specimens herbarium cases specimen sheets stacked groups species belong placed large lightweight folder labelled bottom edge groups species folders placed together larger heavier folders genus genus folders sorted taxonomic family according standard system selected herbarium placed pigeonholes herbarium cabinets10
locating specimen filed herbarium requires knowing nomenclature classification used herbarium also requires familiarity possible name changes occurred since specimen collected since specimen filed older name
modern herbaria often maintain electronic databases collections many herbaria initiatives digitize specimens produce virtual herbarium records images made publicly accessible internet possible
usesedit
herbarium collections great significance value science large number uses1112 herbaria essential study plant taxonomy study geographic distributions stabilizing nomenclature linnaeuss herbarium belongs linnean society england
specimens housed herbaria used catalogue identify flora area large collection single area used writing field guide manual identification plants grow specimens available author guide better understand variability form plants natural distribution plants grow
herbaria also preserve historical record change vegetation time cases plants become extinct area become extinct altogether cases specimens preserved herbarium represent record plants original distribution environmental scientists make data track changes climate human impact
herbaria also proven useful sources plant taxonomy molecular systematics
many kinds scientists naturalists herbaria preserve voucher specimens representative samples plants used particular study demonstrate precisely source data enable confirmation identification future date8
