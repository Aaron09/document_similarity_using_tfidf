global climate triassic mostly dry11 deserts spanning much pangaeas interior however climate shifted became humid pangaea began drift apart period marked another major mass extinction triassic–jurassic extinction event wiped many groups allowed dinosaurs assume dominance jurassic
triassic named 1834 friedrich alberti three distinct rock layers meaning three found throughout germany northwestern europe—red beds capped marine limestone followed series terrestrial sandstones—called trias12

triassic almost earths land mass concentrated single supercontinent centered less equator spanning pole pole called pangaea land east along equator tethys penetrated pangaea causing paleotethys ocean closed
later midtriassic similar penetrated along equator west remaining shores surrounded worldocean known panthalassa deepocean sediments laid triassic disappeared subduction oceanic plates thus little known triassic open ocean
supercontinent pangaea rifting triassic—especially late period—but separated first nonmarine sediments rift marks initial breakup pangaea separated jersey morocco late triassic thick sediments comprise newark group14
supercontinental mass less shoreline compared broken triassic marine deposits globally relatively rare despite prominence western europe triassic first studied north america example marine deposits limited exposures west thus triassic stratigraphy mostly based organisms lived lagoons hypersaline environments estheria crustaceans
africaedit

climateedit
triassic continental interior climate generally typical deposits sandstones evaporites evidence glaciation near either pole fact polar regions apparently moist temperate providing climate suitable forests vertebrates including reptiles pangaeas large size limited moderating effect global ocean continental climate highly seasonal summers cold winters16 strong contrast pangea supercontinent global ocean triggered intense crossequatorial monsoons16
triassic mostly period evidence exists punctuated several episodes increased rainfall tropical subtropical latitudes tethys surrounding land17 sediments fossils suggestive humid climate known anisian ladinian tethysian domain carnian rhaetian larger area includes also boreal domain svalbard islands north american continent south china block argentina
best studied episodes humid climate probably intense widespread carnian pluvial event

mass extinction event marked


triassic period ended mass extinction particularly severe oceans conodonts disappeared marine reptiles except ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs invertebrates like brachiopods gastropods molluscs severely affected oceans marine families possibly half marine genera went missing
though endtriassic extinction event equally devastating terrestrial ecosystems several important clades crurotarsans large archosaurian reptiles previously grouped together thecodonts disappeared large labyrinthodont amphibians groups small reptiles synapsids except protomammals early primitive dinosaurs also became extinct adaptive ones survived evolve jurassic surviving plants went dominate mesozoic world included modern conifers cycadeoids

number late triassic extinctions disputed studies suggest least periods extinction towards triassic separated million years arguing recent study north american faunas petrified forest northeast arizona unique sequence late carnianearly norian terrestrial sediments analysis 2002 found significant change paleoenvironment39 phytosaurs common fossils experienced changeover genus level number species remained aetosaurs next common tetrapods early dinosaurs passed unchanged however phytosaurs aetosaurs among groups archosaur reptiles completely wiped endtriassic extinction event
seems likely sort endcarnian extinction several herbivorous archosauromorph groups died large herbivorous therapsids— kannemeyeriid dicynodonts traversodont cynodonts—were much reduced northern half pangaea laurasia
extinctions within triassic allowed dinosaurs expand many niches become unoccupied dinosaurs became increasingly dominant abundant diverse remained next million years true dinosaurs following jurassic cretaceous periods rather triassic
