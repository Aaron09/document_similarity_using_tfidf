printmaking woodcuts engravings smarthistory


overviewedit
printmaking techniques generally divided following basic categories

relief applied original surface matrix relief techniques include woodcut woodblock asian forms usually known wood engraving linocut metalcut
intaglio applied beneath original surface matrix intaglio techniques include engraving etching mezzotint aquatint
planographic matrix retains original surface specially prepared andor inked allow transfer image planographic techniques include lithography monotyping digital techniques
stencil paint pressed prepared screen including screenprinting pochoir

types printmaking techniques outside groups include collagraphy viscosity printing collagraphy printmaking technique textured material adhered printing matrix texture transferred paper printing process contemporary printmaking include digital printing photographic mediums combination digital photographic traditional processes
many techniques also combined especially within family example rembrandts prints usually referred etchings convenience often include work engraving drypoint well sometimes etching
woodcutedit
artists using technique include
albrecht dürer ernst ludwig kirchner dulah marie evans hiroshige hokusai gustave baumann hannah tompkins hussein gebaly carlos alvarado lang

main article woodcut




félix vallotton raison probante cogent reason woodcut series intimités 1898






ernst ludwig kirchner portrait otto müller 1915


woodcut type relief print earliest printmaking technique traditionally used east probably first developed means printing patterns cloth century used china printing text images paper woodcuts images paper developed around 1400 japan slightly later europe areas woodcut extensively used purely process making images without text




woodcuts stanislaw raczynski 19031982


artist draws design plank wood paper transferred wood traditionally artist handed work specialist cutter uses sharp tools carve away parts block receive surface block inked brayer sheet paper perhaps slightly damp placed block block rubbed baren spoon printing press color separate blocks used color technique called reduction printing used
reduction printing name used describe process using block print several layers color print usually involves cutting small amount block away printing block many times different sheets washing block cutting away printing next color allows previous color show process repeated many times advantages process block needed different components intricate design line perfectly disadvantage artist moves next layer prints made
another variation woodcut printmaking cukil technique made famous taring padi underground community java indonesia taring padi posters usually resemble intricately printed cartoon posters embedded political messages images—usually resembling visually complex scenario—are carved unto wooden surface called cukilan smothered printers pressing unto media paper canvas
engravingedit
main article engraving




melencolia engraving albrecht dürer important printmakers


process developed germany 1430s engraving used goldsmiths decorate metalwork engravers hardened steel tool called burin design surface metal plate traditionally made copper engraving using burin generally difficult skill learn
gravers come variety shapes sizes yield different line types burin produces unique recognizable quality line characterized steady deliberate appearance clean edges tools mezzotint rockers roulettes tool finetoothed wheel burnishers tool used making object smooth shiny rubbing used texturing effects
make print engraved plate inked wiped surface leaving engraved lines plate highpressure printing press together sheet paper often moistened soften paper picks engraved lines making print process repeated many times typically several hundred impressions copies could printed printing plate shows much sign wear except drypoint gives much shallower lines used
20th century true engraving revived serious form artists including stanley william hayter whose studio paris york city became magnet artists pablo picasso alberto giacometti mauricio lasansky joan miró
etchingedit
artists using technique include albrecht dürer rembrandt francisco goya whistler otto james ensor edward hopper käthe kollwitz pablo picasso twombly lucas leyden carlos alvarado lang
main article etching
etching part intaglio family along engraving drypoint mezzotint aquatint process believed invented daniel hopfer circa 14701536 augsburg germany decorated armor applied method printmaking etching soon came challenge engraving popular printmaking medium great advantage unlike engraving requires special skill metalworking etching relatively easy learn artist trained drawing




three crosses etching rembrandt


etching prints generally linear often contain fine detail contours lines vary smooth sketchy etching opposite woodcut raised portions etching remain blank crevices hold pure etching metal usually copper zinc steel plate covered waxy acrylic ground artist draws ground pointed etching needle exposed metal lines etched dipping plate bath etchant nitric acid ferric chloride etchant bites exposed metal leaving behind lines plate remaining ground cleaned plate printing process engraving
mezzotintedit
main article mezzotint
intaglio variant engraving image formed subtle gradations light shade mezzotint—from italian mezzo half tinta tone—is dark manner form printmaking requires artists work dark light create mezzotint surface copper printing plate roughened evenly tool known rocker image formed smoothing surface tool known burnisher inked roughened areas plate hold print darkly smoother areas plate hold less print lightly however possible create image roughening plate selectively working light dark
mezzotint known luxurious quality tones first evenly finely roughened surface holds allowing deep solid colors printed secondly process smoothing texture burin burnisher scraper allows fine gradations tone developed
mezzotint printmaking method invented ludwig siegen 1609–1680 process used widely england mideighteenth century reproduce paintings portraits
aquatintedit




sleep reason creates monsters etching aquatint francisco goya


main article aquatint
technique used intaglio etchings like etching aquatint technique involves application acid make marks metal plate etching technique uses needle make lines retain aquatint relies powdered rosin acid resistant ground create tonal effect rosin applied light dusting booth rosin cooked plate time rosin burnished scratched affect tonal qualities tonal variation controlled level acid exposure large areas thus image shaped large sections time
goya used aquatint prints
drypointedit
main article drypoint
variant engraving done sharp point rather vshaped burin engraved lines smooth hardedged drypoint scratching leaves rough burr edges line burr gives drypoint prints characteristically soft sometimes blurry line quality pressure printing quickly destroys burr drypoint useful small editions twenty impressions counter allow longer print runs electroplating called steelfacing used since nineteenth century harden surface plate
technique appears invented housebook master south german fifteenthcentury artist whose prints drypoint among famous artists master print albrecht dürer produced three drypoints abandoning technique rembrandt used frequently usually conjunction etching engraving

lithographyedit
artists using technique include
honoré daumier vincent gogh george bellows pierre bonnard edvard munch emil nolde pablo picasso odilon redon henri toulouselautrec salvador dalí escher willem kooning joan miró stow wengenroth

main article lithography




goulue lithograph poster toulouselautrec


lithography technique invented 1798 alois senefelder based chemical repulsion water porous surface normally limestone used image drawn limestone greasy medium acid applied transferring grease limestone leaving image burned surface arabic watersoluble substance applied sealing surface stone covered drawing medium stone wetted water staying surface covered greasebased residue drawing stone rolled meaning applied roller covering entire surface since water repels adheres greasy parts perfectly inking image sheet paper placed surface image transferred paper pressure printing press lithography known ability capture fine gradations shading small detail
variant photolithography image captured photographic processes metal plates printing carried
screenprintingedit
artists using technique include
josef albers ralston crawford gene davis robert indiana lichtenstein julian opie bridget riley edward ruscha andy warhol carlos alvarado lang

main article screenprinting
screenprinting occasionally known silkscreen serigraphy creates prints using fabric stencil technique simply pushed stencil surface paper often squeegee generally technique uses natural synthetic mesh fabric stretched tightly across rectangular frame much like stretched canvas fabric silk nylon monofilament multifilament polyester even stainless steel1 commercial screenprinting often requires hightech mechanical apparatuses calibrated materials printmakers value approach technical requirements high quality results essential tools required squeegee mesh fabric frame stencil unlike many printmaking processes printing press required screenprinting essentially stencil printing
screenprinting adapted printing variety materials paper cloth canvas rubber glass metal artists used technique print bottles slabs granite directly onto walls reproduce images textiles would distort pressure printing presses
monotypeedit




monotype techniques inventor giovanni benedetto castiglione creation adam 1642


main article monotyping
monotyping type printmaking made drawing painting smooth nonabsorbent surface surface matrix historically copper etching plate contemporary work vary zinc glass acrylic glass image transferred onto sheet paper pressing together usually using printingpress monotypes also created inking entire surface using brushes rags removing create subtractive image creating lights field opaque color inks used based water based based inks paper case image contrast paper damp case image percent greater range tones
unlike monoprinting monotyping produces unique print monotype removed initial pressing although subsequent reprintings sometimes possible differ greatly first print generally considered inferior second print original plate called ghost print cognate stencils watercolor solvents brushes tools often used embellish monotype print monotypes often spontaneously executed preliminary sketch
monotypes painterly method among printmaking techniques unique print essentially printed painting principal characteristic medium found spontaneity combination printmaking painting drawing media2
monoprintedit
main article monoprinting
monoprinting form printmaking uses matrix woodblock litho stone copper plate produces impressions unique multiple unique impressions printed single matrix sometimes known variable edition many techniques used monoprinting including collagraph collage handpainted additions form tracing thick laid table paper placed back paper drawn transferring paper monoprints also made altering type color viscosity used create different prints traditional printmaking techniques lithography woodcut intaglio used make monoprints
mixedmedia printsedit
mixedmedia prints multiple traditional printmaking processes etching woodcut letterpress silkscreen even monoprinting creation print also incorporate elements chine colle collage painted areas unique oneoff noneditioned prints mixedmedia prints often experimental prints printed unusual nontraditional surfaces
digital printsedit
artists using technique include
istvan horkay ralph goings enrique chagoya

main article digital printing
digital prints refers images printed using digital printers inkjet printers instead traditional printing press images printed variety substrates including paper cloth plastic canvas
dyebased inksedit
dyebased inks organic mineral dissolved mixed liquid although synthetic derived petroleum made vegetable animal sources dyes well suited textiles liquid penetrates chemically bonds fiber deep penetration layers material must lose color fading apparent dyes however suitable relatively thin layers laid surface print
pigmentbased inksedit
pigment finely ground particulate substance mixed ground liquid make paint dissolve remains dispersed suspended liquid pigments categorized either inorganic mineral organic synthetic3 pigmentbased inks much longer permanence dyebased inks4
gicléeedit
giclée pron ʒiːˈkleɪ zheeklay dʒiːˈkleɪ neologism coined 1991 printmaker jack duganne digital prints made inkjet printers originally associated early dyebased printers often refers pigmentbased prints6 word based french word gicleur means nozzle today fine prints produced large format inkjet machines using ccmmyk color model generally called giclée
foil imagingedit
foil imaging printmaking technique made using iowa foil printer developed virginia myers commercial foil stamping process uses gold leaf acrylic foil printmaking process

printmakers apply color prints many different ways coloring techniques include positive surface roll negative surface roll poupée often color printmaking involves etching screenprinting woodcut linocut applied either using separate plates blocks screens using reductionist approach multiple plate color techniques number plates screens blocks produced providing different color separate plate screen block inked different color applied particular sequence produce entire picture average three four plates produced occasions printmaker seven plates every application another plate color interact color already applied paper must kept mind producing separation colors lightest colors often applied first darker colors successively darkest
reductionist approach producing color start lino wood block either blank simple etching upon printing color printmaker lino woodblock removing material apply another color reprint successive removal lino wood block expose already printed color viewer print picasso often cited inventor reduction printmaking although evidence method years picassos linocuts7
subtractive color concept also used offset digital print present bitmap vectorial software cmyk color spaces
registrationedit
printmaking processes requiring application medium problem exists line properly areas image receive application obvious example would multicolor image color applied separate step lining results step multistep printmaking process called registration proper registration results various components image proper place artistic reasons improper registration necessarily ruination image
vary considerably process process generally involves placing substrate generally paper correct alignment printmaking element supplying coloration8
protective printmaking equipmentedit
protective clothing important printmakers engage etching lithography closed toed shoes long pants whereas past printmakers plates acid baths bare hands today printmakers rubber gloves also wear industrial respirators protection caustic vapors acid baths built ventilation hoods
protective respirators masks particle filters particularly aquatinting part aquatinting process printmaker often exposed rosin powder rosin serious health hazard especially printmakers past simply used hold breathcitation needed using aquatinting booth
