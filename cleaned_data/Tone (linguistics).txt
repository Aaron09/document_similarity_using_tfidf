four main tones standard mandarin pronounced syllable
















tone pitch language distinguish lexical grammatical meaning distinguish inflect words1 verbal languages pitch express emotional paralinguistic information convey emphasis contrast features called intonation languages tones distinguish words inflections analogously consonants vowels languages feature called tonal languages distinctive tone patterns language sometimes called tonemes2 analogy phoneme tonal languages extremely common africa east asia mexico rare elsewhere asia europe many seventy percent world languages tonal1
many tonal african languages bantu languages tones distinguished pitch level relative known register tone system3 multisyllable words single tone carried entire word rather different tone syllable often grammatical information past versus present versus positive versus negative conveyed solely tone
widely spoken tonal language mandarin chinese tones distinguished distinctive shape known contour tone different internal pattern rising falling pitch4 many words especially monosyllabic ones differentiated solely tone multisyllabic word syllable often carries tone unlike bantu systems tone plays little role modern chinese grammar though tones descend features chinese morphological significance changing verb noun vice versa
contour systems typical languages mainland southeast asia linguistic area including tai–kadai vietic sinotibetan languages afroasiatic khoisan nigercongo nilosaharan languages spoken africa dominated register systems5 languages combine systems cantonese produces three varieties contour tone three different pitch levels6 omotic afroasiatic language bench employs five level tones rising tones across levels7

andrégeorges haudricourt established vietnamese tone originated earlier consonantal contrasts suggested similar mechanisms chinese35 widely held chinese phonemically contrastive tonecitation needed historical origin tone called tonogenesis term coined james matisoff tone frequently areal rather genealogical feature language acquire tones bilingualism influential neighbouring languages tonal speakers tonal language shift language question bring tones cases tone arise spontaneously surprisingly quickly dialect cherokee oklahoma tone dialect north carolina although separated 1838
often tone arises effect loss merger consonants trace effects disappeared tones sounds nicknamed cheshirisation lingering smile disappearing cheshire alice wonderland nontonal language voiced consonants commonly cause following vowels pronounced lower pitch consonants usually minor phonetic detail voicing however consonant voicing subsequently lost incidental pitch difference left carry distinction voicing carried thus becomes meaningful phonemic happened punjabi punjabi murmured voiced aspirate consonants disappeared left tone wake murmured consonant beginning word left behind tone left behind high tone consonant pitch unaffected however unaffected words limited pitch interfere high tones produced tone tone historical connection regular punjabi still written murmured consonants tone marked written consonants tell reader tone
similarly final fricatives consonants phonetically affect pitch preceding vowels weaken finally disappear completely difference pitch true difference tone carries stead case chinese three tones middle chinese rising departing tones arose chinese final consonants disappeared syllables ended neither consonants interpreted carrying third tone even varieties descending middle chinese affected tone split tone divided depending whether initial consonant voiced vowels following voiced consonant depressor consonant acquired lower tone voicing lost distinctiveness
changes affected many languages area around time 1000–1500 tone split example also occurred thai vietnamese lhasa dialect tibetan
general voiced initial consonants lead tones vowels aspirated consonants acquire high tone final consonants lost glottal stop tends leave preceding vowel high rising tone although glottalized vowels tend tone glottal stop causes vowel glottalization tend leave behind vowel final fricative tends leave preceding vowel falling tone vowel phonation also frequently develops tone seen case burmese
tone arose athabascan languages least twice patchwork systems languages navajo syllables glottalized consonants including glottal stops syllable coda developed tones whereas others slavey developed high tones tonal systems almost mirror images syllables without glottalized codas developed opposite tone example high tone navajo tone slavey contrast tone triggered glottalization
