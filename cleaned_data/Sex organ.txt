developmentedit
main article development reproductive system
typical prenatal development sexual organs originate common anlage anatomy early gestation differentiate male female variations gene usually located chromosome encoding testis determining factor determines direction differentiation absence allows gonads continue develop ovaries
thereafter development internal reproductive organs external genitalia determined hormones produced certain fetal gonads ovaries testes cells response initial appearance fetal genitalia weeks conception looks basically feminine pair urogenital folds small protuberance middle urethra behind protuberance fetus testes testes produce testosterone cells genitals respond testosterone outer urogenital folds swell fuse midline produce scrotum protuberance grows larger straighter form penis inner urogenital swellings grow wrap around penis fuse midline form penile urethra
sexual organ homologous counterpart list homologues human reproductive system larger perspective whole process sexual differentiation also includes development secondary sexual characteristics patterns pubic facial hair female breasts emerge puberty furthermore differences brain structure arise affecting absolutely determining behavior
intersex development genitalia somewhere typical male female genitalia child born parents faced decisions often difficult make whether modify genitalia assign child male female leave genitalia parents allow doctors choose decide modify genitalia approximately chance getting genitalia match childs gender identity pick wrong child begin show symptoms transsexualism lead life discomfort able remedy issue10
strong sexual selection affecting structure function genitalia form organ system evolves faster other11 great variety genital form function therefore found among animals
