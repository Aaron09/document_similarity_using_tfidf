calculationedit
information life table mathematics




survival tree explain calculations lifeexpectancy numbers indicate chance survival specific blue ones indicate agespecific death rates


starting point calculating life expectancy agespecific death rates population members large number data available statistical population created allow agespecific death rates simply taken mortality rates actually experienced number deaths divided number years exposed risk data cell however customary apply smoothing iron much possible random statistical fluctuations year next past simple model used purpose gompertz function sophisticated methods used107
common methods used purpose

mathematical formula extension gompertz function data
relatively small amounts data look established mortality table previously derived larger population make simple adjustment multiply constant factor data
large number data looks mortality rates actually experienced applies smoothing cubic splines

data required easily identified case humans computation life expectancy industrial products wild animals involves indirect techniques life expectancy demography wild animals often estimated capturing marking recapturing them108 life product often termed shelf life also computed using similar methods case longlived components used critical applications aircraft methods like accelerated aging used model life expectancy component5

important note statistic usually based past mortality experience assumes agespecific mortality rates continue future thus life expectancy figures need adjusted temporal trends calculating long currently living individual particular expected live period life expectancy remains commonly used statistic summarize current health status population
however purposes pensions calculations usual adjust life table used assuming agespecific death rates continue decrease years usually done past often done simply extrapolating past trends models exist account evolution mortality like lee–carter model110

forecastingedit
forecasting life expectancy mortality forms important subdivision demography future trends life expectancy huge implications oldage support programs like social security pension since cash flow systems depends number recipients still living along rate return investments rate payasyougo systems longer life expectancies systems increased cash outflow systems underestimate increases lifeexpectancies unprepared large payments occur humans live longer longer
life expectancy forecasting usually based different approaches

forecasting life expectancy directly generally using arima time series extrapolation procedures advantage simplicity cannot account changes mortality specific ages forecast number cannot used derive life table results analyses forecasts using approach done common statisticalmathematical software package like eviews stata matlab spss
forecasting specific death rates computing life expectancy results life table methods usually complex simply forecasting life expectancy analyst must deal correlated agespecific mortality rates seems robust simple onedimensional time series approaches also yields specificrates used derive measures survival curves life expectancies different ages important approach within group leecarter model111 uses singular value decomposition transformed agespecific mortality rates reduce dimensionality single time series forecasts time series recovers full agespecific mortality rates forecasted value software includes professor hyndmans package called demography berkeleys lcfit system

policy usesedit
