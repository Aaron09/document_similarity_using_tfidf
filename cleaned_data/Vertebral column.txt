typical vertebra consists parts vertebral body vertebral arch vertebral arch posterior meaning faces back person together enclose vertebral foramen contains spinal cord spinal cord ends lumbar spine sacrum coccyx fused contain central foramen vertebral arch formed pair pedicles pair laminae supports seven processes four articular transverse spinous latter also known neural spine transverse processes spinous process posterior behind vertebral body spinous process comes back transverse process comes left right spinous processes cervical lumbar regions felt skin
vertebra joints called facet joints restrict range movement possible joined thin portion neural arch called pars interarticularis pair vertebrae small holes called intervertebral foramina spinal nerves leave spinal cord holes

spinal cord nested vertebral column


main article spinal cord
vertebral column surrounds spinal cord travels within spinal canal formed central hole within vertebra spinal cord part central nervous system supplies nerves receives information peripheral nervous system within body spinal cord consists grey white matter central cavity central canal adjacent vertebra emerge spinal nerves spinal nerves provide sympathetic nervous supply body nerves emerging forming sympathetic trunk splanchnic nerves
spinal canal follows different curves column large triangular parts column enjoy greatest freedom movement cervical lumbar regions small rounded thoracic region motion limitedcitation needed
spinal cord terminates conus medullaris cauda equina
clinical significanceedit
diseaseedit
spina bifida congenital disorder defective closure vertebral arch sometimes spinal meninges also spinal cord protrude called spina bifida cystica condition involve protrusion known spina bifida occulta sometimes vertebral arches remain incomplete10 another though rare congenital disease klippelfeil syndrome fusion cervical vertebrae
spondylolisthesis forward displacement vertebra retrolisthesis posterior displacement vertebral body respect adjacent vertebra degree less dislocation
spinal disc herniation commonly called slipped disc result tear outer ring anulus fibrosus intervertebral disc lets soft gellike material nucleus pulposus bulge hernia
spinal stenosis narrowing spinal canal occur region spine though less commonly thoracic region stenosis constrict spinal canal giving rise neurological deficit
pain coccyx tailbone known coccydynia11
spinal cord injury damage spinal cord causes changes function either temporary permanent
curvatureedit
excessive abnormal spinal curvature classed spinal disease dorsopathy includes following abnormal curvatures

kyphosis exaggerated kyphotic concave curvature thoracic region also called hyperkyphosis produces socalled humpback dowagers hump condition commonly resulting osteoporosis
lordosis exaggerated lordotic convex curvature lumbar region known lumbar hyperlordosis also swayback temporary lordosis common pregnancy
scoliosis lateral curvature common abnormal curvature occurring population common among females result unequal growth sides vertebrae fuse properly also caused pulmonary atelectasis partial complete deflation lobes lungs observed asthma pneumothorax
kyphoscoliosis combination kyphosis scoliosis

vertebra diameter small rayfinned fish


also fish anatomy vertebrae
vertebrae lobefinned fishes consist three discrete bony elements vertebral arch surrounds spinal cord broadly similar form found vertebrates beneath arch lies small platelike pleurocentrum protects upper surface notochord larger archshaped intercentrum protect lower border structures embedded within single cylindrical mass cartilage similar arrangement found primitive labyrinthodonts evolutionary line reptiles hence also mammals birds intercentrum became partially wholly replaced enlarged pleurocentrum turn became bony vertebral body15 rayfinned fishes including teleosts structures fused embedded within solid piece bone superficially resembling vertebral body mammals living amphibians simply cylindrical piece bone vertebral arch trace separate elements present early tetrapods15
cartilaginous fish sharks vertebrae consist cartilaginous tubes upper tube formed vertebral arches also includes additional cartilaginous structures filling gaps vertebrae enclosing spinal cord essentially continuous sheath lower tube surrounds notochord complex structure often including multiple layers calcification15
lampreys vertebral arches nothing resembling vertebral bodies found higher vertebrates even arches discontinuous consisting separate pieces archshaped cartilage around spinal cord parts body changing long strips cartilage tail region hagfishes lack true vertebral column therefore properly considered vertebrates tiny neural arches present tail15

general structure human vertebrae fairly typical found mammals reptiles birds shape vertebral body however vary somewhat different groups mammals humans typically flat upper lower surfaces reptiles anterior surface commonly concave socket expanded convex face next vertebral body fits even patterns generalisations however variation form vertebrae along length spine even within single species unusual variations include saddleshaped sockets cervical vertebrae birds presence narrow hollow canal running centre vertebral bodies geckos tuataras containing remnant notochord15
reptiles often retain primitive intercentra present small crescentshaped bony elements lying bodies adjacent vertebrae similar structures often found caudal vertebrae mammals tail attached chevronshaped bones called haemal arches attach base spine help support musculature latter bones probably homologous ventral ribs fish number vertebrae spines reptiles highly variable several hundred species snake15
birds variable number cervical vertebrae often form truly flexible part spine thoracic vertebrae partially fused providing solid brace wings flight sacral vertebrae fused lumbar vertebrae thoracic caudal vertebrae form single structure synsacrum thus greater relative length sacrum mammals living birds remaining caudal vertebrae fused bone pygostyle attachment tail feathers15
aside tail number vertebrae mammals generally fairly constant almost always seven cervical vertebrae sloths manatees among exceptions followed around twenty vertebrae divided thoracic lumbar forms depending number ribs generally three five vertebrae sacrum anything fifty caudal vertebrae15
