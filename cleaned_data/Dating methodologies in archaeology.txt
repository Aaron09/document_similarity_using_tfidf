dating methodsedit
dating methods commonly classified following criteria relative dating absolute dating
relative datingedit
main article relative dating
relative dating methods unable determine absolute object event determine impossibility particular event happening another event absolute date well known relative dating method latin terms ante quem post quem usually used indicate oldest recent possible moments event occurred artifact left stratum method also useful many disciplines historians example know shakespeares play henry written 1587 shakespeares primary source writing play second edition raphael holinsheds chronicles published 15871 thus 1587 post quem dating shakespeares play henry means play without fail written latin post 1587
inductive mechanism applied archaeology geology paleontology many ways example stratum presenting difficulties ambiguities absolute dating paleopalynology used relative referent means study pollens found stratum admitted simple reason botanical species whether extinct well known belonging determined position scale time
nonexhaustive list relative dating methods relative dating applications used geology paleontology archaeology following

crosscutting relationships

seriation archaeology
sequence dating type seriation
palynology study moderndated pollens relative dating archaeological strata also used forensic palynology
paleopalynology also spelt palaeopalynology study fossilized pollens relative dating geological strata

absolute datingedit
main article absolute dating
absolute dating methods using absolute referent criteria mainly include radiometric dating methods4 examples radiometric nonradiometric absolute dating methods following

amino acid dating5678
archaeomagnetic dating9
argon–argon dating
uranium–lead dating
samarium–neodymium dating
potassium–argon dating
rubidium–strontium dating
uranium–thorium dating
radiocarbon dating
fission track dating
optically stimulated luminescence
luminescence dating
thermoluminescence dating type luminescence dating
iodine–xenon dating
lead–lead dating
oxidizable carbon ratio dating
rehydroxylation dating10
cementochronology method determine precise moment scale time death dead individual
wiggle matching
datestone exclusively used archaeology
obsidian hydration dating exclusively used archaeology
tephrochronology
molecular clock used mostly phylogenetics evolutionary biology
dendrochronology
herbchronology

dating methods archaeologyedit
geologists paleontologists archaeologists also brought determine ancient materials case areas studies restricted history ancient recent humans thus considered archaeological remains objects artifacts dated must related human activity commonly assumed remains elements dated older human species disciplines study sciences geology paleontology among others
nevertheless range time within archaeological dating enormous compared average lifespan singular human example pinnacle points caves southern coast south africa provided evidence marine resources shellfish regularly exploited humans 170000 years agocitation needed hand remains recent hundred years also target archaeological dating methods case 18thcentury sloop whose excavation south carolina united states 199211 thus oldest youngest archaeological sites likely dated appropriate method
dating material drawn archaeological record made direct study artifact deduced association materials found context item drawn inferred point discovery sequence relative datable contexts dating carried mainly post excavation support good practice preliminary dating work called spot dating usually tandem excavation dating important archaeology constructing models past relies integrity dateable objects samples many disciplines archaeological science concerned dating evidence practice several different dating techniques must applied circumstances thus dating evidence much archaeological sequence recorded excavation requires matching information known absolute associated steps careful study stratigraphic relationships
addition particular relation past human presence past human activity archaeology uses almost dating methods shares sciences particular variations like following
written markersedit

epigraphy analysis inscriptions identifying graphemes clarifying meanings classifying uses according dates cultural contexts drawing conclusions writing writers
numismatics many coins date production written specified historical record
palaeography study ancient writing including practice deciphering reading dating historical manuscripts

seriationedit
