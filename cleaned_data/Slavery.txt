slavery common labour done relatively simple thus easy supervise largescale growing single crop much difficult costly check slaves best good quality complex tasks therefore slavery seen efficient method production largescale crops like sugar cotton whose output based economies scale enabled gang system labour prominent large plantations field hands monitored worked factorylike precision work gang based internal division labour assigned every member gang precise task simultaneously made performance dependent actions others hands chopped weeds surrounded cotton plants well excessive sprouts plow gangs followed behind stirring soil near rows cotton plants tossing back around plants thus gang system worked like early version assembly line later found factories294
critics since 18th century argued slavery tends retard technological advancement since focus increasing number slaves simple tasks rather upgrading efficiency labour theoretical knowledge learning greece—and later rome—was applied ease physical labour improve manufacturing295
adam smith made argument free labour economically better slave labour argued slavery europe ended middle ages church state separate independent strong institutions296 nearly impossible slavery free democratic republican forms governments since many legislators political figures slave owners would punish slaves would better able gain freedom centralized government central authority like king church297 similar arguments appear later works auguste comte especially comes adam smiths belief separation powers comte called separation spiritual temporal middle ages slavery smiths criticism masters past present smith stated lectures jurisprudence great power clergy thus concurring king slaves liberty absolutely necessary authority king clergy great ever wanting slavery still continues
