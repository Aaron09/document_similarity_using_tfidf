johannes kepler first noticed 1596 something strange orbits mars jupiter


also definition planet list minor planets
1596 johannes kepler predicted “between mars jupiter place planet” mysterium cosmographicum13 analyzing tycho brahes data kepler thought large orbits mars jupiter14
anonymous footnote 1766 translation charles bonnets contemplation nature15 astronomer johann daniel titius wittenberg1617 noted apparent pattern layout planets began numerical sequence included doubling time added four number divided produced remarkably close approximation radii orbits known planets measured astronomical units provided allowed missing planet equivalent sequence orbits mars jupiter footnote titius declared lord architect left space empty all16
william herschel discovered uranus 1781 planets orbit matched almost perfectly leading astronomers conclude planet orbits mars jupiter




giuseppe piazzi discoverer ceres largest object asteroid belt several decades discovery ceres known planet reclassified asteroid 2006 designated dwarf planet


january 1801 giuseppe piazzi chair astronomy university palermo sicily found tiny moving object orbit exactly radius predicted pattern dubbed ceres roman goddess harvest patron sicily piazzi initially believed comet lack coma suggested planet18
thus aforementioned pattern known titius–bode predicted semimajor axes eight planets time mercury venus earth mars ceres jupiter saturn uranus
fifteen months later heinrich olbers discovered second object region pallas unlike known planets ceres pallas remained points light even highest telescope magnifications instead resolving discs apart rapid movement appeared indistinguishable stars
accordingly 1802 william herschel suggested placed separate category named asteroids greek asteroeides meaning starlike1920 upon completing series observations ceres pallas concluded21

neither appellation planets comets propriety language given stars resemble small stars much hardly distinguished asteroidal appearance take name call asteroids reserving however liberty changing name another expressive nature occur

1807 investigation revealed objects region juno vesta22 burning lilienthal napoleonic wars main body work done23 brought first period discovery close22
despite herschels coinage several decades remained common practice refer objects planets15 prefix names numbers representing date discovery ceres pallas juno vesta however 1845 astronomers detected fifth object astraea shortly thereafter objects found accelerating rate counting among planets became increasingly cumbersome eventually dropped planet list first suggested alexander humboldt early 1850s herschels choice nomenclature asteroids gradually came common use15
discovery neptune 1846 discrediting titius–bode eyes scientists orbit nowhere near predicted position date scientific explanation astronomers consensus regards coincidence24
