mammals inhalation rest primarily contraction diaphragm upwardly domed sheet muscle separates thoracic cavity abdominal cavity contracts sheet flattens moves downwards shown increasing volume thoracic cavity contracting diaphragm pushes abdominal organs downwards pelvic floor prevents lowermost abdominal organs moving direction pliable abdominal contents cause belly bulge outwards front sides relaxed abdominal muscles resist movement entirely passive bulging shrinking exhalation abdomen normal breathing sometimes referred abdominal breathing although fact diaphragmatic breathing visible outside body mammals abdominal muscles forceful exhalation discussion never form inhalation
diaphragm contracts cage simultaneously enlarged ribs pulled upwards intercostal muscles shown ribs slant downwards rear front shown lowermost ribs also slant downwards midline outwards thus cages transverse diameter increased anteroposterior diameter increase socalled pump handle movement shown

mechanism exchange


highly diagrammatic illustration process exchange mammalian lungs emphasizing differences compositions ambient alveolar light blue pulmonary capillary blood equilibrates blood tensions pulmonary arterial blue blood entering lung left venous blood blood leaving lung right tensions convert multiply

primary purpose respiratory system equilibration partial pressures respiratory gases alveolar pulmonary capillary blood process occurs simple diffusion17 across thin membrane known blood–air barrier forms walls pulmonary alveoli consisting alveolar epithelial cells basement membranes endothelial cells alveolar capillaries 1018 blood barrier extremely thin humans average thick folded million small sacs called alveoli18 diameter branching respiratory bronchioles lungs thus providing extremely large surface area approximately exchange occur18
contained within alveoli semipermanent volume 2530 liters completely surrounds alveolar capillary blood ensures equilibration partial pressures gases compartments efficient occurs quickly blood leaving alveolar capillaries eventually distributed throughout body therefore partial pressure oxygen 1314 mmhg partial pressure carbon dioxide mmhg oxygen carbon dioxide tensions alveoli6 mentioned section corresponding partial pressures oxygen carbon dioxide ambient level mmhg mmhg respectively6
marked difference composition alveolar ambient maintained functional residual capacity contained deadend sacs connected outside fairly narrow relatively long tubes airways nose pharynx larynx trachea bronchi branches bronchioles breathed unidirectional throughflow bird lung typical mammalian anatomy combined fact lungs emptied reinflated breath leaving substantial volume 2530 liters alveoli exhalation ensures composition alveolar minimally disturbed fresh mixed inhalation thus animal provided special portable atmosphere whose composition differs significantly presentday ambient air19 portable atmosphere functional residual capacity blood therefore body tissues exposed outside
resulting arterial partial pressures oxygen carbon dioxide homeostatically controlled rise arterial partial pressure lesser extent fall arterial partial pressure reflexly cause deeper faster breathing till blood tensions lungs therefore arterial blood return normal converse happens carbon dioxide tension falls lesser extent oxygen tension rises rate depth breathing reduced till blood normality restored
since blood arriving alveolar capillaries partial pressure average mmhg pressure alveolar 1314 mmhg diffusion oxygen capillary blood changing composition liters alveolar slightly similarly since blood arriving alveolar capillaries partial pressure also mmhg whereas alveolar mmhg movement carbon dioxide capillaries alveoli changes brought flows individual gases alveolar necessitate replacement alveolar ambient every seconds tightly controlled monitoring arterial blood gases accurately reflect composition alveolar aortic carotid bodies well blood sensor anterior surface medulla oblongata brain also oxygen carbon dioxide sensors lungs primarily determine diameters bronchioles pulmonary capillaries therefore responsible directing flow blood different parts lungs
