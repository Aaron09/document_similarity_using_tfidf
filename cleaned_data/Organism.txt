etymologyedit
term organism greek ὀργανισμός organismos ὄργανον organon instrument implement tool organ sense apprehension1011 first appeared english language 1703 took current definition 1834 oxford english dictionary directly related term organization long tradition defining organisms selforganizing beings going back least immanuel kants 1790 critique judgment12
definitionsedit
organism defined assembly molecules functioning less stable whole exhibits properties life dictionary definitions broad using phrases living structure plant animal fungus bacterium capable growth reproduction13 many definitions exclude viruses possible manmade nonorganic life forms viruses dependent biochemical machinery host cell reproduction14 superorganism organism consisting many individuals working together single functional social unit15
controversy best define organism161718192021222324 indeed whether definition necessary2526 several contributions27 responses suggestion category organism well adequate biology28page needed
noncellular lifeedit
main article noncellular life
viruses typically considered organisms incapable autonomous reproduction growth metabolism controversy problematic cellular organisms also incapable independent survival capable independent metabolism procreation live obligatory intracellular parasites although viruses enzymes molecules characteristic living organisms metabolism cannot synthesize organize organic compounds formed naturally rules autonomous reproduction passively replicated machinery host cell sense similar inanimate matter viruses sustain independent metabolism thus usually classified organisms genes evolve mechanisms similar evolutionary mechanisms organisms
common argument support viruses living organisms ability undergo evolution replicate selfassembly scientists argue viruses neither evolve self reproduce fact viruses evolved host cells meaning coevolution viruses host cells host cells exist viral evolution would impossible true cells viruses exist direction cellular evolution could different cells would nevertheless able evolve reproduction viruses totally rely hosts machinery replicate29 discovery viral megagenomes genes coding energy metabolism protein synthesis fueled debate whether viruses belong tree life presence genes suggested viruses able metabolize however found later genes coding energy protein metabolism cellular origin likely genes acquired horizontal gene transfer viral hosts29

organisms descended common ancestor ancestral gene pool evidence common descent found traits shared living organisms darwins evidence shared traits based solely visible observation morphologic similarities fact birds wings even
strong evidence genetics organisms common ancestor example every living cell makes nucleic acids genetic material uses twenty amino acids building blocks proteins organisms genetic code extremely rare minor deviations translate nucleic acid sequences proteins universality traits strongly suggests common ancestry selection many traits seems arbitrary horizontal gene transfer makes difficult study last universal ancestor37 however universal genetic code nucleotides amino acids makes existence ancestor overwhelmingly likely38

reproductionedit
main article reproduction
sexual reproduction widespread among current eukaryotes likely present last common ancestor49 suggested finding core genes meiosis descendants lineages diverged early form eukaryotic evolutionary tree50 malik al51 supported evidence eukaryotes previously regarded ancient asexuals amoeba likely sexual past present asexual amoeboid lineages likely arose recently independently52
prokaryotes natural bacterial transformation involves transfer bacterium another integration donor recipient chromosome recombination natural bacterial transformation considered primitive sexual process occurs bacteria archaea although studied mainly bacteria transformation clearly bacterial adaptation accidental occurrence depends numerous gene products specifically interact enter state natural competence perform complex process53 transformation common mode transfer among prokaryotes54
horizontal gene transferedit
main article horizontal gene transfer
ancestry living organisms traditionally reconstructed morphology increasingly supplemented phylogenetics—the reconstruction phylogenies comparison genetic sequence

sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer many genes among diverse species including across boundaries phylogenetic domains thus determining phylogenetic history species done conclusively determining evolutionary trees single genes55

biologist gogarten suggests original metaphor tree longer fits data recent genome research therefore biologists metaphor mosaic describe different histories combined individual genomes metaphor visualize rich exchange cooperative effects among microbes56
future life cloning synthetic organismsedit
modern biotechnology challenging traditional concepts organism species cloning process creating multicellular organism genetically identical another potential creating entirely species organisms cloning subject much ethical debate
2008 craig venter institute assembled synthetic bacterial genome mycoplasma genitalium using recombination yeast overlapping fragments single step yeast recombination greatly simplifies assembly large molecules synthetic natural fragments57 companies synthetic genomics already formed take advantage many commercial uses custom designed genomes
