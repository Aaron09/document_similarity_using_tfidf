international committee weights measures defined second duration periods radiation corresponding transition hyperfine levels ground state caesium atom3 adds obvious conclusion follows hyperfine splitting ground state caesium atom exactly hertz νhfs
english hertz also used plural form4 unit prefixed commonly used multiples kilohertz megahertz gigahertz terahertz 1012 hertz simply means cycle second typically counted complete cycle means hundred cycles second unit applied periodic event—for example clock might said tick human heart might said beat occurrence rate aperiodic stochastic events expressed reciprocal second inverse second general specific case radioactive decay becquerels5 whereas cycle second aperiodic radionuclide event second
even though angular velocity angular frequency unit hertz dimension angular velocity angular frequency expressed hertz6 rather appropriate angular unit radians second thus disc rotating revolutions minute said rotating either rads former measures angular velocity latter reflects number complete revolutions second conversion frequency measured hertz angular velocity measured radians second

historyedit
hertz named german physicist heinrich hertz 1857–1894 made important scientific contributions study electromagnetism name established international electrotechnical commission 19307 adopted general conference weights measures cgpm conférence générale poids mesures 1960 replacing previous name unit cycles second along related multiples primarily kilocycles second megacycles second occasionally kilomegacycles second kmcs term cycles second largely replaced hertz 1970s hobby magazine electronics illustrated declared intention stick traditional units8

vibrationedit
sound traveling longitudinal wave oscillation pressure humans perceive frequency sound waves pitch musical note corresponds particular frequency measured hertz infants able perceive frequencies ranging 20000 average adult human hear sounds 16000 range ultrasound infrasound physical vibrations molecular atomic vibrations extends femtohz10 terahertz range11 beyond
electromagnetic radiationedit
electromagnetic radiation often described frequency—the number oscillations perpendicular electric magnetic fields second—expressed hertz
radio frequency radiation usually measured kilohertz megahertz gigahertz light electromagnetic radiation even higher frequency frequencies range tens infrared thousands ultraviolet terahertz electromagnetic radiation frequencies terahertz range intermediate highest normally usable radio frequencies longwave infrared light often called terahertz radiation even higher frequencies exist gamma rays measured exahertz historical reasons frequencies light higher frequency electromagnetic radiation commonly specified terms wavelengths photon energies detailed treatment frequency ranges electromagnetic spectrum
computersedit
details frequency including gigahertz flawed speed indicator computers megahertz myth
computers central processing units labeled terms clock rate expressed megahertz gigahertz hertz respectively number refers frequency cpus master clock signal clock rate signal square wave electrical voltage switches high values regular intervals hertz become primary unit measurement accepted general populace determine performance many experts criticized approach claim easily manipulable benchmark processors multiple clock periods perform single operation others perform multiple operations single cycle12 homebased personal computers clock speeds ranged approximately late 1970s atari commodore apple computers power microprocessors
various computer buses frontside connecting northbridge also operate various frequencies megahertz range
speed correct term bandwidth networks including wireless wifi affected myth described general higher frequency allows higher possible bandwidth rates lowers time takes download large files general however higher frequencies pass walls making lower frequencies advantage indoors common equipment reports highest frequency available usually also works lower ones bandwidth often equated speed latency perceived problem measure distinct bandwidth higher bandwidth influence latency
