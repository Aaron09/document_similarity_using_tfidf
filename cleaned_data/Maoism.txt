modern chinese intellectual traditionedit
modern chinese intellectual tradition turn twentieth century defined central concepts iconoclasm nationalism1
iconoclastic revolutionanticonfucianismedit
turn twentieth century proportionately small socially significant crosssection chinas traditional elite landlords bureaucrats found increasingly skeptical efficacy even moral validity confucianism2 skeptical iconoclasts formed segment chinese society modern intelligentsia whose arrival historian china maurice meisner would label defection heralded beginning destruction gentry social class china3 fall last imperial chinese dynasty 1911 marked final failure confucian moral order much make confucianism synonymous political social conservatism minds chinese intellectuals association conservatism confucianism lent iconoclastic nature chinese intellectual thought first decades twentieth century4
chinese iconoclasm expressed clearly vociferously chen duxiu culture movement occurred 1915 19195 proposing total destruction traditions values past culture movement spearheaded youth periodical published chen duxiu profoundly influential young zedong whose first published work appeared magazines pages5
nationalism appeal marxismedit
along iconoclasm radical antiimperialism dominated chinese intellectual tradition slowly evolved fierce nationalist fervor influenced maos philosophy immensely crucial adapting marxism chinese model6 vital understanding chinese nationalist sentiments time treaty versailles signed 1919 treaty aroused wave bitter nationalist resentment chinese intellectuals lands formerly ceded germany shandong were—without consultation chinese—transferred japanese control rather returned chinese sovereignty7 negative reaction culminated incident occurred 1919 protest began 3000 students beijing displaying anger announcement versailles treatys concessions japan rapidly took violent turn protesters began attacking homes offices ministers seen cooperating direct japanese7 incident movement followed catalyzed political awakening society long seemed inert dormant7
another international event would large impact also chinese intelligentsia bolshevik revolution 1917 although revolution elicit interest among chinese intellectuals socialist revolution china considered viable option incident8 afterwards become marxist chinese intellectual reject traditions chinese past western domination chinese present8
yanan periodedit

maos intellectual marxist developmentedit
maos intellectual marxist development divided five major periods initial marxist period 1920–1926 formative maoist period 1927–1935 mature maoist period 1935–1940 civil period 1940–1949 post1949 period following revolutionary victory

initial marxist period 1920–1926 marxist thinking employs imminent socioeconomic explanations maos reasons declarations enthusiasm believe education alone would bring transition capitalism communism three main reasons psychologically capitalists would repent turn towards communism rulers must overthrown people proletarians discontented demand communism arisen already become fact10 reasons provide socioeconomic explanations usually form core marxist ideology
formative maoist period 1927–1935 period avoided theoretical implications literature employed minimum marxist category thought writings period failed elaborate meant marxist method political class analysis11 prior period concerned dichotomy knowledge action concerned dichotomy revolutionary ideology counterrevolutionary objective conditions correlation drawn china soviet model
mature maoist period 1935–1940 intellectually maos fruitful time shift orientation apparent pamphlet strategic problems chinas revolutionary december 1936 pamphlet tried provide theoretical veneer concern revolutionary practice12 started separate soviet model since automatically applicable china chinas unique historical circumstances demanded correspondingly unique application marxist theory application would diverge soviet approach
civilwar period 1940–1949 unlike mature period period intellectually barren focused revolutionary practice paid less attention marxist theory continued emphasize theory practiceoriented knowledge13 biggest topic theory delved connection cheng feng movement 1942 summarized correlation marxist theory chinese practice target chinese revolution arrow marxism–leninism chinese communists seek arrow purpose target chinese revolution revolution east13 emphasis maos concern types subjectivist deviation dogmatism excessive reliance upon abstract theory empiricism excessive dependence experience

cultural revolutionedit
theory cultural revolution states proletarian revolution dictatorship proletariat wipe bourgeois ideology—the classstruggle continues even intensifies socialism therefore constant struggle ideologies social roots must conducted cultural revolution directed also traditionalism
contradictionedit
zedong drew writings karl marx friedrich engels vladimir lenin elaborating theory philosophically important reflections emerge concept contradiction maodun major essays contradiction correct handling contradictions among people adopts positivistempiricist idea shared engels contradiction present matter thus also ideas brain matter always develops dialectical contradiction interdependence contradictory aspects present things struggle aspects determine life things push development forward nothing contain contradiction without contradiction nothing would exist20
furthermore contradiction including class struggle contradiction holding relations production concrete development forces production expresses series contradictions dominant others many contradictions process development complex thing necessarily principal contradiction whose existence development determine influence existence development contradictions21
thus principal contradiction tackled priority trying make basic contradiction solidify elaborates theme essay practice relation knowledge practice knowing practice connects contradiction class struggle following inside mode production three realms practice functions economic production scientific experimentation also takes place economic production radically disconnected former finally class struggle considered proper objects economy scientific knowledge politics22
three spheres deal matter various forms socially mediated result realms knowledge arise since truth knowledge make sense relation matter according marxist epistemology emphasizes—like marx trying confront bourgeois idealism time—that knowledge must based empirical evidence
knowledge results hypotheses verified contrast real object real object despite mediated subjects theoretical frame retains materiality offer resistance ideas conform truth thus realms economic scientific political practice contradictions principle secondary must identified explored function achieve communist goal involves need know scientifically masses produce live think work obtain knowledge class struggle main contradiction articulates mode production various realms expresses
