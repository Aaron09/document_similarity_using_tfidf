history
early timekeeping
clocks first invented common practice mark time apparent solar time also called true solar time example time sundial typically different every location dependent longitude
wellregulated mechanical clocks became widespread early 19th century1 city began local mean solar time apparent mean solar time differ around minutes described equation time elliptical shape earths orbit around eccentricity tilt earths axis obliquity mean solar time days equal length difference sums zero year
greenwich mean time established 1675 royal observatory built mariners determine longitude providing standard reference time city england kept different local time
railway time




plaque commemorating railway general time convention 1883 north america


local solar time became increasingly inconvenient rail transport telecommunications improved clocks differed places amounts corresponding differences geographical longitudes varied four minutes time every degree longitude example bristol degrees west greenwich east london solar noon bristol minutes past solar noon london2 time zones accumulates differences longer units usually hours nearby places share common standard timekeeping
first adoption standard time december 1847 great britain railway companies using kept portable chronometers first companies adopt standard time great western railway november 1840 quickly became known railway time august 1852 time signals first transmitted telegraph royal observatory greenwich even though great britains public clocks using 1855 made britains legal time august 1880 british clocks period minute hands—one local time gmt3
improvements worldwide communication increased need interacting parties communicate mutually comprehensible time references another problem differing local times could solved across larger areas synchronizing clocks worldwide many places adopted time would differ markedly solar time people accustomed
november 1868 british colony zealand officially adopted standard time observed throughout colony perhaps first country based longitude 172°30′ east greenwich hours minutes ahead standard known zealand mean time4

ideal time zones nautical time zones based mean solar time particular meridian located middle zone boundaries located degrees east west meridian practice zone boundaries often drawn much farther west often irregular boundaries locations base time meridians located east
example even though prime meridian passes spain france mean solar time degrees east central european time rather degrees greenwich mean time france previously used switched central european time german occupation country world switch back war15 similarly prior world netherlands observed amsterdam time twenty minutes ahead greenwich mean time obliged follow german time kept thereafter 1970s netherlands european states began observing daylight saving summer time
tendency draw time zone boundaries west meridians main reason similar working schedules around world people rising average 0700 clock time going 2300 clock timecitation needed another reason allow efficient sunlight16 means middle period people awake awake time noon occurs 1500 clock time whereas using clock time time nautical time zone location concerned geographically belongs solar noon occurs 1200 clock time make solar noon coincide awake time noon make reach highest point closer 1500 clock time rather 1200 clock time time even nautical time zones east chosencitation needed many locations also adding another nautical time zone east resultnote summer solar noon spanish town muxía occurs 1437 clock time indeed close awake time noon 1500 westernmost area continental spain never experiences sunset 1800 clock time even midwinter despite lying degrees north equator near summer solstice muxia sunset times 2200 similar stockholm time zone degrees north stockholm much earlier sunrises though

daylight saving time
main article daylight saving time
many countries sometimes certain regions countries adopt daylight saving time also known summer time part year typically involves advancing clocks hour near start spring adjusting back autumn spring forward fall back modern first proposed 1907 widespread 1916 wartime measure aimed conserving coal despite controversy many countries used since details vary location change occasionally countries around equator observe daylight saving time since seasonal difference sunlight minimal
computer systems internet
computer operating systems include necessary support working almost possible local times based various time zones internally operating systems typically basic timekeeping standard providing services converting local times also ability automatically change local time conversions start daylight saving time various time zones article daylight saving time details aspect
servers presenting pages primarily audience single time zone limited range time zones typically show times local time perhaps time brackets internationally oriented websites show times using arbitrary time zone example international englishlanguage version includes hong kong time18 whereas version shows eastern time19 eastern time pacific time also used fairly commonly many usbased englishlanguage websites global readership format typically based note datetime
email systems messaging systems chat etc20 timestamp messages using else include senders time zone part message allowing receiving program display messages date time sending recipients local time
database records include time stamp typically especially database part system spans multiple time zones local time timestamping records recommended time zones implement daylight saving time year onehour period local times ambiguous
calendar systems nowadays usually time stamps show differently computers different time zones works telephone internet meetings works less well travelling calendar events assumed take place time zone computer smartphone creating event event shown wrong time example yorker plans meet someone angeles makes calendar entry computer assumes york time calendar entry taking computers time zone also option newer versions microsoft outlook enter time zone event happen often calendar systems calendaring software must also deal daylight saving time political reasons begin dates daylight saving time changed calendar entries stay local time even though shift time microsoft outlook time stamps therefore stored communicated without offsets21 hence appointment london noon summer represented 1200 utc0000 even though event actually take place 1300 google calendar calendar events stored although shown local time might changed timezone changes22 although normal daylight saving start compensated similar much calendar software
