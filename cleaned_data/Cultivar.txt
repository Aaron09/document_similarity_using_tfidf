liberty hyde bailey 1858–1954 coined words cultigen 1918 cultivar 1923



main article cultivated plant taxonomy
word cultivar originated need distinguish wild plants characteristics arose cultivation presently denominated cultigens distinction dates greek philosopher theophrastus 370–285 father botany keenly aware difference botanical historian alan morton noted theophrastus historia plantarum enquiry plants inkling limits culturally induced phenotypic changes importance genetic constitution historia plantarum book causa plantarum book
international code nomenclature algae fungi plants uses starting point modern botanical nomenclature latin names linnaeus 1707–1778 species plantarum tenth edition genera plantarum fifth edition species plantarum linnaeus enumerated plants known either directly extensive reading recognised rank varietas botanical variety rank species subspecies indicated varieties letters greek alphabet varietal name rather using abbreviation present convention varieties linnaeus enumerated garden origin rather wild plants7
time need distinguish wild plants variations cultivated increased nineteenth century many gardenderived plants given horticultural names sometimes latin sometimes vernacular language circa 1900s cultivated plants europe recognised scandinavian germanic slavic literature stamm sorte8 words could used internationally international agreement denominations latin9 twentieth century improved international nomenclature proposed cultivated plants10
liberty hyde bailey cornell university york united states created word cultivar 1923 wrote

cultigen species equivalent appeared domestication plant cultigenous propose another name cultivar botanical variety race subordinate species originated cultivation necessarily however referable recognized botanical species essentially equivalent botanical variety except respect origin1

essay bailey used rank species cultigen obvious many domesticated plants like botanical varieties species realization appears motivated suggestion category cultivar
bailey created word cultivar generally assumed portmanteau cultivated variety bailey never explicitly stated etymology cultivar suggested instead contraction cultigen variety seems correct11 neologism cultivar promoted euphonious free ambiguity8nb first cultivated plant code 1953 subsequently commended 1960 achieved common international acceptance12

cultivar assemblage plants selected particular character combination characters distinct uniform stable characters propagated appropriate means retains characters18

different kindsedit




cultivar orchid genus oncidium



plants chosen named cultivars simply matter convenience category created serve practical needs horticulture agriculture forestry19
members particular cultivar necessarily genetically identical cultivated plant code emphasizes different cultivated plants accepted different cultivars even genome cultivated plants different genomes regarded cultivar production cultivars generally entails considerable human involvement although cases little simply selecting variation plants growing wild whether collecting growing tissue propagate gathering seed20
cultivars generally occur ornamentals food crops malus granny smith malus delicious cultivars apples propagated cuttings grafting lactuca sails lactuca great lakes lettuce cultivars propagated seeds named cultivars hosta hemerocallis plants cultivars produced micropropagation division
clonesedit

seedproducededit
cultivars come true seed retaining distinguishing characteristics grown seed plants termed variety selection strain ambiguous confusing words best avoided general asexually propagated cultivars grown seeds produce highly variable seedling plants labelled sold parent cultivars name22
seedraised cultivars produced uncontrolled pollination characteristics distinct uniform stable passed parents progeny produced lines produced repeated selffertilization inbreeding multilines made several closely related lines sometimes hybrids result deliberate repeatable single cross pure lines hybrid seed cultivars also exist achillea summer berries
cultivars agamospermous plants retain genetic composition characteristics reproduction23 occasionally cultivars raised seed specially selected provenance example seed taken plants resistant particular disease24
genetically modifiededit
main article genetic engineering
genetically modified plants characteristics resulting deliberate implantation genetic material different germplasm form cultivar however international code nomenclature cultivated plants notes practice assemblage often marketed lines multilines genetically modified lines multilines often remain constant state development makes naming assemblage cultivar futile exercise however retired transgenic varieties fish tomato longer developed obstacle given cultivar name
cultivars selected change ploidy level plant produce desirable characteristics
