united statesedit
united states communications 1934 requires “the commission shall make distribution licenses frequencies hours operation power among several states communities provide fair efficient equitable distribution radio service same”2 federal communications commission interprets requiring every broadcast station licensed principal community political subdivision primarily serves”3 broadcast service defines standard means serve community example commercial radio stations required provide electric field least millivolts meter entire land area community4 whereas noncommercial educational stations need provide field strength communitys population5 electric field contour called “principal community contour”
federal communications commission makes requirements stations relative communities license requirements varied time example requirement stations identify call sign community signon signoff every hour operation6 current requirements include providing local telephone number communitys calling area else tollfree number7 cases maintaining official main studio within miles communitys geographic center8
policy regulatory issuesedit
nominal main studio requirementsedit
requirement station maintain main studio within stations primary coverage area within maximum distance community license originated stations legally required generate local content majority stations local nonnetwork programming expected originate central studio location context view broadcast regulators held expedient ensure content broadcast reflected needs local community allocate local broadcast stations studios individual city
nominal main studio requirement become less relevant introduction videotape recorders 1956 allowed local content easily generated offsite transported stations growing portability broadcastquality production equipment transistorization elimination requirements 1987 classes broadcast stations broadcasters originate minimum amount local content






article section possibly contains previously unpublished synthesis published material conveys ideas attributable original sources relevant discussion found talk page april 2010 learn remove template message



main studio concept nominally remains broadcast regulations certain administrative requirements local employment manager equivalent least fulltime staff member well maintenance public inspection file still applied removal requirement stations originate local content greatly weakens significance maintaining local main studio facility capable originating programming feeding transmitter must still exist normal conditions often requirement local studio actually active originate specific local programming
many cases centralcasting broadcast automation greatly weakened role importance manual control staff nominal local station studio facilities
exceptions rules made regulators primarily casebycase basis deal satellite stations transmitters licensed comply technical requirements full service broadcast facilities independent call signs communities license used simply fullpower broadcast translators rebroadcast another station often noncommercial educational stations stations serving thinly populated areas otherwise would small support independent local fullservice broadcaster9
political considerationsedit
requirement fullservice station maintain local presence community license used proponents localism community broadcasting means oppose construction local stations mere rebroadcasters satellitefed translators distant stations without specific requirements service local community license stations could constructed large number outofregion broadcasters feed transmitters satellite offer local content10
also facto preference regulators encourage assignment broadcast licenses smaller cities otherwise would local voice instead allowing broadcast activity concentrated large metropolitan areas already served many existing broadcasters
dealing multiple competing radio station applications current allotment priorities first fulltime aural service second fulltime aural service first local aural transmission service public interest matters11
similar criteria extended competing applicants noncommercial stations legislation passed 200012
suburban community problemedit
policy favoring applicants communities already served existing station unintended effect encouraging applicants merely list small suburb large city claiming first station community even though larger city well served many existing stations suburban community problem recognized policy early 1965 stations metropolitan areas often tend seek national regional advertisers identify entire metropolitan area rather particular needs specified communities according policy statement order discourage applicants smaller communities would merely substandard stations neighboring larger communities established socalled suburban community presumption required applicants stations markets demonstrate ascertained unmet programming needs specific communities prepared satisfy needs13
1969 issues spread licensing instead building transmitters community nominally served applicants would often seek locate tower site least halfway next major city precedent case berwick doctrine required hearing berwick prospective broadcaster could locate transmitters midway pittston pennsylvania city license larger audience wilkesbarre14
related problem movein outlying communities would find smalltown local stations sold outsiders would attempt change community license suburb nearest major city move transmitter locations remove existing local content broadcasts attempt move larger city
small town anniston alabama location miles west atlanta miles east birmingham lost local content stations retargeted larger urban centers moved outright whmafm anniston licensed wnnx college park georgia atlanta suburb failed attempt relicense sandy springs georgia another atlanta suburb transmitters downtown atlanta15 true wjsu served east alabama local news station merged triplex form 3340 focuses coverage central part state
1988 precedent case faye richard tuck 5374 1988 created tuck analysis standard attempts address suburban community problem casebycase basis examining

station’s proposed signal coverage urbanized area “coverage factor”
relative population size distance suburban community urban market “relative size distance factor”
independence suburban community based various factors would indicate selfsufficiency “independence factor”

despite best intentions regulators system remains prone manipulation

almost become parlor game goal game—whether you’re applying station station currently licensed rural area—is move close market possible closer market potential listeners reach hence advertising dollars attract there’s catch—at least there’s supposed commission required section 307b communications provide fair efficient equitable distribution radio service” “the several states communities” cannot simply permit radio stations relocate rural areas wellserved urban markets without violating mandate that’s game gets interesting allotment rules commission give preference applicant proposes serve community current licensees—ie community doesn’t receive radio service could receive service dozens stations station lists particular community “community license” that’s good atlas comes handy next step scour maps find community near urban area doesn’t stations licensed game grant preference providing “first service” closein suburban community able cover larger market

licensing onair identityedit
becoming less meaningful decades stations still required post public file somewhere within miles city cover entire city local signal united states stations transmitter must located provide strong signal nearly principal community stronger night stations dbuv channels channels channels even primarily serves another city17 example american television station wttv primarily serves indianapolis however transmitter located farther south stations city licensed bloomington miles south indianapolis cases jeannette pennsylvanialicensed wpcw waived requirement station claimed retaining existing transmitter site miles southeast community license jeannette would compliance commissions minimum distance separation requirements avoiding interference cochannel woio shaker heights18 another extreme example stations transmitter located city license station kpnt licensed town collinsville station primarily serves greater louis area well numerous outlying communities south louis near illinois border stations transmitter actually located near hillsboro away community license collinsville
regulations also require stations least hour state stations call letters followed city license however restrictions additional names city license many stations afterwards nearest large city example american television station woio licensed shaker heights suburb cleveland identified woio shaker heightscleveland similarly northern yorks wwny identifies wwnytv carthagewatertown historical artifact original broadcasts originated champion hill 1954 license still reflects tiny location
station licensed primary city served occasion station list second city next example american television station wtvt licensed tampa florida primary city identifies wtvtwtvtdt tampast petersburg petersburg another major city market
longer requirement carry programs relevant particular communitycitation needed even necessarily operate transmit community accordingly stations licensed smaller communities major metropolitan markets often target programming toward entire market rather official home community often move studio facilities larger urban centre well instance canadian radio station cfnyfm officially licensed brampton ontario although studio transmitter facilities located downtown toronto
times lead confusion media directories normally list broadcast stations legal community license audiences often disregard even entirely unaware distinction
table allotmentsedit
united states federal communications commission maintains table allotments assigns individual channel frequencies individual cities communities radio19
corresponding table allotments digital television created 199720 operate licensed station broadcaster must first obtain allocation desired frequencies fccs table allotments intended city license process subject various political bureaucratic restrictions based considerations including number existing stations area
term city cases relaxed mean community often including unincorporated areas around city share mailing address sometimes leads inconsistencies licensing metro atlanta station unincorporated cobb county community mableton refusal license another sandy springs21 largest cities state time unincorporated part fulton county political reasons georgia general assemblycitation needed
definition community also comes play broadcaster wants take station away tiny hamlet like north pole york whose population decline general regulators loath allow communitys licence moved away especially city already station rare exceptions made accommodate thenfledgling thirdrank american broadcasting company 1950s broadcaster make case community functionally longer exists order released local obligations
often city license correspond location station primary audience communities identified stations branding advertising
common reasons community license listed point actual audience include

compromise location
broadcaster wish serve different communities region enough transmitter market would provide poor service transmitter community served would preferable occasionally station licensed small town larger centres used
