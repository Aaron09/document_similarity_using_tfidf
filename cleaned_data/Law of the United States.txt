united states derived five sources constitutional statutory treaties administrative regulations common includes case law17
constitutionalityedit
congress enacts statute conflicts constitution supreme court find unconstitutional declare invalid18
notably statute disappear automatically merely found unconstitutional must deleted subsequent statute many federal state statutes remained books decades ruled unconstitutional however principle stare decisis sensible lower court enforce unconstitutional statute court reversed supreme court19 conversely court refuses enforce constitutional statute constitutionality expressly established prior cases risk reversal supreme court2021
american common lawedit
united states commonwealth countries heirs common legal tradition english law22 certain practices traditionally allowed english common expressly outlawed constitution bills attainder23 general search warrants24
common courts courts inherited principle stare decisis25 american judges like common judges elsewhere apply also make extent decisions cases become precedent decisions future cases26
actual substance english formally received united states several ways first states except louisiana enacted reception statutes generally state common england particularly judgemade state extent repugnant domestic indigenous conditions27 reception statutes impose specific cutoff date reception date colonys founding others deliberately vague28 thus contemporary courts often cite prerevolution cases discussing evolution ancient judgemade common principle modern form28 heightened duty care traditionally imposed upon common carriers29
second small number important british statutes effect time revolution independently reenacted states examples many lawyers recognize statute frauds still widely known name statute elizabeth ancestor uniform fraudulent transfer english statutes still regularly cited contemporary american cases interpreting modern american descendants30
however important understand despite presence reception statutes much contemporary american common diverged significantly english common law31 reason although courts various commonwealth nations often influenced others rulings american courts rarely follow postrevolution commonwealth rulings unless american ruling point facts issue nearly identical reasoning strongly persuasive
early american courts even revolution often cite contemporary english cases appellate decisions many american courts regularly reported mid19th century lawyers judges creatures habit used english legal materials fill gap32 citations english decisions gradually disappeared 19th century american courts developed principles resolve legal problems american people33 number published volumes american reports soared eighteen 1810 8000 191034 1879 delegates california constitutional convention already complaining require state reasons decision mean shall write hundred pages detail mean shall include small cases impose country fine judicial literature lord knows enough already35
today words stanford professor lawrence friedman american cases rarely cite foreign materials courts occasionally cite british classic famous case blackstone current british almost never gets mention36 foreign never cited binding precedent reflection shared values angloamerican civilization even western civilization general37

unlike situation states plenary reception statute federal level continued common thereby granted federal courts power formulate legal precedent like english predecessors federal courts solely creatures federal constitution federal judiciary acts41 however universally accepted founding fathers united states vesting judicial power supreme court inferior federal courts article three united states constitution thereby vested implied judicial power common courts formulate persuasive precedent power widely accepted understood recognized founding fathers time constitution ratified42 several legal scholars argued federal judicial power decide cases controversies necessarily includes power decide precedential effect cases controversies43
difficult question whether federal judicial power extends formulating binding precedent strict adherence rule stare decisis deciding case becomes limited form lawmaking appellate courts rulings thereby bind lower courts future cases therefore also impliedly binds persons within courts jurisdiction prior major change federal court rules 2007 onefifth federal appellate cases published thereby became binding precedents rest unpublished bound parties case42
federal judge alex kozinski pointed binding precedent know today simply exist time constitution framed42 judicial decisions consistently accurately faithfully reported sides atlantic reporters often simply rewrote failed publish decisions disliked united kingdom lacked coherent court hierarchy prior 19th century42 furthermore english judges eighteenth century subscribed nowobsolete natural theories believed existence independent individual judges said judges merely declaring always theoretically existed making law42 therefore judge could reject another judges opinion simply incorrect statement scientists regularly reject others conclusions incorrect statements laws science42
turn according kozinskis analysis contemporary rule binding precedent became possible nineteenth century creation clear court hierarchy judiciary acts beginning regular verbatim publication appellate decisions west publishing42 rule gradually developed casebycase extension judiciarys public policy effective judicial administration order efficiently exercise judicial power42 rule precedent generally justified today matter public policy first matter fundamental fairness second absence case would completely unworkable every minor issue every legal case briefed argued decided first principles relevant statutes constitutional provisions underlying public policies turn would create hopeless inefficiency instability unpredictability thereby undermine rule law4445
typical exposition public policy 2008 majority opinion signed associate justice stephen breyer

justice brandeis observed matters important applicable rule settled settled right burnet coronado overturn decision settling matter simply might believe decision longer right would inevitably reflect willingness reconsider others willingness could threaten substitute disruption confusion uncertainty necessary legal stability found factors might overcome considerations46

sometimes possible time line precedents drift express language underlying statutory constitutional texts courts decisions establish doctrines considered texts drafters trend strongly evident federal substantive process47 commerce clause decisions48 originalists political conservatives associate justice antonin scalia criticized trend antidemocratic49505152
doctrine erie railroad tompkins 1938 general federal common although federal courts create federal common form case must linked another interpretation particular federal constitutional provision statute regulation turn enacted part constitution federal courts lack plenary power possessed state courts simply make latter able absence constitutional statutory provisions replacing common narrow limited areas like maritime law53 constitution expressly authorized continuation english common federal level meaning areas federal courts continue make subject limitations stare decisis
major implication erie doctrine federal courts cannot dictate content state federal issue thus federal supremacy issue case54 hearing claims state pursuant diversity jurisdiction federal trial courts must apply statutory decisional state court state55 even believe relevant state irrational public policy56 erie deference oneway state courts bound federal interpretations state law57

criminal procedureedit
main articles united states criminal united states criminal procedure
criminal involves prosecution state wrongful acts considered serious breach sovereigns peace cannot deterred remedied mere lawsuits private parties generally crimes result incarceration torts cannot majority crimes committed united states prosecuted punished state level federal criminal focuses areas specifically relevant federal government like evading payment federal income mail theft physical attacks federal officials well interstate crimes like drug trafficking wire fraud
states somewhat similar laws regard higher crimes felonies murder rape although penalties crimes vary state state capital punishment permitted states others three strikes laws certain states impose harsh penalties repeat offenders
states distinguish levels felonies misdemeanors minor crimes generally felony convictions result lengthy prison sentences well subsequent probation large fines orders restitution directly victims misdemeanors lead year less jail substantial fine simplify prosecution traffic violations relatively minor crimes states added third level infractions result fines sometimes loss ones drivers license jail time
public welfare offenses state punishing merely risky opposed injurious behavior significant diversity across various states example punishments drunk driving varied greatly prior 1990 state laws dealing drug crimes still vary widely states treating possession small amounts drugs misdemeanor offense medical issue others categorizing offense serious felony
criminal procedure united states consists massive overlay federal constitutional case interwoven federal state statutes actually provide foundation creation operation enforcement agencies prison systems well proceedings criminal trials perennial inability legislatures enact statutes would actually force enforcement officers respect constitutional rights criminal suspects convicts federal judiciary gradually developed exclusionary rule method enforce rights71 turn exclusionary rule spawned family judgemade remedies abuse enforcement powers famous miranda warning writ habeas corpus often used suspects convicts challenge detention civil rights 1871 bivens actions used suspects recover tort damages police brutality

thirtyfive states adopted rules civil procedure modeled frcp including rule numbers however make modifications account fact state courts broad general jurisdiction federal courts relatively limited jurisdiction
york illinois california significant states adopted frcp furthermore three states continue maintain civil procedure laws form codified statutes enacted state legislature opposed court rules promulgated state supreme court ground latter undemocratic certain portions civil procedure laws modified legislatures bring closer federal civil procedure72
generally american civil procedure several notable features including extensive pretrial discovery heavy reliance live testimony obtained deposition elicited front jury aggressive pretrial motion practice designed result pretrial disposition summary judgment settlement courts pioneered concept optout class action burden falls class members notify court wish bound judgment opposed optin class actions class members must join class another unique feature socalled american rule parties generally bear attorneys fees opposed english rule loser pays though american legislators courts carved numerous exceptions
