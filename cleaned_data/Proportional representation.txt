advantages disadvantages
case proportional representation made john stuart mill 1861 essay considerations representative government

representative body actually deliberating minority must course overruled equal democracy majority people representatives outvote prevail minority representatives follow minority representatives necessary minority even heard nothing habit association reconcile reasonable needless injustice really equal democracy every section would represented disproportionately proportionately majority electors would always majority representatives minority electors would always minority representatives would fully represented majority unless equal government part whose fair equal share influence representation withheld contrary government contrary principle democracy professes equality root foundation1

many academic political theorists agree mill11 representative democracy representatives represent segments society
fairness
tries resolve unfairness majoritarian plurality voting systems largest parties receive unfair seat bonus smaller parties disadvantaged difficulty winning representation duvergers law12136–7 established parties elections formal control parliament little votes 2005 general election certain canadian elections majority governments formed parties support votes cast 2011 canadian election 2015 canadian election turnout levels electorate less outcomes allow party form majority government convincing quarter electorate vote 2005 election example labour party tony blair comfortable parliamentary majority votes total electorate143 misrepresentation criticized longer question fairness elementary rights citizens1522 however systems high electoral threshold features reduce proportionality necessarily much fairer turkish general election 2002 using open list system threshold votes wasted383
pluralitymajoritarian systems also disproportionately benefit regional parties districts strong following parties national support strongholds like greens seats example bloc québécois canada seats 1993 federal election quebec national vote progressive conservatives collapsed seats spread nationally1316 similarly 2015 general election scottish national party gained seats scotland share national vote independence party gained single seat17
election minor parties
multiplemember districts enables greater variety candidates elected representatives district lower minimum threshold votes required election minor parties gain representation argued emerging democracies inclusion minorities legislature essential social stability consolidate democratic process358
critics hand claim give extreme parties foothold parliament sometimes cited cause collapse weimar government thresholds small parties kingmakers18 holding larger parties ransom coalition discussions example israel often quoted359 problems limited modern german bundestag introduction higher threshold limits party gain parliamentary representation
another criticism dominant parties pluralitymajoritarian systems often looked coalitions broad churches19 fragment election candidates smaller groups becomes possible israel brazil italy examples35989 however research shows general marginal increase number parties parliament20
open list systems prominent system require political parties21 enable independent candidates elected ireland average independent candidates elected parliament22
coalitions
election smaller parties gives rise principal objections systems almost always result coalition governments35911
supporters coalitions advantage forcing compromise parties form coalition centre political spectrum leading continuity stability opponents counter many policies compromise possible example funding stealth bomber leaving neither many policies easily positioned leftright spectrum example environment policies horsetraded coalition formation consequence voters knowing policies pursued government elect voters less influence governments also coalitions necessarily form centre small parties excessive influence supplying coalition majority condition policy policies favoured voters isare adopted importantly ability voters vote party disfavour power curtailed11
disadvantages opponents contend avoided twoparty plurality systems coalitions rare dominant parties necessarily compete centre votes governments reliably moderate strong opposition necessary proper scrutiny government assured governments remain sensitive public sentiment regularly voted power11 however experience shows necessarily twoparty system result drift extremes hollowing centre23 least party drifting extreme24
nevertheless studies found average compared countries using plurality systems governments elected accord closely median voter citizens content democracy20
voter participation
plurality systems usually result singleparty government relatively votes finely balanced districts swing seats transfer sufficient seats opposition swing election partisan districts remain invulnerable swings political mood example half constituencies always elected party since 194525 2012 house elections districts districts uncontested dominant parties26 voters know preferred candidate cannot little incentive vote vote effect wasted310
swing seats votes contribute election candidate parties need campaign districts support strongest perceive advantage fact turn encourages parties responsive voters producing balanced ticket nominating women minority candidates13 average women elected20
since votes count fewer wasted votes voters aware vote make difference likely make effort vote less likely vote tactically compared countries plurality electoral systems voter turnout improves population involved political process31320 however experts argue transitioning plurality increases voter turnout geographical areas associated safe seats plurality system turnout decrease areas formerly associated swing seats27
gerrymandering
ensure approximately equal representation plurality systems dependent drawing boundaries singlemember districts process vulnerable political interference gerrymandering compound problem boundaries periodically redrawn accommodate population changes even apolitically drawn boundaries unintentionally produce effect gerrymandering reflecting naturally occurring concentrations2865 systems multiplemember districts less prone research suggests fiveseat districts immune gerrymandering2866 district boundaries less critical aligned historical boundaries cities counties states provinces population changes accommodated simply adjusting number representatives elected example professor mollison 2010 plan upper limit 100000 electors constituency 500000 electors would five seats 1100000 500001 seats 183000 district boundaries follow historical county local authority boundaries achieves uniform representation boundary commission body responsible balancing firstpastthepost constituency sizes2529
mixed member systems susceptible gerrymandering local seats remain part systems parallel voting semiproportional system compensation effects gerrymandering might compensatory list seats makes gerrymandering less issue however effectiveness regard depends upon features system including size regional districts relative share list seats total opportunities collusion might exist striking example compensatory mechanism undermined seen 2014 hungarian parliamentary election leading party fidesz combined gerrymandering decoy lists resulted twothirds parliamentary majority vote3031 illustrates certain implementations produce moderately proportional outcomes similar parallel voting
link constituent representative
generally accepted particular advantage plurality electoral systems first past post majoritarian electoral systems alternative vote geographic link representatives constituents33632651521 notable disadvantage multiplemember districts made larger link weakened382 party list systems without delineated districts netherlands israel geographic link representatives constituents considered extremely weak relatively small multiplemember districts particular counterarguments voters consult representative voted someone might think sympathetic problem cases sometimes argued constituents representatives closer link2528212 constituents choice representative consult particular expertise topic issue2821233 multiplemember districts prominent candidates opportunity elected home constituencies know represent authentically less likely strong incentive parachute constituencies strangers thus less ideal representatives34248–250 mixedmember systems incorporate singlemember districts preserve link constituents representatives395 however half parliamentary seats list rather district seats districts necessarily twice large pluralitymajoritarian system representatives serve singlemember districts1532
wider benefits society
wider benefits identified societies using compared using fptp including higher scores human development index measure health education personal security higher economic growth less inequality better environmental protection20
attributes systems
district magnitude
academics agree important influence proportionality electoral districts magnitude number representatives elected district proportionality improves magnitude increases3 scholars recommend voting districts roughly four eight seats considered small relative systems general35
extreme chilean binomial voting electoral system nominally proportional openlist system uses twomember districts resulting election candidate dominant political blocks cannot considered proportional379
district encompasses entire country minimum threshold highly proportionate representation political parties result parties gain broadening appeal nominating minority women candidates383
introduction ireland 1921 district magnitudes slowly diminished threemember constituencies defined benefiting dominant fianna fáil 1979 independent boundary commission established reversing trend36 2010 parliamentary constitutional committee recommended minimum magnitude four37 nonetheless despite relatively magnitudes ireland generally experienced highly proportional results373
fairvote plan fairvote calls choice voting house representatives three fivemember superdistricts proposed38 professor mollisons plan four fivemember districts used three necessary existing boundaries25
minimum threshold
minimum threshold minimum vote required seat lower threshold higher proportion votes contributing election representatives lower proportion votes wasted3
electoral systems thresholds either formally defined mathematical consequence parameters election383
formal threshold usually requires parties certain percentage vote order awarded seats party lists germany zealand threshold national vote threshold applied parties minimum number constituency seats three germany zealand turkey defines threshold netherlands 0673 israel raised threshold 1992 2004 2006 201439
elections winning quota ballotsseats1 first preference votes assures election however well regarded candidates attract good second third preference support hope election half quota first preference votes thus sixseat district effective threshold would first preference votes 10061225 need attract second preferences tends promote consensus disadvantage extremes
party magnitude
party magnitude number candidates elected party district party magnitude increases balanced ticket successful encouraging parties nominate women minority candidates election40
nominating many candidates counterproductive splitting firstpreference votes allowing candidates eliminated receiving transferred votes parties example identified ward 2007 scottish local elections labour putting three candidates seat might voters preferred candidates stood25 effect contributed collapse fianna fáil 2011 irish general election41

measuring proportionality
number ways measuring proportionality proposed including loosemore–hanby index gallagher index saintelaguë index metrics actually quantify disproportionality election degree number seats party differs perfectly proportional outcome example canadian parliaments 2016 special committee electoral reform recommended system designed achieve gallagher score less indicated much higher degree proportionality observed 2015 canadian election firstpastthepost voting gallagher index 1210
loosemorehanby index calculated subtracting partys vote share seat share adding absolute values ignoring negative signs dividing two424–6
gallagher index similar involves squaring difference party’s vote share seat share taking square root
saintelaguë index discrepancy party’s vote share seat share measured relative vote share
none metrics loosemorehanby gallagher saintelaguë fully support ranked voting4344
