signs symptomsedit
hypertension rarely accompanied symptoms identification usually screening seeking healthcare unrelated problem high blood pressure report headaches particularly back head morning well lightheadedness vertigo tinnitus buzzing hissing ears altered vision fainting episodes19 symptoms however might related associated anxiety rather high blood pressure itself20

secondary hypertensionedit
main article secondary hypertension
hypertension certain specific additional signs symptoms suggest secondary hypertension hypertension identifiable cause example cushings syndrome frequently causes truncal obesity glucose intolerance moon face hump behind neckshoulder referred buffalo hump purple abdominal stretch marks22 hyperthyroidism frequently causes weight loss increased appetite fast heart rate bulging eyes tremor renal artery stenosis associated localized abdominal bruit left right midline unilateral locations bilateral coarctation aorta frequently causes decreased blood pressure lower extremities relative arms delayed absent femoral arterial pulses pheochromocytoma cause abrupt paroxysmal episodes hypertension accompanied headache palpitations pale appearance excessive sweating22
hypertensive crisisedit
main article hypertensive crisis
severely elevated blood pressure equal greater systolic diastolic referred hypertensive crisis hypertensive crisis categorized either hypertensive urgency hypertensive emergency according absence presence organ damage respectively2324
hypertensive urgency evidence organ damage resulting elevated blood pressure cases oral medications used lower gradually hours25
hypertensive emergency evidence direct damage organs2627 affected organs include brain kidney heart lungs producing symptoms include confusion drowsiness chest pain breathlessness25 hypertensive emergency blood pressure must reduced rapidly stop ongoing organ damage25 however lack randomized controlled trial evidence approach27
