historyedit
early theories causes planetary motion dynamics celestial spheres
modern analytic celestial mechanics started isaac newtons principia 1687 name celestial mechanics recent newton wrote field called rational mechanics term dynamics came little later gottfried leibniz century newton pierresimon laplace introduced term celestial mechanics prior kepler little connection exact quantitative prediction planetary positions using geometrical arithmetical techniques contemporary discussions physical causes planets motion
johannes kepleredit
detailed treatments laws planetary motion used keplers laws planetary motion keplerian problem
johannes kepler 1571–1630 first closely integrate predictive geometrical astronomy dominant ptolemy century copernicus physical concepts produce astronomy based upon causes celestial physics 1609 work modern laws planetary orbits developed using physical principles planetary observations made tycho brahe keplers model greatly improved accuracy predictions planetary motion years isaac newton developed gravitation 1686
isaac newtonedit
isaac newton december 1642–31 march 1727 credited introducing idea motion objects heavens planets moon motion objects ground like cannon balls falling apples could described physical laws sense unified celestial terrestrial dynamics using newtons universal gravitation proving keplers laws case circular orbit simple elliptical orbits involve complex calculations newton included principia

celestial motion without additional forces thrust rocket governed gravitational acceleration masses masses simplification nbody problem problem assumes number spherically symmetric masses case integration accelerations well approximated relatively simple summations

examples

4body problem spaceflight mars parts flight influence bodies small 3body problem also patched conic approximation
3body problem

quasisatellite
spaceflight stay lagrangian point





case twobody problem situation much simpler larger various explicit formulas apply general case typically numerical solutions possible useful simplification often approximately valid

examples

binary star alpha centauri approx mass
binary asteroid antiope approx mass



simplification based standard assumptions astrodynamics include body orbiting body much smaller central body also often approximately valid

examples

solar system orbiting center milky
planet orbiting
moon orbiting planet
spacecraft orbiting earth moon planet latter cases approximation applies arrival orbit



either instead previous simplification assume circular orbits making distance orbital speeds potential kinetic energies constant time assumption sacrifices accuracy simplicity especially high eccentricity orbits definition noncircular

examples

orbit dwarf planet pluto 02488
orbit mercury 02056
hohmann transfer orbit
gemini flight
suborbital flights



perturbation theoryedit
perturbation theory comprises mathematical methods used find approximate solution problem cannot solved exactly closely related methods used numerical analysis ancient earliest perturbation theory deal otherwise unsolveable mathematical problems celestial mechanics newtons solution orbit moon moves noticeably differently simple keplerian ellipse competing gravitation earth
perturbation methods start simplified form original problem carefully chosen exactly solvable celestial mechanics usually keplerian ellipse correct gravitating bodies earth moon circular orbit correct special cases twobody motion often close enough practical solved simplified problem perturbed make starting conditions closer real problem including gravitational attraction third body slight changes results simplified used corrections simplifications introduced along every step corrections never perfect even cycle corrections often provides remarkably better approximate solution real problem
requirement stop cycle corrections partially corrected solution reused starting point another cycle perturbations corrections common difficulty method usually corrections progressively make solutions much complicated cycle much difficult manage previous cycle corrections newton reported said regarding problem moons orbit causeth head ache1
general procedure starting simplified problem gradually adding corrections make starting point corrected problem closer real situation widely used mathematical tool advanced sciences engineering natural extension guess check method used anciently numbers
