multidisciplinary interdisciplinary monodisciplinary fieldedit
swedish researcher emin tengström 199310 described crossdisciplinary research process state structure differentiates three levels ambition regarding crossdisciplinary research

pluridisciplinary multidisciplinarity level
genuine crossdisciplinary level interdisciplinarity
disciplineforming level transdisciplinarity

described view social fields dynamic changing library information science viewed field started multidisciplinary field based literature psychology sociology management computer science developing towards academic discipline right however following quote seems indicate actually developing opposite direction
chua yang 200811 studied papers published journal american society information science technology period 19881997 found among things authors grown diversity affiliated predominantly libraryinformationrelated departments include information systems management information technology business humanities amid heterogeneous clusters collaboration among authors strongly connected crossdisciplinary coauthor pairs become prevalent correspondingly distribution keywords’ occurrences leans heavily core information science shifted towards subdisciplines information technology sociobehavioral science
field body interrelated concepts techniques journals professional associations clearly discipline nature subject matter methods clearly interdiscipline drawing many adjacent fields
fragmented adhocracyedit

scattering literatureedit
meho spurgin 200515 found list 2625 items published 1982 2002 faculty members schools library information science databases provided significant coverage literature results also show restricting data sources even three databases leads inaccurate rankings erroneous conclusions database provides comprehensive coverage literature researchers must rely wide range disciplinary multidisciplinary databases ranking research purposes even nine comprehensive databases searched combined 2635 publications remain found

study confirms earlier research literature highly scattered limited standard databases known verified however significant amount literature indexed interdisciplinary multidisciplinary databases inside conferences inspec interdisciplinary databases america history life also found useful complementary traditional databases particularly areas archives library history meho spurgin 2005 p1329
