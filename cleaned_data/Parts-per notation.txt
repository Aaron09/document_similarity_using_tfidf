overviewedit
partsper notation often used describing dilute solutions chemistry instance relative abundance dissolved minerals pollutants water unit ppm” used mass fraction waterborne pollutant present onemillionth gram gram sample solution working aqueous solutions common assume density water therefore common equate kilogram water water consequently corresponds corresponds
similarly partsper notation used also physics engineering express value various proportional phenomena instance special metal alloy might expand micrometers meter length every degree celsius would expressed ppm°c” partsper notation also employed denote change stability uncertainty measurements instance accuracy landsurvey distance measurements using laser rangefinder might millimeter kilometer distance could expressed “accuracy ppm”1
partsper notations dimensionless quantities mathematical expressions units measurement always cancel fractions like nanometers meter” nano 10−9 0000000001 quotients purenumber coefficients positive values less partsper notations including percent symbol used regular prose opposed mathematical expressions still purenumber dimensionless quantities however generally take literal “parts per” meaning comparative ratio ppb” would generally interpreted “two parts billion parts”2
partsper notations expressed terms unit measure instance coefficient thermal expansion certain brass alloy ppm°c expressed µmm°c µinin°c numeric value representing relative proportion change adoption different unit measure3 similarly metering pump injects trace chemical main process line proportional flow rate rate expressed variety volumetric units including µgalgal cm3m3
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopyedit
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy chemical shift usually expressed represents difference measured frequency parts million reference frequency reference frequency depends instruments magnetic field element measured usually expressed typical chemical shifts rarely hundred reference frequency chemical shifts conveniently expressed hzmhz partsper notation gives dimensionless quantity depend instruments field strength

although international bureau weights measures international standards organization known also frenchlanguage initials bipm recognizes partsper notation formally part international system units note although “percent” formally part bipm take position mathematical expressions internationally recognized symbol percent used represent number 001” dimensionless quantities25 according iupap continued source annoyance unit purists continued percent ppt”6 although sicompliant expressions used alternative partsper notation remains nevertheless widely used technical disciplines main problems partsper notation following
long short scalesedit
named numbers starting “billion” different values different countries bipm suggests avoiding “ppb” “ppt” prevent misunderstanding english language named numbers consistent meaning “million” starting “billion” numbering conventions “long” “short” scales “billion” mean either 1012 national institute standards technology nist takes stringent position stating “the languagedependent terms acceptable express values quantities”7
thousand trillionedit
although usually means parts trillion occasionally means parts thousand unless meaning defined explicitly guessed context
mass fraction mole fraction volume fractionedit
another problem partsper notation refer mass fraction mole fraction volume fraction since usually stated quantity used better write unit kgkg molmol m3m3 even though dimensionless8 difference quite significant dealing gases important specify quantity used example conversion factor mass fraction mole fraction greenhouse cfc11 volume fraction suffix sometimes appended partsper notation ppmv ppbv pptv910 unfortunately ppbv pptv also often used mole fractions identical volume fraction ideal gases
usage generally quite fixed inside specific branches science leading researchers draw conclusion usage massmass molmol volumevolume others correct turn leads specify usage publications others therefore misinterpret results example electrochemists often volumevolume chemical engineers massmass well volumevolume many academic papers otherwise excellent level fail specify usage partsper notation

improper applicationsedit
partsper notation properly used express true dimensionless quantities units measurement must cancel expressions like mgkg quotients pure numbers values less mixedunit quantities radon concentration pcil dimensionless quantities expressed using form partsper notation examples measures dimensionless quantities follows

particulate matter µgm3
stepper motorgear system produces motion µmpulse
mercury vapor concentration

note however uncommon express aqueous concentrations—particularly drinkingwater reports intended general public—using partsper notation reports state notations denote milligrams liter micrograms liter although dimensionless quantity assumed scientific circles mgkg true measure liter water mass kilogram goal technical writing including drinkingwater reports general public clearly communicate intended audience minimal confusion drinking water intuitively volumetric quantity public’s mind measures contamination expressed perliter basis considered easier grasp still technically possible example dissolve liter hydrophilic chemical liter water partsper notation would confusing describing solubility water greater million parts million would simply state volume mass dissolve liter instead
reporting airborne rather waterborne densities slightly different convention used since approximately 1000 times less dense water water µgm3 roughly equivalent partspertrillion whereas roughly equivalent partsperbillion note also case convention much less accurate whereas liter water almost exactly cubic meter often taken 1143 kg—much less accurate still close enough many practical usescitation needed
