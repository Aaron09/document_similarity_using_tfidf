mechanisms




pneumonia fills lungs alveoli fluid hindering oxygenation alveolus left normal whereas right full fluid pneumonia


pneumonia frequently starts upper respiratory tract infection moves lower respiratory tract40 pneumonitis lung inflammation combined consolidation liquid spaces normally inflated air41
viral
viruses reach lung number different routes respiratory syncytial virus typically contracted people touch contaminated objects touch eyes nose32 viral infections occur contaminated airborne droplets inhaled mouth nose21 upper airway viruses make lungs invade cells lining airways alveoli lung parenchyma32 viruses measles herpes simplex reach lungs blood42 invasion lungs lead varying degrees cell death32 immune system responds infection even lung damage occur32 primarily white blood cells mainly mononuclear cells generate inflammation42 well damaging lungs many viruses simultaneously affect organs thus disrupt body functions viruses also make body susceptible bacterial infections bacterial pneumonia arise comorbid condition33
bacterial
bacteria enter lungs small aspirations organisms residing throat nose21 half normal people small aspirations sleep25 throat always contains bacteria potentially infectious ones reside certain times certain conditions25 minority types bacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis legionella pneumophila reach lungs contaminated airborne droplets21 bacteria spread also blood22 lungs bacteria invade spaces cells alveoli macrophages neutrophils defensive white blood cells attempt inactivate bacteria43 neutrophils also release cytokines causing general activation immune system44 leads fever chills fatigue common bacterial pneumonia44 neutrophils bacteria fluid surrounding blood vessels fill alveoli resulting consolidation seen chest xray45

communityacquired pneumonia acquired community6162 outside health care facilities compared health care–associated pneumonia less likely involve multidrugresistant bacteria although latter longer rare cap61 still less likely
healthcare
health care–associated pneumonia hcap infection associated recent exposure health care system61 including hospital outpatient clinic nursing home dialysis center chemotherapy treatment home care62
hcap sometimes called mcap medical care–associated pneumonia
hospital
hospitalacquired pneumonia acquired hospital61 specifically pneumonia occurs hours admission incubating time admission62 likely involve hospitalacquired infections higher risk multidrugresistant pathogens also hospital patients often present hospital comorbidities issue
ventilator
ventilatorassociated pneumonia occurs people breathing help mechanical ventilation61 specifically pneumonia arises hours endotracheal intubation62 like medical device ventilators involve risk infection difficult prevent bacteria colonizing internal parts surfaces even diligent cleaning people need ventilators typically rather begin superimposed pneumonia always easily managed immunodeficiency involved poor nutritional status whichever disorders comorbid
differential diagnosis
several diseases present similar signs symptoms pneumonia chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd asthma pulmonary edema bronchiectasis lung cancer pulmonary emboli8 unlike pneumonia asthma copd typically present wheezing pulmonary edema presents abnormal electrocardiogram cancer bronchiectasis present cough longer duration pulmonary emboli presents acute onset sharp chest pain shortness breath8
prevention
prevention includes vaccination environmental measures appropriate treatment health problems20 believed appropriate preventive measures instituted globally mortality among children could reduced 400000 proper treatment universally available childhood deaths could decreased another 60000022
vaccination
vaccination prevents certain bacterial viral pneumonias children adults influenza vaccines modestly effective preventing symptoms influenza1163 center disease control prevention recommends yearly vaccination every person months older64 immunizing health care workers decreases risk viral pneumonia among patients57
vaccinations haemophilus influenzae streptococcus pneumoniae good evidence support use40 vaccinating children streptococcus pneumoniae decreased incidence infections adults many adults acquire infections children streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine available adults found decrease risk invasive pneumococcal disease65 vaccines support protective effect pneumonia include pertussis varicella measles66
medications
influenza outbreaks occur medications amantadine rimantadine help prevent condition however associated side effects67 zanamivir oseltamivir decrease chance exposed develop symptoms however recommended potential side effects taken account68

smoking cessation50 reducing indoor pollution cooking indoors wood dung recommended2022 smoking appears single biggest risk factor pneumococcal pneumonia otherwisehealthy adults57 hand hygiene coughing ones sleeve also effective preventative measures66 wearing surgical masks sick also prevent illness57
appropriately treating underlying illnesses hivaids diabetes mellitus malnutrition decrease risk pneumonia226669 children less months exclusive breast feeding reduces risk severity disease22 hivaids count less cellsul antibiotic trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole decreases risk pneumocystis pneumonia70 also useful prevention immunocomprised hiv71
