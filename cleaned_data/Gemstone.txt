traditional classification west goes back ancient greeks begins distinction precious semiprecious similar distinctions made cultures modern precious stones diamond ruby sapphire emerald gemstones semiprecious3 distinction reflects rarity respective stones ancient times well quality translucent fine color purest forms except colorless diamond hard hardnesses mohs scale stones classified color translucency hardness traditional distinction necessarily reflect modern values example garnets relatively inexpensive green garnet called tsavorite valuable midquality emerald4 another unscientific term semiprecious gemstones used history archaeology hardstone terms precious semiprecious commercial context arguably misleading deceptively implies certain stones intrinsically valuable others necessarily case
modern times gemstones identified gemologists describe gems characteristics using technical terminology specific field gemology first characteristic gemologist uses identify gemstone chemical composition example diamonds made carbon rubies aluminium oxide

next many gems crystals classified crystal system cubic trigonal monoclinic another term used habit form usually found example diamonds cubic crystal system often found octahedrons
gemstones classified different groups species varieties5 example ruby variety species corundum color corundum considered sapphire examples emerald green aquamarine blue beryl goshenite colorless heliodor yellow morganite pink varieties mineral species beryl
gems characterized terms refractive index dispersion specific gravity hardness cleavage fracture luster exhibit pleochroism double refraction luminescence distinctive absorption spectrum
material flaws within stone present inclusions
gemstones also classified terms water recognized grading gems luster transparency brilliance6 transparent gems considered first water second third water gems lesser transparency7

universally accepted grading system gemstones diamonds graded using system developed gemological institute america early 1950s historically gemstones graded using naked system included major innovation introduction magnification standard grading clarity gemstones still graded using naked assuming 2020 vision8
mnemonic device four color clarity carats introduced help consumer understand factors used grade diamond9 modification categories useful understanding grading gemstones four criteria carry different weight depending upon whether applied colored gemstones colorless diamonds diamonds primary determinant value followed clarity color diamonds meant sparkle break light constituent rainbow colors dispersion chop bright little pieces scintillation deliver brilliance rough crystalline form diamond none things requires proper fashioning called gemstones color including colored diamonds purity beauty color primary determinant quality
physical characteristics make colored stone valuable color clarity lesser extent emeralds always number inclusions unusual optical phenomena within stone color zoning uneven distribution coloring within asteria star effects greeks example greatly valued asteria gemstones regarded powerful love charms helen troy known worn starcorundum10
aside diamond ruby sapphire emerald pearl strictly speaking gemstone opal11 also considered precious discoveries bulk amethyst brazil 19th century amethyst considered precious stone well going back ancient greece even last century certain stones aquamarine peridot cats cymophane popular hence regarded precious
today distinction longer made gemstone trade12 many gemstones used even expensive jewelry depending brand name designer fashion trends market supply treatments nevertheless diamonds rubies sapphires emeralds still reputation exceeds gemstones13
rare unusual gemstones generally meant include gemstones occur infrequently quality scarcely known except connoisseurs include andalusite axinite cassiterite clinohumite beryl14

diamond cutter amsterdam netherlands 2012


gemstones used gems crystal form found however polished usage jewelry picture left rural commercial cutting operation thailand small factory cuts thousands carats sapphire annually main classifications stones smooth dome shaped stones called cabochons stones faceting machine polishing small flat windows called facets regular intervals exact angles
stones opaque semiopaque opal turquoise variscite commonly cabochons gems designed show stones color surface properties opal star sapphires grinding wheels polishing agents used grind shape polish smooth dome shape stones16
gems transparent normally faceted method shows optical properties stones interior best advantage maximizing reflected light perceived viewer sparkle many commonly used shapes faceted stones facets must proper angles varies depending optical properties angles steep shallow light pass reflected back toward viewer faceting machine used hold stone onto flat cutting polishing flat facets17 rarely cutters special curved laps polish curved facets
colorsedit




nearly variations diamond color exhibited aurora display natural history museum london


color material nature light daylight often called white light actually colors spectrum combined light strikes material light absorbed smaller amount particular frequency wavelength reflected part reflected reaches perceived color ruby appears absorbs colors white light green blue reflecting
material mostly exhibit different colors example ruby sapphire primary chemical composition corundum exhibit different colors impurities even named gemstone occur many different colors sapphires show different shades blue pink fancy sapphires exhibit whole range colors yellow orangepink latter called padparadscha sapphirecitation needed
difference color based atomic structure stone although different stones formally chemical composition structure exactly every atom replaced completely different atom sometimes million atoms socalled impurities sufficient absorb certain colors leave colors unaffected
example beryl colorless pure mineral form becomes emerald chromium impurities manganese added instead chromium beryl becomes pink morganite iron becomes aquamarine
gemstone treatments make fact impurities manipulated thus changing color gem5
treatmentedit
gemstones often treated enhance color clarity stone depending type extent treatment affect value stone treatments used widely resulting stable others accepted commonly color unstable revert original tone18
heatedit
heat improve gemstone color clarity heating process well known miners cutters centuries many stone types heating common practice citrine made heating amethyst partial heating strong gradient results “ametrine” stone partly amethyst partly citrine aquamarine often heated remove yellow tones change green colors desirable blue enhance existing blue color purer blue19
nearly tanzanite heated temperatures remove brown undertones give desirable blue purple color20 considerable portion sapphire ruby treated variety heat treatments improve color clarity
jewelry containing diamonds heated repairs diamond protected boric acid otherwise diamond pure carbon could burned surface even burned completely jewelry containing sapphires rubies heated stones coated boracic acid etch surface substance protected burning like diamond although stones need protected heat stress fracture immersing part jewelry stones water metal parts heated

waxingoilingedit
emeralds containing natural fissures sometimes filled disguise also colored make emerald appear better color well clarity turquoise also commonly treated similar manner
fracture fillingedit
fracture filling different gemstones diamonds emeralds sapphires 2006 glass filled rubies received publicity rubies carats large fractures filled lead glass thus dramatically improving appearance larger rubies particular treatments fairly easy detect
synthetic artificial gemstonesedit
important distinguish synthetic gemstones imitation simulated gems
synthetic gems physically optically chemically identical natural stone created controlled conditions laboratory21 imitation simulated stones chemically different natural stone optically similar glass plastic resins compounds
examples simulated imitation stones include cubic zirconia composed zirconium oxide simulated moissanite diamond simulants imitations copy look color real stone possess neither chemical physical characteristics moissanite actually higher refractive index diamond presented beside equivalently sized diamond fire diamond
synthetic cultured labcreated gemstones imitations example diamonds rubies sapphires emeralds manufactured labs possess identical chemical physical characteristics naturally occurring variety synthetic created corundum including ruby sapphire common costs much less natural stones smaller synthetic diamonds manufactured large quantities industrial abrasives although larger gemquality synthetic diamonds becoming available multiple carats22
