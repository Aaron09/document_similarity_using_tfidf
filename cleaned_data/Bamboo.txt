flowering bamboo






phyllostachys glauca yunzhu flower


bamboos seldom unpredictably flower frequency flowering varies greatly species species flowering takes place plant declines often dies entirely fact many species flower intervals long years taxa exhibit mass flowering gregarious flowering plants particular cohort flowering severalyear period plant derived clonal propagation cohort also flower regardless whether planted different location longest mass flowering interval known years species phyllostachys bambusoides sieb zucc species plants stock flower time regardless differences geographic locations climatic conditions bamboo dies lack environmental impact time flowering indicates presence sort alarm clock cell plant signals diversion energy flower production cessation vegetative growth19 mechanism well evolutionary cause behind still largely mystery
hypothesis explain evolution semelparous mass flowering predator satiation hypothesis argues fruiting time population increases survival rate seeds flooding area fruit even predators fill seeds still left flowering cycle longer lifespan rodent predators bamboos regulate animal populations causing starvation period flowering events thus death adult clone resource exhaustion would effective parent plants devote resources creating large seed crop hold back energy regeneration20
another fire cycle hypothesis states periodic flowering followed death adult plants evolved mechanism create disturbance habitat thus providing seedlings grow argues dead culms create large fuel load also large target lightning strikes increasing likelihood wildfire21 bamboos aggressive early successional plants seedlings would able outstrip plants take space left parents
however disputed different reasons predator satiation hypothesis explain flowering cycle times longer lifespan local rodents something predicted bamboo fire cycle hypothesis considered scientists unreasonable argue22 fires result humans natural fire india notion considered wrong based distribution lightning strike data season throughout india however another argument lack precedent living organism harness something unpredictable lightning strikes increase chance survival part natural evolutionary progress23
recently mathematical explanation extreme length flowering cycles offered involving stabilizing selection implied predator satiation hypothesis others fact plants flower longer intervals tend release seeds2425 hypothesis claims bamboo flowering intervals grew integer multiplication mutant bamboo plant flowering noninteger multiple populations flowering interval would release seeds alone would enjoy benefits collective flowering protection predators however mutant bamboo plant flowering integer multiple populations flowering interval would release seeds collective flowering events would release seeds average plant population could therefore take population establishing flowering interval integer multiple previous flowering interval hypothesis predicts observed bamboo flowering intervals factorize small prime numbers
mass fruiting also direct economic ecological consequences however huge increase available fruit forests often causes boom rodent populations leading increases disease famine nearby human populations example devastating consequences occur melocanna bambusoides population flowers fruits every 30–35 years26 around bengal death bamboo plants following fruiting means local people lose building material large increase bamboo fruit leads rapid increase rodent populations number rodents increases consume available food including grain fields stored food sometimes leading famine rats also carry dangerous diseases typhus typhoid bubonic plague reach epidemic proportions rodents increase number1920 relationship populations bamboo flowering examined 2009 nova documentary attack

bamboo used construction purposes must harvested culms reach greatest strength sugar levels lowest high sugar content increases ease rate pest infestation
harvesting bamboo typically undertaken according cycles
lifecycle culm individual culm goes 7year lifecycle culms ideally allowed reach level maturity prior full capacity harvesting clearing thinning culms particularly older decaying culms helps ensure adequate light resources growth wellmaintained clumps productivity three four times unharvested wild clump consistent lifecycle described bamboo harvested three years five seven years depending species
annual cycle growth bamboo occurs season disturbing clump phase potentially damage upcoming crop also highrainfall period levels highest diminish towards season picking immediately prior wetgrowth season also damage shoots hence harvesting best months prior start season
daily cycle height photosynthesis peak producing highest levels sugar making least ideal time harvest many traditional practitioners believe best time harvest dawn dusk waning moon
leachingedit
leaching removal harvest many areas world levels harvested bamboo reduced either leaching postharvest photosynthesis examples practice include

bamboo raised clear ground leaned rest clump weeks leaves turn yellow allow full consumption sugars plant
similar method undertaken base culm standing fresh water either large drum stream leach
culms immersed running stream weighted three four weeks
water pumped freshly culms forcing method often used conjunction injection form treatment

process water leaching bamboo dried slowly evenly shade avoid cracking outer skin bamboo thereby reducing opportunities pest infestation
