general rule procedure considered surgical involves cutting patients tissues closure previously sustained wound procedures necessarily fall rubric angioplasty endoscopy considered surgery involve common surgical procedure settings sterile environment anesthesia antiseptic conditions typical surgical instruments suturing stapling forms surgery considered invasive procedures socalled noninvasive surgery usually refers excision penetrate structure excised laser ablation cornea radiosurgical procedure irradiation tumor
types surgeryedit
surgical procedures commonly categorized urgency type procedure body system involved degree invasiveness special instrumentation

based purpose exploratory surgery performed confirm diagnosis therapeutic surgery treats previously diagnosed condition cosmetic surgery done subjectively improve appearance otherwise normal structure
type procedure amputation involves cutting body part usually limb digit castration also example resection removal internal organ body part part lung lobe liver quadrant organ body part name code designation replantation involves reattaching severed body part reconstructive surgery involves reconstruction injured mutilated deformed part body excision cutting removal part organ tissue body part patient transplant surgery replacement organ body part insertion another different human animal patient removing organ body part live human animal transplant also type surgery
body part surgery performed organ system structure classed organ organ system tissue involved examples include cardiac surgery performed heart gastrointestinal surgery performed within digestive tract accessory organs orthopedic surgery performed bones muscles
degree invasiveness surgical procedures minimallyinvasive surgery involves smaller outer incisions insert miniaturized instruments within body cavity structure laparoscopic surgery angioplasty contrast open surgical procedure laparotomy requires large incision access area interest
equipment used laser surgery involves laser cutting tissue instead scalpel similar surgical instruments microsurgery involves operating microscope surgeon small structures robotic surgery makes surgical robot vinci zeus surgical systems control instrumentation direction surgeon

main article preoperative care
prior surgery patient given medical examination receives certain preoperative tests physical status rated according physical status classification system results satisfactory patient signs consent form given surgical clearance procedure expected result significant blood loss autologous blood donation made weeks prior surgery surgery involves digestive system patient instructed perform bowel prep drinking solution polyethylene glycol night procedure patients also instructed abstain food drink order midnight night procedure minimize effect stomach contents preoperative medications reduce risk aspiration patient vomits procedure
medical systems practice routinely performing chest xrays surgery premise behind practice physician might discover unknown medical condition would complicate surgery upon discovering chest xray physician would adapt surgery practice accordingly2 fact medical specialty professional organizations recommend routine preoperative chest xrays patients unremarkable medical history presented physical exam indicate chest xray2 routine xray examination likely result problems like misdiagnosis overtreatment negative outcomes result benefit patient2 likewise tests including complete blood count prothrombin time partial thromboplastin time basic metabolic panel urinalysis done unless results tests help evaluate surgical risk3

middleincome countriesedit
2014 lancet commission global surgery launched examine case surgery integral component global health care provide recommendations regarding delivery surgical anesthesia services middle income countries16 amongst conclusions study primary conclusions reached

five billion people worldwide lack access safe timely affordable surgical anesthesia care areas especially large proportions population lack access include subsaharan africa indian subcontinent central asia lesser extent russia china estimated 3129 million surgical procedures undertaken worldwide 2012 done countries comprising poorest worlds population
additional million surgical procedures needed year prevent unnecessary death disability

globally studies comparing outcomes surgery across different income level countries although evidence suggests significantly poorer outcomes surgery performed lower income settings major prospective study 10745 adult patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery centres high middle lowincome countries found mortality three times higher compared highhdi countries even adjusted prognostic factors17 study overall global mortality rate cent hours high cent middle cent cent 0·001 increasing cent days high cent middle cent cent 0·001 patients died 69·9 cent days following surgery high 74·2 cent middle 68·8 cent 60·5 cent patient safety factors suggested play important role surgical safety checklist associated reduced mortality days
