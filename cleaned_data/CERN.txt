founding member states cern 19541 borders 1954–1990


convention establishing cern ratified september 1954 countries western europe1 acronym cern originally represented french words conseil européen pour recherche nucléaire european council nuclear research provisional council building laboratory established european governments 1952 acronym retained laboratory provisional council dissolved even though name changed current organisation européenne pour recherche nucléaire european organization nuclear research 19547 according kowarski former director cern name changed abbreviation could become awkward oern heisenberg said could still cern even name notcitation needed
cerns first president benjamin lockspeiser edoardo amaldi general secretary cern early stages operations still provisional first directorgeneral 1954 felix bloch8
laboratory originally devoted study atomic nuclei soon applied higherenergy physics concerned mainly study interactions subatomic particles therefore laboratory operated cern commonly referred european laboratory particle physics laboratoire européen pour physique particules better describes research performed
scientific achievements
several important achievements particle physics made experiments cern include

1973 discovery neutral currents gargamelle bubble chamber9
1983 discovery bosons experiments10
1989 determination number light neutrino families large electron–positron collider operating boson peak
1995 first creation antihydrogen atoms ps210 experiment11
1999 discovery direct violation na48 experiment12
2010 isolation atoms antihydrogen13
2011 maintaining antihydrogen minutes14
2012 boson mass around gevc2 consistent longsought higgs boson15

september 2011 cern attracted media attention opera collaboration reported detection possibly fasterthanlight neutrinos16 tests showed results flawed incorrectly connected synchronization cable17
1984 nobel prize physics awarded carlo rubbia simon meer developments resulted discoveries bosons 1992 nobel prize physics awarded cern staff researcher georges charpak invention development particle detectors particular multiwire proportional chamber 2013 nobel prize physics awarded françois englert peter higgs theoretical description higgs mechanism year higgs boson found cern experiments
