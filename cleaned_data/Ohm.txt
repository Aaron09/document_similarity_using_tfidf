historyedit
rapid rise electrotechnology last half 19th century created demand rational coherent consistent international system units electrical quantities telegraphers early users electricity 19th century needed practical standard unit measurement resistance resistance often expressed multiple resistance standard length telegraph wires different agencies used different bases standard units readily interchangeable electrical units defined coherent system units energy mass length time requiring conversion factors used calculations relating energy power resistance3
different methods establishing system electrical units chosen various artifacts length wire standard electrochemical cell could specified producing defined quantities resistance voltage alternatively electrical units related mechanical units defining example unit current gives specified force wires unit charge gives unit force unit charges latter method ensures coherence units energy defining unit resistance coherent units energy time effect also requires defining units potential current desirable unit electrical potential force unit electric current unit electrical resistance unit work unit time otherwise electrical calculations require conversion factors
since socalled absolute units charge current expressed combinations units mass length time dimensional analysis relations potential current resistance show resistance expressed units length time velocity early definitions unit resistance example defined unit resistance quadrant earth second
absoluteunits system related magnetic electrostatic quantities metric base units mass time length units great advantage simplifying equations used solution electromagnetic problems eliminated conversion factors calculations electrical quantities however centimetergramsecond units turned impractical sizes practical measurements

intended units owing error calculations definition small error significant preparation working standards

19th century units well understood consistent definitions would change little effect commercial uses units advances metrology allowed definitions formulated high degree precision repeatability
