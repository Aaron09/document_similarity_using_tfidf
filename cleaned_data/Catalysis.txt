inhibitors poisons promotersedit
substances reduce action catalysts called catalyst inhibitors reversible catalyst poisons irreversible promoters substances increase catalytic activity even though catalysts
inhibitors sometimes referred negative catalysts since decrease reaction rate28 however term inhibitor preferred since work introducing reaction path higher activation energy would reduce rate since reaction would continue occur noncatalyzed path instead either deactivating catalysts removing reaction intermediates free radicals2829
inhibitor modify selectivity addition rate instance reduction alkynes alkenes palladium catalyst partly poisoned leadii acetate pbch3co22 used30 without deactivation catalyst alkene produced would reduced alkane3132
inhibitor produce effect selectively poisoning certain types active sites another mechanism modification surface geometry instance hydrogenation operations large planes metal surface function sites hydrogenolysis catalysis sites catalyzing hydrogenation unsaturates smaller thus poison covers surface randomly tend reduce number uncontaminated large planes leave proportionally smaller sites free thus changing hydrogenation hydrogenolysis selectivity many mechanisms also possible
