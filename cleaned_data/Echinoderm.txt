regenerationedit




sunflower star regenerating several arms


many echinoderms remarkable powers regeneration many species routinely autotomize regenerate arms viscera cucumbers often discharge parts internal organs perceive threatened discharged organs tissues regenerated course several months urchins constantly replacing spines lost damage stars lilies readily lose regenerate arms cases single severed cannot grow starfish absence least part disc38394041 however species single survive develop complete individual394041 species arms intentionally detached purpose asexual reproduction periods lost digestive tracts cucumbers live stored nutrients absorb dissolved organic matter directly water42
regeneration lost parts involves epimorphosis morphallaxis epimorphosis stem cells—either reserve pool produced dedifferentiation—form blastema generate tissues morphallactic regeneration involves movement remodelling existing tissues replace lost parts direct transdifferentiation type tissue another tissue replacement also observed43
robust larval growth responsible many echinoderms used popular model organisms developmental biology44
reproductionedit
sexual reproductionedit
echinoderms become sexually mature approximately three years depending species environmental conditions nearly gonochoric though species hermaphroditic eggs sperm cells typically released open water fertilization takes place release sperm eggs synchronised species usually regard lunar cycle species individuals aggregate reproductive season thereby increasing likelihood successful fertilisation internal fertilisation currently observed three species star three brittle stars deep water cucumber even abyssal depths light penetrates synchronisation reproductive activity echinoderms surprisingly frequent45
echinoderms brood eggs especially common cold water species planktonic larvae might able find sufficient food retained eggs usually number supplied large yolks nourish developing embryos starfish female carry eggs special pouches arms arched body even cardiac stomach46 many brittle stars hermaphrodites brooding quite common usually takes place special chambers oral surfaces sometimes ovary coelom used47 starfish brittle stars direct development without passing bilateral larval stage usually takes place48 urchins species sand dollar carry eggs cavities near anus holding place spines49 cucumbers buccal tentacles transfer eggs underside back retained small number species eggs retained coelom develop viviparously later emerging ruptures body wall50 species crinoid embryos develop special breeding bags eggs held sperm released male happens find them51
asexual reproductionedit
species seastar ophidiaster granifer reproduces asexually parthenogenesis52 certain asterozoans adults reproduce asexually mature time reproduce sexually species asexual reproduction transverse fission disc splitting regrowth lost disc area missing arms occur4153 individual arms varying lengths though species least part disc needed complete regeneration species stars single severed grow complete individual period several months394041 least species actively method asexual reproduction3954 fracture develops lower surface pulls free body holds onto substrate process54 period regrowth tiny arms large thus often referred comets4054
asexual reproduction transverse fission also observed adult cucumbers holothuria parvula uses method frequently individual splitting little front midpoint halves regenerate missing organs period several months missing genital organs often slow develop55
larvae echinoderm species capable asexual reproduction long known occur among starfish brittle stars recently observed cucumber sand dollar urchin species belong four major classes echinoderms except crinozoans 201156 asexual reproduction planktonic larvae occurs numerous modes autotomise parts develop secondary larvae grow buds undergo paratomy parts autotomised buds develop directly fully formed larvae develop gastrula even blastula stage parts develop larvae vary preoral hood mound like structure mouth side body wall posterolateral arms rear ends565758

echinopluteus larva larval arms


development echinoderm begins bilaterally symmetrical embryo coeloblastula developing first gastrulation marks opening second mouth places echinoderms within deuterostomes mesoderm host skeleton migrates inwards secondary body cavity coelom forms partitioning three body cavities larvae mostly planktonic species eggs retained inside female larvae also brooded female62
larvae echinoderms pass number stages specific names derived taxonomic names adults appearance example urchin echinopluteus larva brittle star ophiopluteus larva starfish bipinnaria larva later develops multiarmed brachiolaria larva cucumber larva auricularia crinoid vitellaria larvae bilaterally symmetrical bands cilia swim usually known pluteus larvae arms fully developed settle seabed undergo metamorphosis larval arms degenerate left hand side larva develops oral surface juvenile right side becomes aboral surface stage bilateral symmetry lost radial symmetry develops6263
planktotrophic larva considered ancestral larval type echinoderms million years larval evolution species whose development known lecithotrophic larval type9 provision yolksac means smaller numbers eggs produced larvae shorter development period smaller dispersal potential greater chance survival seems evolutionary trend towards lowerrisk–lowergain strategy direct development9
distribution habitatedit
echinoderms globally distributed almost depths latitudes environments ocean reach highest diversity reef environments also widespread shallow shores around poles refugia crinoids abundant throughout deep ocean bottomdwelling burrowing cucumbers common sometimes accounting organisms almost echinoderms benthic live floor sealilies swim great velocity brief periods time deepsea cucumbers fully floating crinoids pseudoplanktonic attaching floating logs debris although behaviour exercised extensively paleozoic competition organisms barnacles restricted extent behaviour64
larvae echinoderms especially starfish urchins pelagic ocean currents transported great distances reinforcing global distribution phylum65
mode lifeedit
locomotionedit
echinoderms primarily tube feet move urchins also spines tube feet typically shaped like suction vacuum created contraction muscles along stickiness provided secretion mucus provides adhesion waves tube feet contractions relaxations move along adherent surface animal moves slowly along66
brittle stars agile echinoderms raising discs taking strides moving forward arms grip substrate tube feet side arms hindermost trails animal moves jerks spines provide traction moving among objects supple arms coil around things species creep around pointed tube feet66 starfish extend tube feet intended direction travel grip substrate suction feet drawn backwards movement multiple tube feet coordinated waves moves animal forward progress slow67 burrowing starfish points rather suckers tube feet able glide across seabed faster rate68
urchins tube feet move around similar starfish also articulated spines push lever along lift oral surfaces substrate urchin overturned extend tube feet ambulacral area enough bring within reach substrate successively attach feet adjoining area righted species bore rock usually grinding away surface mouthparts69
cucumbers generally sluggish animals many move surface burrow sand using peristaltic movements short tube feet surface creep along manner starfish species drag along means buccal tentacles others expand contract body rhythmically flex swim many live cracks hollows burrows hardly move deep water species pelagic float water webbed papillae forming sails fins70
majority crinoids motile lilies sessile attached hard substrates stalks stems bend arms roll unroll limit lilys movement although species relocate seabed crawling feathers unattached usually live crevices corals inside sponges arms visible part feathers emerge night perch nearby eminences better exploit foodbearing current many species walk across seabed raising body help arms many also swim arms largely sedentary seldom moving chosen place concealment71
feedingedit
modes feeding vary greatly different echinoderm taxa crinoids brittle stars tend passive filterfeeders enmeshing suspended particles passing water urchins grazers cucumbers deposit feeders majority starfish active hunters
crinoids suspension feeders spread arms wide catch particles floating past caught tube feet pinnules moved ambulacral grooves wrapped mucus conveyed mouth cilia lining grooves72 exact dietary requirements crinoids little researched laboratory diatoms73
basket stars suspension feeders raising branched arms collect zooplankton brittle stars several methods feeding though usually predominates suspension feeders securing food particles mucus strands spines tube feet raised arms others scavengers feeders detritus others voracious carnivores able lasso waterborne prey sudden encirclement flexible arms limbs bend disc transfer food jaws mouth74
many urchins feed algae often scraping thin layer algae covering surfaces rocks specialised mouthparts known aristotles lantern species devour smaller organisms catch tube feet also feed dead fish animal matter75 sand dollars perform suspension feeding feed phytoplankton detritus algal pieces bacterial layer surrounding grains sand76
many cucumbers mobile deposit suspension feeders using buccal podia actively capture food stuffing particles individually buccal cavities others ingest large quantities sediment absorb organic matter pass indigestible mineral particles guts disturb process large volumes substrate often leaving characteristic ridges sediment seabed cucumbers live infaunally burrows anteriorend anus surface swallowing sediment passing burrowers live anteriorend wait detritus fall entrances burrows rake debris surface nearby buccal podia77
nearly starfish detritivores carnivores though suspension feeders small fish landing upper surface captured pedicilaria dead animal matter scavenged main prey items living invertebrates mostly bivalve molluscs feed starfish moves attaches tube feet exerts pressure valves arching back small valves formed starfish inserts part stomach prey excretes digestive enzymes slowly liquefies soft body parts adductor muscle shellfish relaxes stomach inserted digestion complete stomach returned usual position starfish liquefied bivalve meal inside everted stomach process used starfish feed sponges anemones corals detritus algal films78
defense mechanismsedit
despite nutrition value abundance indigestible calcite echinoderms prey many organisms crabs sharks birds echinoderms defensive strategies employed include presence spines toxins inherent delivered tube feet discharge sticky entangling threads cucumbers although echinoderm spines blunt crownofthorns starfish long sharp cause painful puncture wound epithelium covering contains toxin6 catch connective tissue change rapidly flaccid rigid state echinoderms difficult dislodge crevices certain cucumbers cluster cuvierian tubules ejected long sticky threads anus entangle permanently disable attacker another defensive strategy sometimes adopted cucumbers rupture body wall discharge internal organs animal great regenerative capacity regrow lost parts later79 starfish brittle stars undergo autotomy attacked becoming detached distract predator long enough animal escape starfish species swim away danger foregoing regrowth losing limbs80 unusual find starfish arms different sizes various stages regrowth81
ecologyedit
echinoderms numerous relatively large invertebrates play important role marine benthic ecosystems9 grazing urchins reduces rate colonization bare rock settling organisms also keeps algae check thereby enhancing biodiversity coral reefs burrowing sand dollars cucumbers starfish stirs sediment depletes floor nutrients digging activities increases depth oxygen seep allows complex ecological tiersystem develop starfish brittle stars prevent growth algal mats coral reefs might otherwise obstruct filterfeeding constituent organisms82 urchins bore solid rock bioerosion destabilise rock faces release nutrients ocean coral reefs also bored rate accretion carbonate material often greater erosion produced urchin83 estimated echinoderms capture sequester gigatonnes carbon year calcium carbonate making important contributors global carbon cycle84
echinoderms sometimes large population swings cause marked consequences ecosystems example change coraldominated reef system algadominated resulted mass mortality tropical urchin diadema antillarum caribbean 198385 urchins among main herbivores reefs usually fine balance urchins kelp algae graze diminution numbers predators otters lobsters fish result increase urchin numbers causing overgrazing kelp forests result algadenuded urchin barren forms86 great barrier reef unexplained increase numbers crownofthorns starfish acanthaster planci graze living coral tissue considerable impact coral mortality coral reef biodiversity87
