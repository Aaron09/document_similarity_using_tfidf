mark slobin twentieth century ethnomusicologist observes discussion ethics founded several assumptions namely “ethics largely issue ‘western’ scholars working ‘nonwestern’ societies” “most ethical concerns arise interpersonal relations scholar ‘informant’ consequence fieldwork” “ethics situated within…the declared purpose researcher increase knowledge ultimate service human welfare” reference ralph beals “discussion ethical issues proceeds values western culture” slobin remarks accurate statement might acknowledge ethics vary across nations cultures ethics cultures researcher informant play fieldwork settings137
case scenarios ethically ambiguous situations slobin discusses include following137

discovery rare musical instrument leads debate whether preserved museum left native culture played necessarily preserved
filming documentary video brings issues consent filmed additionally film necessarily shown producer present answer questions clarify video’s content questions audience
deciding monetary gains musical production distributed prominent case ethical concern
attaining partial permission field usually enough justify filming recording every person group consent presence recording device
whether truthful possibly condemning information group situation treated extreme caution information could cause trouble musicians need censored

slobin’s discussion ethical issues ethnomusicology surprising highlights ethnomusicology community’s apathy towards public discussion ethical issues evidenced lackluster response scholars large 1970 meeting
slobin also points interesting facet ethical thinking among ethnomusicologists many ethical rules deal westerners studying nonwestern third world countries nonwestern ethnomusicologists immediately excluded rules westerner’s studying western music
also highlights several prevalent issues ethnomusicology using hypothetical cases american anthropological association newsletter framing terms ethnomusicology example “you bring local musician informants west tour wants perform pieces feel inappropriately represent tradition westerns genre reinforces western stereotypes musician’s homeland… right overrule insider territory”
ethnomusicologists also tend towards discussion ethics sociological contexts timothy taylor writes byproducts cultural appropriation music arguing 20th century commodification nonwestern musics serves marginalize certain groups musicians traditionally integrated western music production distribution industries138 steven feld argues ethnomusicologists also place analyzing ethics popular music collaboration paul simons work traditional zydeco chicano south african beats graceland feld notes inherently imbalanced power dynamics within musical collaboration contribute cultural exploitation45

women contributed extensively ethnomusicological fieldwork 1950s onward women’s gender studies ethnomusicology took 1970s146 ellen koskoff articulates three stages women’s studies within ethnomusicology first corrective approach filled basic gaps knowledge women’s contributions music culture second discussion relationships women expressed music third integrating study sexuality performance studies semiotics diverse forms meaningmaking146 since 1990s ethnomusicologists begun consider role fieldworker’s identity including gender sexuality interpret music cultures example susan mcclary’s watershed book feminine endings 1991 shows “relationships musical structure sociocultural values” influenced ethnomusicologists although ethnomusicological book147 general understanding western conceptions gender sexuality social constructions necessarily apply cultures predominantly western lens cause various methodological issues researchers148
