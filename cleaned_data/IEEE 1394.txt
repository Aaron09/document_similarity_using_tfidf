ieee 1394 interface standard serial highspeed communications isochronous realtime data transfer developed late 1980s early 1990s apple called firewire 1394 interface also known brands ilink sony lynx texas instruments
copper cable uses common implementation metres long power also carried cable allowing devices moderate power requirements operate without separate power supply firewire also available optical fiber versions

firewire apples name ieee 1394 high speed serial initiated apple 19863 developed ieee p1394 working group largely driven contributions apple although major contributions also made engineers texas instruments sony digital equipment corporation inmossgs thomson stmicroelectronics
ieee 1394 serial architecture highspeed data transfer firewire serial meaning information transferred time parallel buses utilize number different physical connections usually costly typically heavier4 ieee 1394 fully supports isochronous asynchronous applications
apple intended firewire serial replacement parallel scsi providing connectivity digital audio video equipment apples development began late 1980s later presented ieee5 completed january 1995 2007 ieee 1394 composite four documents original ieee 13941995 ieee 1394a2000 amendment ieee 1394b2002 amendment ieee 1394c2006 amendment june 2008 amendments well errata technical updates incorporated superseding standard ieee 139420086
apple first included onboard firewire 1999 macintosh models though buildtoorder option models since 1997 apple macintosh computers manufactured years 2000 2011 included firewire ports however february 2011 apple introduced first commercially available computer thunderbolt apple released last computers featuring firewire late 2012 2014 thunderbolt become standard feature across apples entire line computers effectively becoming spiritual successor firewire apple ecosystem
sonys implementation system ilink used smaller connector four signal conductors omitting conductors provide power devices favor separate power connector style later added 1394a amendment5 port sometimes labeled s100 s400 indicate speed mbits
system commonly used connect data storage devices digital video cameras also popular industrial systems machine vision professional audio systems many users preferred common greater effective speed power distribution capabilities benchmarks show sustained data transfer rates higher firewire lower results marked apple varied microsoft windows78
