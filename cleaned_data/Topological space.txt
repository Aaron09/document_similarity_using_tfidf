historyedit
around 1735 euler discovered formula

relating number vertices edges faces convex polyhedron hence planar graph study generalization formula specifically cauchy lhuilier origin topology riemann’s work early 1850s surfaces always dealt local point view parametric surfaces topological issues never considered2 möbius jordan seem first realize main problem topology compact surfaces find invariants preferably numerical decide equivalence surfaces decide whether surfaces homeomorphic not3
subject clearly defined felix klein erlangen program 1872 geometry invariants arbitrary continuous transformation kind geometry term topology introduced johann benedict listing 1847 although used term correspondence years earlier instead previously used analysis situs foundation science space dimension created poincaré first article topic appeared 18944 1930s james waddell alexander hassler whitney first expressed idea surface topological space locally like euclidean plane
definitionedit
main article characterizations category topological spaces
utility notion topology shown fact several equivalent definitions structure thus chooses axiomatisation suited application commonly used terms open sets perhaps intuitive terms neighbourhoods given first
definition neighbourhoodsedit
axiomatization felix hausdorff elements usually called points though mathematical object allow empty function assigning point nonempty collection subsets elements called neighbourhoods respect simply neighbourhoods function called neighbourhood topology axioms below5 satisfied called topological space

neighbourhood words point belongs every neighbourhoods
subset includes neighbourhood neighbourhood every superset neighbourhood point neighbourhood
intersection neighbourhoods neighbourhood
neighbourhood includes neighbourhood neighbourhood point

first three axioms neighbourhoods clear meaning fourth axiom important structure theory linking together neighbourhoods different points
standard example system neighbourhoods real line subset defined neighbourhood real number includes open interval containing
given structure subset defined open neighbourhood points open sets satisfy axioms given conversely given open sets topological space neighbourhoods satisfying axioms recovered defining neighbourhood includes open
definition open setsedit


four examples nonexamples topologies threepoint bottomleft example topology union missing bottomright example topology intersection missing


topological space ordered pair collection subsets satisfying following axioms7

empty belong
finite infinite union members still belongs
intersection finite number members still belongs

elements called open sets collection called topology
examplesedit

given collection subsets required axioms forms topology trivial topology indiscrete topology
given collection subsets forms another topology
given collection power topological space called discrete topology
given integers collection finite subsets integers plus topology example union finite sets containing zero infinite

definition closed setsedit
using morgans laws axioms defining open sets become axioms defining closed sets

empty closed
intersection collection closed sets also closed
union finite number closed sets also closed

using axioms another define topological space together collection closed subsets thus sets topology closed sets complements open sets
definitionsedit
many equivalent ways define topological space words concepts neighbourhood open closed sets reconstructed starting points satisfy correct axioms
another define topological space using kuratowski closure axioms define closed sets fixed points operator power
generalisation concept sequence topology completely determined every accumulation points specified
comparison topologiesedit
main article comparison topologies
variety topologies placed form topological space every topology also topology subset finer coarser proof relies existence certain open sets also hold finer topology similarly proof relies certain sets open applies coarser topology terms larger smaller sometimes used place finer coarser respectively terms stronger weaker also used literature little agreement meaning always sure authors convention reading
collection topologies given fixed forms complete lattice collection topologies meet intersection join meet collection topologies contain every member
continuous functionsedit
function topological spaces called continuous every every neighbourhood neighbourhood relates easily usual definition analysis equivalently continuous inverse image every open open8 attempt capture intuition jumps separations function homeomorphism bijection continuous whose inverse also continuous spaces called homeomorphic exists homeomorphism standpoint topology homeomorphic spaces essentially identical
category theory category topological spaces topological spaces objects continuous functions morphisms fundamental categories category theory attempt classify objects category homeomorphism invariants motivated areas research homotopy theory homology theory ktheory
examples topological spacesedit
given many different topologies given different topology viewed different topological space given discrete topology every subset open convergent sequences nets topology eventually constant also given trivial topology also called indiscrete topology empty whole space open every sequence topology converges every point space example shows general topological spaces limits sequences need unique however often topological spaces must hausdorff spaces limit points unique
metric spacesedit
main article metric space
metric spaces embody metric precise notion distance points
every metric space given metric topology basic open sets open balls defined metric standard topology normed vector space finitedimensional vector space topology norms
many ways defining topology real numbers standard topology generated open intervals open intervals forms base basis topology meaning every open union collection sets base particular means open exists open interval zero radius every point generally euclidean spaces given topology usual topology basic open sets open balls similarly complex numbers standard topology basic open sets open balls
