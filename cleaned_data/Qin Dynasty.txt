religionedit


floating high every direction
music fills hall court
incense sticks forest feathers
cloudy scene obscure darkness
metal stalks elegant blossoms
host flags kingfisher banners
music seven origins blossoming origins
intoned harmonious sounds
thus almost hear
spirits coming feast frolic
spirits seen musics
purifies refines human feelings
suddenly spirits ride darkness
brilliant event finishes
purified thoughts grow hidden still
warp weft world fall dark
