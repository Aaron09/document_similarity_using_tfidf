crude separated fractions fractional distillation fractions fractionating column lower boiling points fractions bottom heavy bottom fractions often cracked lighter useful products fractions processed refining units


unprocessed crude generally useful industrial applications although light sweet viscosity sulfur crude used directly burner fuel produce steam propulsion seagoing vessels lighter elements however form explosive vapors fuel tanks therefore hazardous especially warships instead hundreds different hydrocarbon molecules crude separated refinery components used fuels lubricants feedstocks petrochemical processes manufacture products plastics detergents solvents elastomers fibers nylon polyesters
petroleum fossil fuels burned internal combustion engines provide power ships automobiles aircraft engines lawn mowers dirt bikes machines different boiling points allow hydrocarbons separated distillation since lighter liquid products great demand internal combustion engines modern refinery convert heavy hydrocarbons lighter gaseous elements higher value products

sitinglocating petroleum refineriesedit
party searching site construct refinery chemical plant needs consider following issues

site reasonably residential areas
infrastructure available supply materials shipment products markets
energy operate plant available
facilities available waste disposal

refineries large amount steam cooling water need abundant source water refineries therefore often located nearby navigable rivers shore nearby port location also gives access transportation river advantages transporting crude pipeline evident companies often transport large volume fuel distribution terminals pipeline pipeline practical products small output rail cars road tankers barges used
petrochemical plants solvent manufacturing fine fractionating plants need spaces processing large volume refinery products processing chemical additives product source rather blending terminals
