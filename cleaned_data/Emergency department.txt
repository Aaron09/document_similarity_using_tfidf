historyedit
accident services already provided workmens compensation plans railway companies municipalities europe united states late midnineteenth century first specialized trauma care center world opened 1911 united states university louisville hospital louisville kentucky developed surgeon arnold griswold 1930s griswold also equipped police fire vehicles medical supplies trained officers give emergency care route hospital123
today typical hospital emergency department section ground floor grounds dedicated entrance patients present time complaint part operation emergency department prioritization cases based clinical need process called triage
triage normally first stage patient passes consists brief assessment including vital signs assignment chief complaint chest pain abdominal pain difficulty breathing emergency departments dedicated area process take place staff dedicated performing nothing triage role departments role fulfilled triage nurse although dependent training levels country area health care professionals perform triage sorting including paramedics physicians triage typically conducted facetoface patient presents form triage conducted radio ambulance crew method paramedics call hospitals triage center short update incoming patient triaged appropriate level care
patients initially assessed triage passed another area department another area hospital waiting time determined clinical need however patients complete treatment triage stage instance condition minor treated quickly advice required emergency department suitable point care patient conversely patients evidently serious conditions cardiac arrest bypass triage altogether move straight appropriate part department
resuscitation area commonly referred trauma resus area departments seriously injured patients dealt area contains equipment staff required dealing immediately lifethreatening illnesses injuries typical resuscitation staffing involves least attending physician least usually nurses trauma advanced cardiac life support training personnel assigned resuscitation area entirety shift call resuscitation coverage critical case presents walkin triage ambulance team paged resuscitation area deal case immediately resuscitation cases also attended residents radiographers ambulance personnel respiratory therapists hospital pharmacists andor students professions depending upon skill needed given case whether hospital provides teaching services
patients exhibit signs seriously immediate danger life limb triaged acute care majors seen physician receive thorough assessment treatment examples majors include chest pain difficulty breathing abdominal pain neurological complaints advanced diagnostic testing conducted stage including laboratory testing blood andor urine ultrasonography scanning medications appropriate manage patients condition also given depending underlying causes patients chief complaint discharged home area admitted hospital treatment
patients whose condition immediately lifethreatening sent area suitable deal areas might typically termed prompt care minors area patients still found significant problems including fractures dislocations lacerations requiring suturing
children present particular challenges treatment departments dedicated pediatrics areas departments employ play therapist whose children ease reduce anxiety caused visiting emergency department well provide distraction therapy simple procedures
many hospitals separate area evaluation psychiatric problems often staffed psychiatrists mental health nurses social workers typically least room people actively risk others suicidal

requires different equipment different approaches hospital divisions patients frequently arrive unstable conditions must treated quickly unconscious information medical history allergies blood type unavailable staff trained work quickly effectively even minimal information
staff must also interact efficiently prehospital care providers emts paramedics others occasionally based prehospital providers equipment unfamiliar average physician physicians must expert using safely removing specialized equipment since devices military antishock trousers mast traction splints require special procedures among reasons given must able handle specialized equipment physicians specialize emergency medicine employ many specialists
staff much common ambulance fire crews combat medics search rescue teams disaster response teams often joint training practice drills organized improve coordination complex response system busy exchange great deal equipment ambulance crews must provide replacing returning reimbursing costly items
cardiac arrest major trauma relatively common defibrillators automatic ventilation machines bleeding control dressings used heavily survival cases greatly enhanced shortening wait interventions recent years specialized equipment spread prehospital settings bestknown example defibrillators spread first ambulances automatic version police cars fire apparatus recently public spaces airports office buildings hotels even shopping malls
time essential factor emergency treatment typically diagnostic equipment avoid waiting equipment installed elsewhere hospital nearly radiographic examination rooms staffed dedicated radiographer many full radiology facilities including scanners ultrasonography equipment laboratory services handled priority basis hospital stat basic labs blood counts blood typing toxicology screens must returned rapidly
nonemergency useedit
metrics applicable grouped three main categories volume cycle time patient satisfaction volume metrics including arrivals hour percentage beds occupied patients understood basic level hospitals indication staffing requirements cycle time metrics mainstays evaluation tracking process efficiency less widespread since active effort needed collect analyze data patient satisfaction metrics already commonly collected nursing groups physician groups hospitals useful demonstrating impact changes patient perception care time since patient satisfaction metrics derivative subjective less useful primary process improvement health information exchanges reduce nonurgent visits supplying current data admissions discharges transfers health plans accountable care organizations allowing shift primary care settings24
primary care trusts hours medical consultations provided general practitioners nurse practitioners
united states many countries hospitals beginning create areas emergency rooms people minor injuries commonly referred fast track minor care units units people nonlifethreatening injuries units within department shown significantly improve flow patients department reduce waiting times urgent care clinics another alternative patients receive immediate care nonlifethreatening conditions reduce strain limited resources american medical response created checklist allows emts identify intoxicated individuals safely sent detoxification facilities instead25
overcrowdingedit
emergency department overcrowding function department hindered inability treat patients adequate manner common occurrence emergency departments worldwide26 overcrowding causes inadequate patient care leads poorer patient outcomes2627 address problem escalation policies used emergency departments responding increase demand sudden inflow patients reduction capacity lack beds admit patients policies maintain ability deliver patient care without compromising safety modifying â€˜normalâ€™ processes28
emergency department waiting timesedit
emergency department waiting times serious impact patient mortality morbidity readmission less days length stay patient satisfaction review literature bears logical premise since outcome treatment diseases injuries timesensitive sooner treatment rendered better outcome2930 various studies reported significant associations waiting times higher mortality morbidity among survived31 clear literature untimely hospital deaths morbidity reduced reductions waiting times32
exit blockedit
significant proportion people attending emergency departments discharged home treatment many require admission ongoing observation treatment ensure adequate social care discharge possible people requiring admission able moved inpatient beds swiftly exit block access block occurs often leads crowding impairs flow point lead delays appropriate treatment newly presenting cases arrival access block33 phenomenon common densely populated areas affects pediatric departments less adults ones33
exit block lead delays care people awaiting inpatient beds boarding newly present exit blocked department various solutions proposed changes staffing increasing inpatient capacity33
frequent presentersedit
frequent presenters persons present hospital multiple times usually complex medical requirements psychological issues complicating medical management34 persons contribute overcrowding typically require hospital resources although account significant amount visits35 help prevent inappropriate emergency department return visits hospitals offer care coordination support services athome inshelter transitional primary care frequent presenters shortterm housing homeless patients recovering discharge3637
