ancient geomorphologyedit
study landforms evolution earths surface dated back scholars classical greece herodotus argued observations soils nile delta actively growing mediterranean estimated age9 aristotle speculated sediment transport eventually seas would fill land lowered claimed would mean land water would eventually swap places whereupon process would begin endless cycle9

early modern geomorphologyedit
term geomorphology seems first used laumann 1858 work written german keith tinkler suggested word came general english german french john wesley powell mcgee used international geological conference 189113 john edward marr scientific study scenery14 considered book introductory treatise geomorphology subject sprung union geology geography
early popular geomorphic model geographical cycle cycle erosion model broadscale landscape evolution developed william morris davis 1884 18999 elaboration uniformitarianism theory first proposed james hutton 1726–179715 regard valley forms example uniformitarianism posited sequence river runs flat terrain gradually carving increasingly deep valley side valleys eventually erode flattening terrain though lower elevation thought tectonic uplift could start cycle decades following daviss development idea many studying geomorphology sought findings framework known today davisian15 daviss ideas historical importance largely superseded today mainly lack predictive power qualitative nature15
1920s walther penck developed alternative model daviss15 penck thought landform evolution better described alternation ongoing processes uplift denudation opposed daviss model single uplift followed decay16 also emphasised many landscapes slope evolution occurs backwearing rocks davisianstyle surface lowering science tended emphasise surface process understanding detail surface history given locality penck german lifetime ideas times rejected vigorously englishspeaking geomorphology community15 early death davis dislike work attimesconfusing writing style likely contributed rejection17
davis penck trying place study evolution earths surface generalized globally relevant footing previously early 19th century authors especially europe tended attribute form landscapes local climate particular specific effects glaciation periglacial processes contrast davis penck seeking emphasize importance evolution landscapes time generality earths surface processes across different landscapes different conditions
early 1900s study regionalscale geomorphology termed physiographycitation needed physiography later considered contraction physical geography therefore synonymous physical geography concept became embroiled controversy surrounding appropriate concerns discipline geomorphologists held geological basis physiography emphasized concept physiographic regions conflicting trend among geographers equate physiography pure morphology separated geological heritagecitation needed period following world emergence process climatic quantitative studies preference many earth scientists term geomorphology order suggest analytical approach landscapes rather descriptive one18
climatic geomorphologyedit
information climatic geomorphology
imperialism late 19th century european explorers scientists traveled across globe bringing descriptions landscapes landforms geographical knowledge increased time observations systematized search regional patterns climate emerged thus prime factor explaining landform distribution grand scale emergence climatic geomorphology foreshadowed work wladimir köppen vasily dokuchaev andreas schimper william morris davis leading geomorphologist time recognized role climate complementing normal temperate climate cycle erosion arid glacial ones1920 nevertheless interest climatic geomorphology also reaction davisian geomorphology mid20th century considered uninnovative dubious2021 early climatic geomorphology developed primarily continental europe englishspeaking world tendency explicit peltiers 1950 publication periglacial cycle erosion19
climatic geomorphology criticized 1969 review article process geomorphologist stoddart2022 criticism stoddart proved devastating sparking decline popularity climatic geomorphology late 20th century2022 stoddart criticized climatic geomorphology applying supposedly trivial methodologies establishing landform differences morphoclimatic zones linked davisian geomorphology allegedly neglecting fact physical laws governing processes across globe22 addition conceptions climatic geomorphology like holds chemical weathering rapid tropical climates cold climates proved straightforwardly true20
