reis born gelnhausen germany marie katharine glöckner karl sigismund reis master baker12 father belonged evangelical lutheran church3 reiss mother died infant raised paternal grandmother wellread intelligent woman reis sent common school home town gelnhausen talents attracted notice instructors advised father extend education higher college father died reis years grandmother guardians placed garniers institute friedrichsdorf showed taste languages acquired french english well stock miscellaneous information library4
fourteenth year reis accepted hassel institute frankfurt main learned latin italian love science became apparent guardians recommended send polytechnic school karlsruhe uncle wished become merchant march 1850 reis apprenticed paints dealer establishment beyerbach frankfurt told uncle would learn business chosen would continue preferred studies could4

reis telephone


reis imagined electricity could propagated space light without material conductor performed experiments subject results described paper radiation electricity 1859 mailed professor poggendorff insertion wellknown periodical annalen physik manuscript rejected great disappointment sensitive young teacher4
reis like bell would later studied organs idea apparatus transmitting sound means electricity floated mind years inspired physics lessons attacked problem rewarded success 1860 constructed first prototype telephone could cover distance meters 1862 tried interest poggendorff account telephon called second offering also rejected like first learned professor seems regarded transmission speech electricity chimera reis bitterly attributed failure poor schoolmaster4
reis difficulty interesting people germany invention despite demonstrating among others wilhelm legat inspector royal prussian telegraph corps 18626 aroused interest united states 1872 professor vanderwyde demonstrated york
prior 1947 reis device tested british company standard telephones cables results also confirmed could faintly transmit receive speech time bidding contract alexander graham bells american telephone telegraph company results covered stcs chairman frank gill maintain bells reputation5

reis monument gelnhausen 1878 european scientists declared reis telephones inventor


since invention telephone attention called fact 1854 charles bourseul french telegraphist conceived plan conveying sounds even speech electricity

suppose speaks near movable disc sufficiently flexible lose none vibrations voice disc alternately makes breaks currents battery distance another disc simultaneously execute vibrations certain less distant future speech transmitted electricity made experiments direction delicate demand time patience approximations obtained promise favourable resultcitation needed

bourseul deserves credit perhaps first devise electric telephone make reis deserves honor first realising idea device transmit receive sounds electrically
bourseuls idea seems attracted little notice time soon forgotten even count moncel ever ready welcome promising invention evidently regarded fantastic notion doubtful reis ever heard reis conceive similar apparatus study mechanism human knew contained membrane vibrated sound waves communicated vibrations hammerbone behind auditory nerve therefore occurred made diaphragm imitate membrane caused vibrating make break circuit electric current would able magnetic power interrupted current reproduce original sounds distance
183738 professor page massachusetts discovered needle thin iron placed hollow coil bobbin insulated wire would emit audible tick interruption current flowing coil separate ticks followed fast enough rapid interruption current would together continuous gave name galvanic music also found pitch note corresponded rate currents interruption faint sounds magnetostriction discoveries noad wertheim marrian others reis knew current interrupted vibrating diaphragm conveyed distance wires passed coil like pages iron needle would emit notes like caused oscillation transmitting diaphragm acting knowledge constructed rudimentary telephone reis prototype museum reichs postamt berlin
shortcomingsedit




reis’ selfportraiture telephones seventh version demonstrated free german institute frankfurt 1862


another early transmitters rough model human carved provided drum actuated bent pivoted lever platinum making open close springy contact platinum foil metallic circuit current devised twelve different forms improvement predecessors transmitted music fairly well even word speech less fidelity
discovery microphone professor hughes demonstrated reason failure reis transmitter based interrupting current spring intended close contact opened shock vibration long sound musical tone proved efficient musical tone regular succession vibrations vibrations speech irregular complicated order transmit current varied strength without altogether broken waves excited voice merely produce corresponding waves current short current ought undulate sympathy oscillations reis phone poor transmitting articulated speech able convey pitch sound
appears report herr legat inspector royal prussian telegraphs published 1862 reis quite aware principle instrument well adapted apply doubt platinum contacts employed transmitter behaved extent crude metal microphone hence words especially familiar expected ones could transmitted distinguished line reis phone adjusted contact points made loose metallic contact would function much like later telephone invented berliner hughes microphone form iron nails loose contact thus reis phone worked best speech slightly adjustment
history telephone 1910 records course dolbear lawsuit reis machine brought court created much amusement able squeak speak experts professors wrestled vain refused transmit intelligible sentence speak wont’ explained dolbears lawyers generally known reis machine clogged order would transmit word imperfect built wrong lines telephone wagon sleigh even though possible chain wheels make slide foot said judge lowell rendering famous decision

century reis would never produced speaking telephone mere improvement construction left bell discover failure workmanship principle adopted basis done …bell discovered art—that transmitting speech electricity claim broad invention follow reis fail follow bell succeed7

reis seem realised importance entirely breaking circuit current events metal spring practical allowed metal contacts jolt apart thus interrupt electric current
experiments made little workshop behind home friedrichsdorf wires upper chamber another line erected physical cabinet garniers institute across playground classrooms tradition school boys afraid creating uproar room fear philipp reis would hear telephon
publicationedit
reis invention articulated lecture physical society frankfurt october 1861 description written jahresbericht month later created good deal scientific excitement germany models sent abroad london dublin tiflis places became subject popular lectures article scientific cabinets
reis obtained brief renown rejection soon physical society frankfurt turned back apparatus given lustre reis resigned 1867 free german institute frankfurt elected honorary member also slighted instrument mere philosophical
reis believed invention even else encouraged peers beginning might perfected already stricken tuberculosis however reis gave lecture telephone gießen 1854 poggendorff present invited send description instrument annalen reis said replied danke ihnen sehr herr professor aber spät jetzt nicht schicken mein apparat wird ohne beschreibung annalen bekannt werden thank much professor late want send apparatus become known without description annalen
