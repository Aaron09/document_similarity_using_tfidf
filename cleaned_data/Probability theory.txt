historyedit
main article history probability
mathematical theory probability roots attempts analyze games chance gerolamo cardano sixteenth century pierre fermat blaise pascal seventeenth century example problem points christiaan huygens published book subject 16573 19th century pierre laplace completed today considered classic interpretation4
initially probability theory mainly considered discrete events methods mainly combinatorial eventually analytical considerations compelled incorporation continuous variables theory
culminated modern probability theory foundations laid andrey nikolaevich kolmogorov kolmogorov combined notion sample space introduced richard mises measure theory presented axiom system probability theory 1933 became mostly undisputed axiomatic basis modern probability theory alternatives exist adoption finite rather countable additivity bruno finetti5
treatmentedit
introductions probability theory treat discrete probability distributions continuous probability distributions separately mathematically advanced measure theorybased treatment probability covers discrete continuous
motivationedit
consider experiment produce number outcomes outcomes called sample space experiment power sample space equivalently event space formed considering different collections possible results example rolling honest produces possible results collection possible results corresponds getting number thus subset element power sample space rolls collections called events case event falls number results actually occur fall given event event said occurred
probability assigning every event value zero requirement event made possible results example event 123456 assigned value qualify probability distribution assignment values must satisfy requirement look collection mutually exclusive events events contain common results events mutually exclusive probability events occurs given probabilities events6
probability events occur saying probability event 12346 event encompasses possibility number except five rolled mutually exclusive event probability event 123456 probability absolute certainty
