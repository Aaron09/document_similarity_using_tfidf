homology analogyedit




sycamore maple fruits wings analogous homologous birds


information convergent evolution
opposite homologous organs analogous organs similar jobs taxa present last common ancestor rather evolved separately example wings insects birds evolved independently widely separated groups converged functionally support powered flight analogous similarly wings sycamore maple seed wings bird analogous homologous develop quite different structures1213 structure homologous level analogous another pterosaur bird wings analogous wings homologous forelimbs organ served forearm wing last common ancestor tetrapods evolved different ways three groups thus pterosaurs wing involves forelimb hindlimb14 analogy called homoplasy cladistics convergent parallel evolution evolutionary biology1516
cladisticsedit
information cladistics
specialised terms used taxonomic research primary homology initial hypothesis made researcher based similar structure anatomical connections inferring characters share ancestry secondary homology implied parsimony analysis character occurs tree taken homologous17 implied definition many cladists consider homology synonymous synapomorphy shared derived character trait state distinguishes clade organisms18

information model flower development
four types flower parts namely carpels stamens petals sepals homologous derived leaves goethe correctly noted 1790 development parts pattern gene expression growing zones meristems described model flower development four types flower parts serially repeated concentric whorls controlled small number genes acting various combinations thus genes working alone result sepal formation together produce petals together create stamens alone produces carpels none genes active leaves formed groups genes form ovules floral whorls complete model genes evidently ancient flowering plants themselves3
