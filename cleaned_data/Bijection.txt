definitionedit
details notation function mathematics notation
pairing need different bijection four properties must hold

element must paired least element
element paired element
element must paired least element
element paired element

satisfying properties means bijection function domain common properties written single statement every element paired exactly element functions satisfy property said onto called surjections surjective functions functions satisfy property said onetoone functions called injections injective functions1 terminology bijection function surjection injection using words bijection function onetoone onto
bijections sometimes denoted twoheaded rightwards arrow tail u2916 rightwards twoheaded arrow tail symbol combination twoheaded rightwards arrow u21a0 rightwards headed arrow sometimes used denote surjections rightwards arrow barbed tail u21a3 rightwards arrow tail sometimes used denote injections
examplesedit
batting lineup baseball cricket teamedit
consider batting lineup baseball cricket team list players sports team every player holds specific spot lineup players team size nine case baseball positions batting order pairing given player position order property satisfied since player somewhere list property satisfied since player bats positions order property says position order player batting position property states players never batting position list
seats students classroomedit
classroom certain number seats bunch students enter room instructor asks seated quick look around room instructor declares bijection students seats student paired seat sitting instructor observed order reach conclusion

every student seat standing
student seat
every seat someone sitting empty seats
seat student

instructor able conclude many seats students without count either

identity function bijective
function bijective since unique generality linear function reals nonzero bijection real number obtained paired real number
function given arctanx bijective since real number paired exactly angle interval tany arctanx codomain made larger include integer multiple function would longer onto surjective since real number could paired multiple arctan function
exponential function bijective instance showing onto surjective however codomain restricted positive real numbers

bijections cardinalityedit
finite sets exists bijection sets number elements indeed axiomatic theory taken definition number elements equinumerosity generalising definition infinite sets leads concept cardinal number distinguish various sizes infinite sets

bijective functions together operation functional composition form group symmetric group denoted variously factorial

bijections category theoryedit
bijections precisely isomorphisms category sets functions however bijections always isomorphisms complex categories example category groups morphisms must homomorphisms since must preserve group structure isomorphisms group isomorphisms bijective homomorphisms
generalization partial functionsedit
notion onetoone correspondence generalizes partial functions called partial bijections although partial bijections required injective reason relaxation proper partial function already undefined portion domain thus compelling reason constrain inverse total function defined everywhere domain partial bijections given base called symmetric inverse semigroup2
another defining notion partial bijection relation turns partial function property graph bijection fa′→b′ subset subset
partial bijection sometimes called onetoone partial transformation4 example möbius transformation simply defined complex plane rather completion extended complex plane5
