harmonics also called overtones partials upper partials difference harmonic overtone term harmonic includes notes series including fundamental frequency open string guitar term overtone includes pitches fundamental music contexts terms harmonic overtone partial used fairly interchangeably
characteristicsedit
acoustic instruments emit complex tones containing many individual partials component simple tones sinusoidal waves untrained human typically perceive partials separate phenomena rather musical note perceived sound quality timbre sound result relative strengths individual partials many acoustic oscillators human voice bowed violin string produce complex tones less periodic thus composed partials near matches integer multiples fundamental frequency therefore resemble ideal harmonics called harmonic partials simply harmonics convenience although strictly accurate call partial harmonic first real second ideal
oscillators produce harmonic partials behave somewhat like onedimensional resonators often long thin guitar string column open ends modern orchestral transverse flute wind instruments whose column open trumpets clarinets also produce partials resembling harmonics however produce partials matching harmonics least theory reality acoustic instruments none behaves perfectly somewhat simplified theoretical models would predict
partials whose frequencies integer multiples fundamental referred inharmonic partials acoustic instruments emit harmonic inharmonic partials still produce effect definite fundamental pitch pianos strings plucked pizzicato vibraphones marimbas certain puresounding bells chimes antique singing bowls known producing multiple harmonic partials multiphonics oscillators cymbals drum heads percussion instruments naturally produce abundance inharmonic partials imply particular pitch therefore cannot used melodically harmonically instruments
partials overtones harmonicsedit
overtone partial higher lowest partial compound tone relative strengths frequency relationships component partials determine timbre instrument similarity terms overtone partial sometimes leads loosely used interchangeably musical context counted differently leading possible confusion special case instrumental timbres whose component partials closely match harmonic series strings winds rather inharmonic partials pitched percussion instruments also convenient call component partials harmonics strictly correct harmonics numbered even missing partials overtones counted present chart demonstrates three types names partial overtone harmonic counted assuming harmonics present
