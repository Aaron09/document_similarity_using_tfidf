engineers develop technological solutions engineering design process responsibilities engineer include defining problems conducting narrowing research analyzing criteria finding analyzing solutions making decisions much engineers time spent researching locating applying transferring information7 indeed research suggests engineers spend time engaged various information behaviours including actively searching information8
engineers must weigh different design choices merits choose solution best matches requirements crucial unique task identify understand interpret constraints design order produce successful result
analysisedit




engineers conferring prototype design 1954


engineers apply techniques engineering analysis testing production maintenance analytical engineers supervise production factories elsewhere determine causes process failure test output maintain quality also estimate time cost required complete projects supervisory engineers responsible major components entire projects engineering analysis involves application scientific analytic principles processes reveal properties state system device mechanism study engineering analysis proceeds separating engineering design mechanisms operation failure analyzing estimating component operation failure mechanism isolation recombining components analyze risk9101112
many engineers computers produce analyze designs simulate test machine structure system operates generate specifications parts monitor quality products control efficiency processes

engineers specialize engineering disciplines1 numerous specialties recognized professional societies major branches engineering numerous subdivisions civil engineering example includes structural transportation engineering materials engineering include ceramic metallurgical polymer engineering mechanical engineering cuts across every discipline since core essence applied physics engineers also specialize industry motor vehicles type technology turbines semiconductor materials1
several recent studies investigated engineers spend time work tasks perform time distributed among research813 suggests several themes present engineers’ work technical work application science product development social work interactive communication people computerbased work information behaviours amongst detailed findings recent work sampling study13 found engineers spend 6292 time engaged technical work 4037 social work 4966 computerbased work furthermore considerable overlap different types work engineers spending 2496 time engaged technical social work 3797 technical nonsocial 1542 nontechnical social 2166 nontechnical nonsocial
engineering also informationintensive field research finding engineers spend time engaged various different information behaviours including actively seeking information people information repositories documents databases
time engineers spend engaged activities also reflected competencies required engineering roles addition engineers’ core technical competence research also demonstrated critical nature personal attributes project management skills cognitive abilities success role14
