miscarriage abortionedit
also miscarriage abortion




complete spontaneous abortion weeks conception weeks


embryos survive next stage development happens naturally called spontaneous abortion miscarriage11 many reasons occur common natural cause miscarriage chromosomal abnormality animals12 genetic load plants13
species produce multiple embryos time miscarriage abortion embryos provide remaining embryos greater share maternal resources also disturb pregnancy causing harm second embryo genetic strains miscarry embryos source commercial seedless fruits
abortion process artificially nonnaturally removing embryo deliberate pharmaceutical surgical methods
