majority regions mediterranean climates relatively mild winters warm summers however winter summer temperatures vary greatly different regions mediterranean climate instance case winters lisbon angeles experience mild temperatures winter frost snowfall almost unknown whereas tashkent colder winters annual frosts snowfall consider summer athens experiences rather high temperatures season measured nearby eleusis contrast francisco cool summers daily highs around continuous upwelling cold subsurface waters along coast coast california also produces regular summer cool moist ocean coming contact highpressure
regions mediterranean climate near large bodies water temperatures generally moderate comparatively small range temperatures winter summer high although daily range temperature summer large clear conditions except along immediate coasts temperatures winter occasionally fall freezing point snow generally seldom seen summer temperatures range mild depending distance large body water elevation latitude even warmest locations mediterraneantype climate however temperatures usually reach highest readings found adjacent desert regions cooling water bodies although strong winds inland desert regions sometimes boost summer temperatures quickly increasing risk wildfires
