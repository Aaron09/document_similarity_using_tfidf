descriptionedit
library classification aspect library information science distinct scientific classification goal provide useful ordering documents rather theoretical organization knowledge2 although practical purpose creating physical ordering documents generally attempt adhere accepted scientific knowledge3
library classification distinct application subject headings classification organizes knowledge systematic order subject headings provide access intellectual materials vocabulary terms organized knowledge system4 characteristics bibliographic classification demands sake reaching purposes useful sequence subjects levels concise memorable notation host techniques devices number synthesis5
historyedit
library classifications preceded classifications used bibliographers conrad gessner earliest library classification schemes organized books broad subject categories increase available printed materials made broad classification unworkable granular classifications library materials developed nineteenth century6
although libraries created order within collections early fifth century paris booksellers classification developed 1842 jacques charles brunet generally seen first modern book classifications brunet provided five major classes theology jurisprudence sciences arts belleslettres history7
typesedit
many standard systems library classification many proposed years however general classification systems divided three types depending used

specific classification schemes cover particular subjects types materials example iconclass british catalogue music classification dickinson classification classification medicine
national schemes specially created certain countries example swedish library classification system sveriges allmänna biblioteksförening

practice classifyingedit
library classification associated library descriptive cataloging rubric cataloging classification sometimes grouped together technical services library professional engages process cataloging classifying library materials called cataloger catalog librarian library classification systems tools used facilitate subject access consists alphabetical indexing languages thesauri subject headings systems
library classification piece work consists steps firstly aboutness material ascertained next call number essentially books address based classification system particular library assigned work using notation system
important note unlike subject heading thesauri multiple terms assigned work library classification systems work placed class shelving purposes book physical place however classified catalogs main entries well added entries classification systems like dewey decimal classification library congress classification also cutter number work adds code author work
classification systems libraries generally play roles firstly facilitate subject access allowing user find works documents library certain subject8 secondly provide known location information source located shelved
19th century libraries closed stacks library classification served organize subject catalog 20th century libraries opened stacks public started shelve library material according library classification simplify subject browsing
classification systems suitable aiding subject access rather shelf location example universal decimal classification uses complicated notation pluses colons difficult purpose shelf arrangement expressive compared terms showing relationships subjects similarly faceted classification schemes difficult shelf arrangement unless user knowledge citation order
depending size library collection libraries might classification systems solely purpose extreme cases public library small collection might classification system location resources might complicated subject classification system instead resources might couple wide classes travel crime magazines known mark park classification method formally called reader interest classification9
