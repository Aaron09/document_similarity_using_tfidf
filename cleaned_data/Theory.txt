ancient usesedit
english word theory derived technical term philosophy ancient greek everyday word theoria θεωρία meant looking viewing beholding technical contexts came refer contemplative speculative understandings natural things natural philosophers opposed practical ways knowing things like skilled orators artisans6 word english since least late 16th century7 modern uses word theory derived original definition taken shades meaning still based idea theory thoughtful rational explanation general nature things
although mundane meanings greek word θεωρία apparently developed special uses early recorded history greek language book religion philosophy francis cornford suggests orphics used word theory mean passionate sympathetic contemplation8 pythagoras changed word mean passionate sympathetic contemplation mathematical knowledge considered intellectual pursuit reach highest plane existence pythagoras emphasized subduing emotions bodily desires help intellect function higher plane theory thus pythagoras gave word theory specific meaning classical modern concept distinction theory uninvolved neutral thinking practice9
aristotles terminology already mentioned theory contrasted praxis practice remains case today aristotle practice theory involve thinking aims different theoretical contemplation considers things humans move change nature human apart knowledge helps create hand praxis involves thinking always desired actions whereby humans cause change movement ends human movement involves conscious choice thinking could example praxis doing10
theories formally scientificallyedit
main article theory mathematical logic
theories analytical tools understanding explaining making predictions given subject matter theories many varied fields study including arts sciences formal theory syntactic nature meaningful given semantic component applying content facts relationships actual historical world unfolding theories various fields study expressed natural language always constructed general form identical theory expressed formal language mathematical logic theories expressed mathematically symbolically common language generally expected follow principles rational thought logic
theory constructed sentences entirely true statements subject consideration however truth statements always relative whole theory therefore statement true respect theory true respect another ordinary language statements terrible person cannot judged true false without reference interpretation matter terrible person theory11
sometimes theories exactly explanatory power make predictions pair theories called indistinguishable observationally equivalent choice reduces convenience philosophical preference
form theories studied formally mathematical logic especially model theory theories studied mathematics usually expressed formal language statements closed application certain procedures called rules inference special case axiomatic theory consists axioms axiom schemata rules inference theorem statement derived axioms application rules inference theories used applications abstractions observed phenomena resulting theorems provide solutions realworld problems obvious examples include arithmetic abstracting concepts number geometry concepts space probability concepts randomness likelihood
gödels incompleteness theorem shows consistent recursively enumerable theory whose theorems form recursively enumerable concept natural numbers expressed include true statements result domains knowledge cannot formalized accurately completely mathematical theories formalizing accurately completely means true propositions—and true propositions—are derivable within mathematical system limitation however precludes construction mathematical theories formalize large bodies scientific knowledge
underdeterminationedit
main article underdetermination
theory underdetermined also called indeterminacy data theory rival inconsistent theory least consistent evidence underdetermination epistemological issue relation evidence conclusions
theory lacks supporting evidence generally properly referred hypothesis
intertheoretic reduction eliminationedit
main article intertheoretic reduction
theory better explains predicts phenomenon theory explanatory power justified believing newer theory describes reality correctly called intertheoretic reduction terms theory reduced terms instance historical understanding sound light heat reduced wave compressions rarefactions electromagnetic waves molecular kinetic energy respectively terms identified called intertheoretic identities theory parallel conclude describes reality completely
theory uses terms reduce terms older theory rather replace misrepresent reality called intertheoretic elimination instance obsolete scientific theory forward understanding heat transfer terms movement caloric fluid eliminated theory heat energy replaced also theory phlogiston substance released burning rusting material eliminated understanding reactivity oxygen
theories theoremsedit
theories distinct theorems theorem derived deductively axioms basic assumptions according formal system rules sometimes sometimes first step toward tested applied concrete situation theorems said true sense conclusions theorem logical consequences axioms theories abstract conceptual supported challenged observations world rigorously tentative meaning proposed true expected satisfy careful examination account possibility faulty inference incorrect observation sometimes theories incorrect meaning explicit observations contradicts fundamental objection application theory often theories corrected conform observations restricting class phenomena theory applies changing assertions made example former restriction classical mechanics phenomena involving macroscopic length scales particle speeds much lower speed light
scientific theoriesedit
main article scientific theory
science term theory refers wellsubstantiated explanation aspect natural world based body facts repeatedly confirmed observation experiment1213 theories must also meet requirements ability make falsifiable predictions consistent accuracy across broad area scientific inquiry production strong evidence favor theory multiple independent sources
strength scientific theory related diversity phenomena explain measured ability make falsifiable predictions respect phenomena theories improved replaced better theories evidence gathered accuracy prediction improves time increased accuracy corresponds increase scientific knowledge scientists theories foundation gain scientific knowledge well accomplish goals inventing technology curing disease
definitions scientific organizationsedit
united states national academy sciences defines scientific theories follows

formal scientific definition theory quite different everyday meaning word refers comprehensive explanation aspect nature supported vast body evidence many scientific theories well established evidence likely alter substantially example evidence demonstrate earth orbit around heliocentric theory living things made cells cell theory matter composed atoms surface earth divided solid plates moved geological timescales theory plate tectonicsone useful properties scientific theories used make predictions natural events phenomena observed14

note term theory would appropriate describing untested intricate hypotheses even scientific models
philosophical viewsedit
logical positivists thought scientific theories deductive theories—that theorys content based formal system logic basic axioms deductive theory sentence logical consequence axioms also sentence theory11 called received view theories
semantic view theories largely replaced received view1516 theories viewed scientific models model logical framework intended represent reality model reality similar graphical model represents territory city country approach theories specific category models fulfill necessary criteria theories models discussion
physicsedit
physics term theory generally used mathematical framework—derived small basic postulates usually symmetries like equality locations space time identity electrons etc—which capable producing experimental predictions given category physical systems good example classical electromagnetism encompasses results derived gauge symmetry sometimes called gauge invariance form equations called maxwells equations specific mathematical aspects classical electromagnetic theory termed laws electromagnetism reflecting level consistent reproducible evidence supports within electromagnetic theory generally numerous hypotheses electromagnetism applies specific situations many hypotheses already considered adequately tested ones always making perhaps untested
term theoreticaledit
acceptance theory require major predictions tested already supported sufficiently strong evidence example certain tests unfeasible technically difficult result theories make predictions confirmed proven incorrect case predicted results described informally term theoretical predictions tested later time incorrect lead revision rejection theory
philosophical theoriesedit
main article philosophical theory
theory either descriptive science prescriptive normative philosophy18 latter whose subject matter consists empirical data rather ideas least elementary theorems philosophical theory statements whose truth cannot necessarily scientifically tested empirical observation
field study sometimes named theory basis initial assumptions describing fields approach subject assumptions elementary theorems particular theory thought axioms field commonly known examples include theory number theory however literary theory critical theory music theory also form
metatheoryedit
main article metatheory
form philosophical theory metatheory metatheory metatheory theory whose subject matter theory theories words theory theories statements made metatheory theory called metatheorems
political theoriesedit
main article political theory
political theory ethical theory government often term political theory refers general view specific ethic political belief attitude politics
jurisprudential theoriesedit
main articles jurisprudence
social science jurisprudence philosophical theory contemporary philosophy addresses problems internal legal systems problems particular social institution
