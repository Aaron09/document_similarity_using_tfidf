evolutionary historyedit
occurrenceedit
multicellularity evolved independently least times56 including prokaryotes like cyanobacteria myxobacteria actinomycetes magnetoglobus multicellularis methanosarcina however complex multicellular organisms evolved eukaryotic groups animals fungi brown algae algae green algae land plants7 evolved repeatedly chloroplastida green algae land plants twice animals brown algae three times fungi chytrids ascomycetes basidiomycetes8 perhaps several times slime molds algae9 first evidence multicellularity cyanobacterialike organisms lived 3–35 billion years ago5 reproduce true multicellular organisms must solve problem regenerating whole organism germ cells sperm cells issue studied evolutionary developmental biology animals evolved considerable diversity cell types multicellular body 100–150 different cell types compared 10–20 plants fungi10
loss multicellularityedit
loss multicellularity occurred groups11 fungi predominantly multicellular though early diverging lineages largely unicellular microsporidia numerous reversions unicellularity across fungi saccharomycotina cryptococcus yeasts1213 also occurred algae porphyridium possible primitively unicellular14 loss multicellularity also considered probable green algae chlorella vulgaris ulvophyceae1516 groups generally parasites reduction multicellularity occurred number types cells myxozoans multicellular organisms earlier thought unicellular probably extremely reduced cnidarians17
canceredit
multicellular organisms especially longliving animals face challenge cancer occurs cells fail regulate growth within normal program development changes tissue morphology observed process cancer animals metazoans often described loss multicellularity18 discussion possibility existence cancer multicellular organisms1920 even protozoa21 example plant galls characterized tumors22 authors argue plants develop cancer23
separation somatic germ cellsedit
multicellular groups called weismannists separation sterile somatic cell line germ cell line evolved however weismannist development relatively rare vertebrates arthropods volvox great part species capacity somatic embryogenesis land plants algae many invertebrates2425

hypothesis origin multicellularity group functionspecific cells aggregated sluglike mass called grex moved multicellular unit essentially slime molds another hypothesis primitive cell underwent nucleus division thereby becoming coenocyte membrane would form around nucleus cellular space organelles occupied space thereby resulting group connected cells organism mechanism observable drosophila third hypothesis unicellular organism divided daughter cells failed separate resulting conglomeration identical cells organism could later develop specialized tissues plant animal embryos well colonial choanoflagellates2627

evolution multicellularity could occurred number different ways described
symbiotic theoryedit
theory suggests first multicellular organisms occurred symbiosis cooperation different species singlecell organisms different roles time organisms would become dependent would able survive independently eventually leading incorporation genomes multicellular organism31 respective organism would become separate lineage differentiated cells within newly created species
kind severely codependent symbiosis seen frequently relationship clown fish riterri anemones cases extremely doubtful whether either species would survive long became extinct however problem theory still known organisms could incorporated single genome constitute single species although symbiosis theorized occurred mitochondria chloroplasts animal plant cells—endosymbiosis happened extremely rarely even genomes endosymbionts retained element distinction separately replicating mitosis host species instance three symbiotic organisms forming composite lichen although dependent survival separately reproduce reform create individual organism
cellularization syncytial theoryedit
theory states single unicellular organism multiple nuclei could developed internal membrane partitions around nuclei32 many protists ciliates slime molds several nuclei lending support hypothesis however simple presence multiple nuclei enough support theory multiple nuclei ciliates dissimilar clear differentiated functions macronucleus serves organisms needs whereas micronucleus used sexual reproduction exchange genetic material slime molds syncitia form individual amoeboid cells like syncitial tissues multicellular organisms round deemed valid theory needs demonstrable example mechanism generation multicellular organism preexisting syncytium
colonial theoryedit
colonial theory haeckel 1874 proposes symbiosis many organisms species unlike symbiotic theory suggests symbiosis different species multicellular organism least presumed landevolved multicellularity occurs cells separating rejoining cellular slime molds whereas majority multicellular types evolved within aquatic environments multicellularity occurs consequence cells failing separate following division33 mechanism latter colony formation simple incomplete cytokinesis though multicellularity also typically considered involve cellular differentiation34







advantage colonial theory hypothesis seen occur independently different protoctistan phyla instance food shortages amoeba dictyostelium groups together colony moves location amoeba slightly differentiate examples colonial organisation protista volvocaceae eudorina volvox latter consists 500–50000 cells depending species fraction reproduce35 example species 25–35 cells reproduce asexually around 15–25 sexually however often hard separate colonial protists true multicellular organisms concepts distinct colonial protists dubbed pluricellular rather multicellular3
synzoospore theoryedit
authors suggest origin multicellularity least metazoa occurred transition temporal spatial cell differentiation rather gradual evolution cell differentiation affirmed haeckel’s gastraea theory36
gkpidedit
million years ago37 minor genetic change single molecule called guanylate kinase proteininteraction domain gkpid allowed organisms single cell organism many cells38
role virusesedit
genes borrowed viruses recently identified playing crucial role differentiation multicellular tissues organs even sexual reproduction fusion cell sperm fused cells also involved metazoan membranes prevent chemicals crossing placenta brain body separation viral components identified first syncytin came virus second identified 2007 called eff1 helps form skin caenorhabditis elegans part whole family proteins felix pasteur institute paris constructed structure eff1 protein39 shown work linking cell another viral infections fact known cell fusion molecules viral origin suggests vitally important intercellular communication systems enabled multicellularity without ability cellular fusion colonies could formed anything even complex sponge would possible40
advantagesedit
multicellularity allows organism exceed size limits normally imposed diffusion single cells increased size decreased surfacetovolume ratio difficulty absorbing sufficient nutrients transporting throughout cell multicellular organisms thus competitive advantages increase size without limitations longer lifespans continue living individual cells multicellularity also permits increasing complexity allowing differentiation cell types within organism
