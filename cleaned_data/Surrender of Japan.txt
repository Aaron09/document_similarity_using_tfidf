although suzuki might indeed seen peace distant goal design achieve within immediate time span terms acceptable allies comments conference senior statesmen gave hint favored early cessation suzukis selections critical cabinet posts exception advocates peace either21

suzuki others government apologists claimed secretly working towards peace could publicly advocate cite japanese concept haragei—the hidden invisible technique—to justify dissonance public actions alleged behindthescenes work however many historians reject robert butow wrote

ambiguity plea haragei invites suspicion questions politics diplomacy conscious reliance upon bluff constituted purposeful deception predicated upon desire play ends middle judgment accord muchlauded character admiral suzuki fact remains moment became premier resigned could ever quite sure suzuki would next22

japanese leaders always envisioned negotiated settlement prewar planning expected rapid expansion consolidation eventual conflict united states finally settlement would able retain least territory conquered23 1945 japans leaders agreement going badly disagreed best means negotiate camps socalled peace camp favored diplomatic initiative persuade joseph stalin leader soviet union mediate settlement allies japan hardliners favored fighting last decisive battle would inflict many casualties allies would willing offer lenient terms1 approaches based japans experience russo–japanese forty years earlier consisted series costly largely indecisive battles followed decisive naval battle tsushima24
