17th century italian marcello malpighi invented first microscopes studying tiny biological entities malpighi analysed several parts organs bats frogs animals microscope malpighi studying structure lung noticed membranous alveoli hairlike connections veins arteries named capillaries discovery established oxygen breathe enters blood stream serves body1
19th century histology academic discipline right french anatomist bichat introduced concept tissue anatomy 1801 term histology first appeared book karl meyer 18192345
1906 nobel prize physiology medicine awarded histologists camillo golgi santiago ramon cajal dueling interpretations neural structure brain based differing interpretations images cajal prize correct theory golgi staining technique invented make possible

four basic types animal tissues muscle tissue nervous tissue connective tissue epithelial tissue tissue types subtypes four basic tissue types example blood classified connective tissue since blood cells suspended extracellular matrix plasma

epithelium lining glands bowel skin organs like liver lung kidney
endothelium lining blood lymphatic vessels
mesothelium lining pleural pericardial spaces
mesenchyme cells filling spaces organs including muscle bone cartilage tendon cells
blood cells white blood cells including found lymph nodes spleen
neurons conducting cells nervous system
germ cells reproductive cells spermatozoa oocytes women
placenta organ characteristic true mammals pregnancy joining mother offspring providing endocrine secretion selective exchange soluble particulate bloodborne substances apposition uterine trophoblastic vascularised parts
stem cells cells ability develop different cell types

fixingedit
chemical fixation formaldehyde chemicalsedit
main article fixation histology
chemical fixatives used preserve tissue degradation maintain structure cell subcellular components cell organelles nucleus endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria common fixative light microscopy neutral buffered formalin formaldehyde phosphate buffered saline electron microscopy commonly used fixative glutaraldehyde usually solution phosphate buffered saline fixatives preserve tissues cells mainly irreversibly crosslinking proteins main action aldehyde fixatives crosslink amino groups proteins formation methylene bridges case formaldehyde c5h10 crosslinks case glutaraldehyde process preserving structural integrity cells tissue damage biological functionality proteins particularly enzymes also denature certain extent detrimental certain histological techniques fixatives often used electron microscopy osmium tetroxide uranyl acetate
formalin fixation leads degradation mrna mirna well denaturation modification proteins tissues however extraction analysis nucleic acids proteins formalinfixed paraffinembedded tissues possible using appropriate protocols67
frozen section fixationedit
frozen section procedure rapid mount histology sections using refrigeration device called cryostat often used surgical removal tumors allow rapid determination margin tumor completely removed
processing dehydration clearing infiltrationedit
tissue processing remove water tissues replace medium solidifies allow thin sections biological tissue must supported hard matrix allow sufficiently thin sections typically micrometres 1000 micrometres thick light microscopy 80100 nanometre 1000000 nanometres thick electron microscopy light microscopy paraffin frequently used since immiscible water main constituent biological tissue water must first removed process dehydration samples transferred baths progressively concentrated ethanol remove water followed hydrophobic clearing agent xylene remove alcohol finally molten paraffin infiltration agent replaces xylene paraffin provide sufficiently hard matrix cutting thin sections electron microscopy instead resins used epoxy resins commonly employed embedding media acrylic resins also used particularly immunohistochemistry required thicker sections 035μm resinembedded tissue also light microscopy immiscibility epoxy acrylic resins water necessitates dehydration usually ethanol
embeddingedit




embedding optimal cutting temperature compound


tissues dehydrated cleared infiltrated embedding material ready external embedding process tissue samples placed molds along liquid embedding material agar gelatine hardened achieved cooling case paraffin heating curing case epoxy resins acrylic resins polymerised heat ultraviolet light chemical catalysts hardened blocks containing tissue samples ready sectioned
formalinfixed paraffinembedded ffpe tissues stored indefinitely room temperature nucleic acids recovered decades fixation ffpe tissues important resource historical studies medicine
embedding also accomplished using frozen nonfixed tissue waterbased medium prefrozen tissues placed molds liquid embedding material usually waterbased glycol cryogel resin frozen form hardened blocks
sectioningedit
main article microtome
light microscopy steel knife mounted microtome used 4micrometerthick tissue sections mounted glass microscope slide transmission electron microscopy diamond knife mounted ultramicrotome used 50nanometerthick tissue sections mounted 3millimeterdiameter copper grid mounted sections treated appropriate stain
sections tissue number directions pathological evaluation tissues vertical sectioning perpendicular surface tissue produce cross section usual method horizontal also known transverse longitudinal sectioning along long axis tissue often used evaluation hair follicles pilosebaceous units tangential horizontal sectioning used mohs surgery methods ccpdma
cryosectioningedit
main article frozen section procedure
fixed unfixed tissue frozen sliced using microtome mounted refrigeration device known cryostat frozen sections mounted glass slide stained enhance contrast different tissues unfixed frozen sections also used studies requiring enzyme localization tissues cells necessary tissue certain procedures antibody linked immunofluorescence staining frozen sectioning also used determine tumour malignant found incidentally surgery patient

stainingedit
main article staining




example staining light microscopy carmine staining monogenean parasitic worm


biological tissue little inherent contrast either light electron microscope staining employed give contrast tissue well highlighting particular features interest underlying mechanistic chemistry staining understood term histochemistry used hematoxylin eosin stain commonly used light microscopical stain histology histopathology hematoxylin basic stains nuclei blue affinity nucleic acids cell nucleus eosin acidic stains cytoplasm pink uranyl acetate lead citrate commonly used impart contrast tissue electron microscope
many staining techniques used selectively stain cells cellular components techniques involves marking peripheral tumors surgical margins certain color applied posterior border sample another anterior identify location tumor pathology within specimen compounds used color tissue sections include safranin congo fast green silver salts numerous natural artificial dyes usually originated development dyes textile industry
histochemistry refers science using chemical reactions laboratory chemicals components within tissue commonly performed histochemical technique perls prussian blue reaction used demonstrate iron deposits diseases like hemochromatosis
histology samples often examined radioactive techniques historadiography slide sometimes stained histochemically xrayed commonly autoradiography used visualize locations radioactive substance transported within body cells phase undergoing replication incorporate tritiated thymidine sites radiolabeled nucleic acid probes bind situ hybridization autoradiography microscopic level slide typically dipped liquid nuclear tract emulsion dries form exposure film individual silver grains film visualized dark field microscopy
recently antibodies used specifically visualize proteins carbohydrates lipids process called immunohistochemistry stain fluorescent molecule immunofluorescence technique greatly increased ability identify categories cells microscope advanced techniques nonradioactive situ hybridization combined immunochemistry identify specific molecules fluorescent probes tags used immunofluorescence enzymelinked fluorescence amplification especially alkaline phosphatase tyramide signal amplification fluorescence microscopy confocal microscopy used detect fluorescent signals good intracellular detail digital cameras increasingly used capture histological histopathological image
