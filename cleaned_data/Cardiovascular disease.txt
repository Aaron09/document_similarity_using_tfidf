important risk factor developing cardiovascular heart diseases approximately tripling risk decade life23 coronary fatty streaks begin form adolescence24 estimated percent people coronary heart disease older25 time risk stroke doubles every decade 5526
multiple explanations proposed explain increases risk cardiovascularheart diseases related serum cholesterol level27 populations serum total cholesterol level increases increases increase levels around years women increase continues sharply years27
aging also associated changes mechanical structural properties vascular wall leads loss arterial elasticity reduced arterial compliance subsequently lead coronary artery disease28

greater risk heart disease premenopausal women2329 past menopause argued womans risk similar mans29 although recent data disputes this23 female diabetes likely develop heart disease male diabetes30
coronary heart diseases times common among middleaged women27 study done world health organization contributes approximately variation ratios coronary heart disease mortality31 another study reports similar results finding gender differences explains nearly half risk associated cardiovascular diseases27 proposed explanations gender differences cardiovascular diseases hormonal difference27 among women estrogen predominant hormone estrogen protective effects glucose metabolism hemostatic system direct effect improving endothelial cell function27 production estrogen decreases menopause change female lipid metabolism toward atherogenic form decreasing cholesterol level increasing total cholesterol levels27
among women notable differences body weight height body distribution heart rate stroke volume arterial compliance28 elderly agerelated large artery pulsatility stiffness pronounced among women men28 caused womens smaller body size arterial dimensions independent menopause28
tobacco
cigarettes major form smoked tobacco2 risks health tobacco result direct consumption tobacco also exposure secondhand smoke2 approximately cardiovascular disease attributed smoking2 however people quit smoking almost risk death never smokers32
physical inactivity
insufficient physical activity defined less minutes moderate activity week less minutes vigorous activity week currently fourth leading risk factor mortality worldwide2 2008 adults aged older women insufficiently physically active2 risk ischemic heart disease diabetes mellitus reduced almost third adults participate minutes moderate physical activity week equivalent33 addition physical activity assists weight loss improves blood glucose control blood pressure lipid profile insulin sensitivity effects least part explain cardiovascular benefits2
diet
high dietary intakes saturated transfats salt intake fruits vegetables fish linked cardiovascular risk although whether associations cause disputed world health organization attributes approximately million deaths worldwide fruit vegetable consumption2 amount dietary salt consumed also important determinant blood pressure levels overall cardiovascular risk2 frequent consumption highenergy foods processed foods high fats sugars promotes obesity increase cardiovascular risk2 cochrane review found replacing saturated polyunsaturated plant based oils reduced cardiovascular disease risk cutting saturated reduced risk cardiovascular disease including heart disease stroke34 high transfat intake adverse effects blood lipids circulating inflammatory markers35 elimination transfat diets widely advocated36 evidence higher consumption sugar associated higher blood pressure unfavorable blood lipids37 sugar intake also increases risk diabetes mellitus38 high consumption processed meats associated increased risk cardiovascular disease possibly part increased dietary salt intake39
relationship alcohol consumption cardiovascular disease complex depend amount alcohol consumed direct relationship high levels alcohol consumption risk cardiovascular disease2 drinking levels without episodes heavy drinking associated reduced risk cardiovascular disease40 overall alcohol consumption population level associated multiple health risks exceed potential benefits241
socioeconomic disadvantage
cardiovascular disease affects middleincome countries even highincome countries42 relatively little information regarding social patterns cardiovascular disease within middleincome countries42 within highincome countries income educational status consistently associated greater risk cardiovascular disease43 policies resulted increased socioeconomic inequalities associated greater subsequent socioeconomic differences cardiovascular disease42 implying cause effect relationship psychosocial factors environmental exposures health behaviours healthcare access quality contribute socioeconomic differentials cardiovascular disease commission social determinants health recommended equal distributions power wealth education housing environmental factors nutrition health care needed address inequalities cardiovascular disease noncommunicable diseases45
pollution
particulate matter studied short longterm exposure effects cardiovascular disease currently pm25 major focus gradients used determine risk every μgm3 pm25 longterm exposure estimated 8–18 mortality risk46 women higher relative risk pm25 induced coronary artery disease did46 overall longterm exposure increased rate atherosclerosis inflammation regards shortterm exposure hours every μgm3 pm25 resulted increase mortality risk47 addition days exposure rise systolic mmhg diastolic mmhg blood pressure occurred every μgm3 pm2547 research implicated pm25 irregular heart rhythm reduced heart rate variability decreased vagal tone notably heart failure4748 pm25 also linked carotid artery thickening increased risk acute myocardial infarction4748
cardiovascular risk assessment
existing cardiovascular disease previous cardiovascular event heart attack stroke strongest predictor future cardiovascular event49 smoking blood pressure blood lipids diabetes important predictors future cardiovascular disease people known cardiovascular disease50 measures sometimes others combined composite risk scores estimate individuals future risk cardiovascular disease49 numerous risk scores exist although respective merits debated51 diagnostic tests biomarkers remain evaluation currently lack clearcut evidence support routine include family history coronary artery calcification score high sensitivity creactive protein hscrp ankle–brachial pressure index lipoprotein subclasses particle concentration lipoproteina apolipoproteins fibrinogen white blood cell count homocysteine nterminal btype natriuretic peptide ntprobnp markers kidney function5253 high blood phosphorus also linked increased risk54
occupational exposure
main article occupational cardiovascular disease
little known relationship work cardiovascular disease links established certain toxins extreme heat cold exposure tobacco smoke mental health concerns stress depression55
chemical risk factors
2015 sbureport looking nonchemical factors found association those56

mentally stressful work lack control working situation effortreward imbalance56
experience social support work experience injustice experience insufficient opportunities personal development experience insecurity56
work night schedules long working weeks56
exposed noise56

specifically risk stroke also increased exposure ionizing radiation56 hypertension develops often experience strain shiftwork56 differences women risk small however risk suffering dying heart attacks stroke twice often women working life56
nonchemical risk factors
2017 report found evidence workplace exposure silica dust engine exhaust welding fumes associated heart disease57 associations also exist exposure arsenic benzopyrenes lead dynamite carbon disulphide carbon monoxide metalworking fluids occupational exposure tobacco smoke57 working electrolytic production aluminium production paper sulphate pulping process used associated heart disease57 association also found heart disease exposure compounds longer permitted certain work environments phenoxy acids containing tcdddioxin asbestos57

screening selection primary prevention interventions traditionally done absolute risk using variety scores framingham reynolds risk scores73 stratification separated people receive lifestyle interventions generally lower intermediate risk medication higher risk number variety risk scores available multiplied efficacy according 2016 review unclear lack external validation impact analysis74 risk stratification models often lack sensitivity population groups account large number negative events among intermediate risk groups73 result future preventative screening appears shift toward applying prevention according randomized trial results intervention rather largescale risk assessment
prevention
cardiovascular disease preventable established risk factors avoided7576 currently practiced measures prevent cardiovascular disease include

tobacco cessation avoidance secondhand smoke77 smoking cessation reduces risk 3578
lowfat lowsugar highfiber diet including whole grains fruit vegetables777980 dietary interventions effective reducing cardiovascular risk factors year longer term effects interventions impact cardiovascular disease events uncertain81
least minutes hours minutes moderate exercise week8283 exercisebased cardiac rehabilitation reduces risk subsequent cardiovascular events 2684 high quality studies benefits exercise training people increased cardiovascular risk history cardiovascular disease85
limit alcohol consumption recommended daily limits77 people moderately consume alcoholic drinks 25–30 lower risk cardiovascular disease8687 however people genetically predisposed consume less alcohol lower rates cardiovascular disease88 suggesting alcohol protective excessive alcohol intake increases risk cardiovascular disease8987 consumption alcohol associated increased risk cardiovascular event following consumption87
lower blood pressure elevated mmhg reduction blood pressure reduces risk 2090

guidelines recommend combining preventive strategies 2015 cochrane review found evidence interventions aiming reduce cardiovascular risk factor favourable effects blood pressure body mass index waist circumference however evidence limited authors unable draw firm conclusions effects cardiovascular events mortality104 adults without known diagnosis hypertension diabetes hyperlipidemia cardiovascular disease routine counseling advise improve diet increase physical activity found significantly alter behavior thus recommended105 another cochrane review suggested simply providing people cardiovascular disease risk score reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors small amount compared usual care106 however uncertainty whether providing scores effect cardiovascular disease events unclear whether dental care periodontitis affects risk cardiovascular disease107
diet
also saturated cardiovascular disease salt cardiovascular disease
diet high fruits vegetables decreases risk cardiovascular disease death108 evidence suggests mediterranean diet improve cardiovascular outcomes109 also evidence mediterranean diet effective lowfat diet bringing longterm changes cardiovascular risk factors lower cholesterol level blood pressure110 dash diet high nuts fish fruits vegetables sweets meat shown reduce blood pressure111 lower total density lipoprotein cholesterol112 improve metabolic syndrome113 longterm benefits outside context clinical trial questioned114 high fiber diet appears lower risk115
total intake appear important risk factor116117 diet high trans fatty acids however increase rates cardiovascular disease117118 worldwide dietary guidelines recommend reduction saturated fat119 however questions around effect saturated cardiovascular disease medical literature118120 reviews 2014 2015 find evidence harm saturated fats118120 2012 cochrane review found suggestive evidence small benefit replacing dietary saturated unsaturated fat121 2013 meta analysis concludes substitution omega linoleic acid type unsaturated increase cardiovascular risk119 replacement saturated fats carbohydrates change increase risk122123 benefits replacement polyunsaturated appears greatest117124 however supplementation omega3 fatty acids type polysaturated appear effect125
2014 cochrane review found unclear benefit recommending lowsalt diet people high normal blood pressure126 heart failure study left rest trials show trend benefit127128 another review dietary salt concluded strong evidence high dietary salt intake increases blood pressure worsens hypertension increases number cardiovascular disease events result increased blood pressure quite likely mechanisms129130 moderate evidence found high salt intake increases cardiovascular mortality evidence found increase overall mortality strokes left ventricular hypertrophy129
medication
blood pressure medication reduces cardiovascular disease people risk90 irrespective age131 baseline level cardiovascular risk132 baseline blood pressure133 commonlyused drug regimens similar efficacy reducing risk major cardiovascular events although differences drugs ability prevent specific outcomes134 larger reductions blood pressure produce larger reductions risk134 people high blood pressure require drug achieve adequate reduction blood pressure135
statins effective preventing cardiovascular disease people history cardiovascular disease136 event rate higher women decrease events easily seen women136 risk without history cardiovascular disease primary prevention statins decrease risk death combined fatal nonfatal cardiovascular disease137 united states guideline recommends statins greater risk cardiovascular disease next years138 niacin fibrates cetp inhibitors increase cholesterol affect risk cardiovascular disease already statins139
antidiabetic medication reduce cardiovascular risk people type diabetes although evidence conclusive140 metaanalysis 2009 including 27049 participants 2370 major vascular events showed relative risk reduction cardiovascular disease moreintensive glucose lowering average followup period years increased risk major hypoglycemia141
aspirin found modest benefit risk heart disease risk serious bleeding almost equal benefit respect cardiovascular problems142 risk recommended143 united states preventive services task force recommends aspirin prevention women less less years however older recommends individuals144
vasoactive agents people pulmonary hypertension left heart disease hypoxemic lung diseases cause harm unnecessary expense145
physical activity
systematic review estimated inactivity responsible burden disease coronary heart disease worldwide146 authors estimated 121000 deaths coronary heart disease could averted europe 2008 physical inactivity removed cochrane review found evidence yoga favourable effects blood pressure cholesterol studies included review quality147
dietary supplements
healthy diet beneficial effect antioxidant supplementation vitamin vitamin vitamins shown protect cardiovascular disease cases possibly result harm148149 mineral supplements also found useful150 niacin type vitamin exception modest decrease risk cardiovascular events high risk151152 magnesium supplementation lowers high blood pressure dose dependent manner153 magnesium therapy recommended people ventricular arrhythmia associated torsades pointes present long syndrome well treatment people digoxin intoxicationinduced arrhythmias154 evidence support omega3 fatty acid supplementation155
management
cardiovascular disease treatable initial treatment primarily focused diet lifestyle interventions2 influenza make heart attacks strokes likely therefore influenza vaccination decrease chance cardiovascular events death people heart disease156
proper management necessitates focus stroke cases combined high mortality rate keeping mind costeffectiveness intervention especially developing countries middle income levels73 regarding strategies using aspirin atenolol streptokinase tissue plasminogen activator compared qualityadjusted lifeyear qaly regions middle income costs single qaly aspirin atenolol streptokinase 630–730 16000 respectively aspirin inhibitors beta blockers statins used together secondary prevention regions showed single qaly costs 300–400
