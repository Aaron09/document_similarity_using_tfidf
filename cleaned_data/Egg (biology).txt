common reproductive strategy fish known oviparity female lays undeveloped eggs externally fertilized male typically large numbers eggs laid time adult female produce million eggs spawning eggs left develop without parental care larvae hatch often carry remains yolk yolk continues nourish larvae days learn swim yolk consumed critical point must learn hunt feed
fish notably rays sharks ovoviviparity eggs fertilized develop internally however larvae still grow inside consuming eggs yolk without direct nourishment mother mother gives birth relatively mature young certain instances physically developed offspring devour smaller siblings nutrition still within mothers body known intrauterine cannibalism
certain scenarios fish hammerhead shark reef shark viviparous fertilized developed internally mother also providing direct nourishment
eggs fish amphibians jellylike cartilagenous fish sharks skates rays chimaeras eggs fertilized internally exhibit wide variety internal external embryonic development fish species spawn eggs fertilized externally typically male inseminating eggs female lays eggs shell would even airbreathing amphibians eggs water protective foam coast foamnest treefrog chiromantis xerampelina
bird eggs
main article bird
bird eggs laid females incubated time varies according species single young hatches average clutch sizes range condors grey partridge birds eggs even fertilized hens uncommon owners find lone bird nesting clutch unfertilized eggs sometimes called windeggs
colors




guillemot eggs


default color vertebrate eggs white calcium carbonate shells made birds mainly passerines produce colored eggs pigment biliverdin zinc chelate give green blue ground color protoporphyrin produces reds browns ground color spotting
nonpasserines typically white eggs except groundnesting groups charadriiformes sandgrouse nightjars camouflage necessary parasitic cuckoos match passerine hosts passerines contrast colored eggs even need cryptic colors
however suggested protoporphyrin markings passerine eggs actually reduce brittleness acting solid state lubricant10 insufficient calcium available local soil shell thin especially circle around broad protoporphyrin speckling compensates increases inversely amount calcium soil11
reason later eggs clutch spotted early ones females store calcium depleted
color individual eggs also genetically influenced appears inherited mother suggesting gene responsible pigmentation determining chromosome female birds males
used thought color applied shell immediately laying research shows coloration integral part development shell protein responsible depositing calcium carbonate protoporphyrins lack mineral
species common guillemot nest large groups females eggs different markings making easier females identify eggs crowded cliff ledges breed
shell
bird eggshells diverse example

cormorant eggs rough chalky
tinamou eggs shiny
duck eggs oily waterproof
cassowary eggs heavily pitted

tiny pores bird eggshells allow embryo breathe domestic hens around 7000 pores12
shape
bird eggs oval shape rounded pointed shape results forced oviduct muscles contract oviduct behind pushing forward eggs wall still shapeable pointed develops back long pointy eggs incidental consequence streamlined body typical birds strong flying abilities flight narrows oviduct changes type bird lay13 cliffnesting birds often highly conical eggs less likely roll tending instead roll around tight circle trait likely arisen evolution natural selection contrast many holenesting birds nearly spherical eggs
predation
many animals feed eggs example principal predators black oystercatchers eggs include raccoons skunks mink river otters gulls crows foxes stoat mustela erminea longtailed weasel frenata steal ducks eggs snakes genera dasypeltis elachistodon specialize eating eggs
brood parasitism occurs birds species lays eggs nest another cases hosts eggs removed eaten female expelled chick brood parasites include cowbirds many world cuckoos

amniote eggs embryos




turtle eggs nest female common snapping turtle chelydra serpentina


like amphibians amniotes airbreathing vertebrates complex eggs embryos including amniotic membrane amniotes include reptiles including dinosaurs descendants birds mammals
reptile eggs often rubbery always initially white able survive often developing embryo determined temperature surroundings cooler temperatures favouring males reptiles eggs viviparous live birth
dinosaurs laid eggs preserved petrified fossils
among mammals early extinct species laid eggs platypuses echidnas spiny anteaters platypuses genera echidna australian monotremes marsupial placental mammals eggs unborn young complex tissues identify amniotes
mammalian eggs
eggs egglaying mammals platypus echidnas macrolecithal eggs much like reptiles eggs marsupials likewise macrolecithal rather small develop inside body female form placenta young born early stage classified larva biological sense14
placental mammals void yolk develops umbilical cord structures reptiles would form yolk receiving nutrients mother fetus completes development inside uterus
invertebrate eggs




nudibranch orangepeel doris acanthodoris lutea tide pool laying eggs


eggs common among invertebrates including insects spiders mollusks crustaceans
evolution structure
sexually reproducing life including plants animals produces gametes male gamete cell sperm usually motile whereas female gamete cell ovum generally larger sessile male female gametes combine produce zygote cell multicellular organisms zygote subsequently divides organised manner smaller specialised cells individual develops embryo animals embryo sessile initial stage individual life cycle followed emergence hatching motile stage zygote ovum sessile organic vessel containing developing embryo called
recent proposal suggests phylotypic animal body plans originated cell aggregates existence stage development eggs view later evolutionary innovations selected role ensuring genetic uniformity among cells incipient multicellular organisms15
scientific classifications
scientists often classify animal reproduction according degree development occurs individuals expelled adult body yolk provides nourish embryo
size yolk
vertebrate eggs classified relative amount yolk simple eggs little yolk called microlecithal mediumsized eggs yolk called mesolecithal large eggs large concentrated yolk called macrolecithal7 classification eggs based eggs chordates though basic principle extends whole animal kingdom
microlecithal




microlecithal eggs roundworm toxocara






microlecithal eggs flatworm paragonimus westermani


small eggs little yolk called microlecithal yolk evenly distributed cleavage cell cuts divides cells fairly similar sizes sponges cnidarians dividing eggs develop directly simple larva rather like morula cilia cnidarians stage called planula either develops directly adult animals forms adult individuals process budding16
microlecithal eggs require minimal yolk mass eggs found flatworms roundworms annelids bivalves echinoderms lancelet marine arthropods17 anatomically simple animals cnidarians flatworms fetal development quite short even microlecithal eggs undergo direct development small eggs produced large numbers animals high mortality microlecithal eggs norm bivalves marine arthropods however latter complex anatomically flatworms small microlecithal eggs allow full development instead eggs hatch larvae markedly different adult animal
placental mammals embryo nourished mother throughout whole fetal period reduced size essentially naked cell
mesolecithal




frogspawn mesolecithal


mesolecithal eggs comparatively yolk microlecithal eggs yolk concentrated part vegetal pole cell nucleus cytoplasm animal pole cell cleavage uneven mainly concentrated cytoplasmarich animal pole3
larger yolk content mesolecithal eggs allows longer fetal development comparatively anatomically simple animals able full development leave form reminiscent adult animal situation found hagfish snails417 animals smaller size eggs advanced anatomy still distinct larval stage though larva basically similar adult animal lampreys coelacanth salamanders3
macrolecithal




baby tortoise begins emerge fully developed macrolecithal


eggs large yolk called macrolecithal eggs usually number embryos enough food full fetal development groups7 macrolecithal eggs found selected representatives groups cephalopods vertebrates718
macrolecithal eggs different type development eggs large size yolk cell division split yolk mass fetus instead develops platelike structure yolk mass envelopes later stage7 portion yolk mass still present external semiexternal yolk hatching many groups form fetal development common bony fish even though eggs quite small despite macrolecithal structure small size eggs allow direct development eggs hatch larval stage terrestrial animals macrolecithal eggs large volume surface ratio necessitates structures transport oxygen carbon dioxide storage waste products embryo suffocate poisoned waste inside amniote9
addition bony fish cephalopods macrolecithal eggs found cartilaginous fish reptiles birds monotreme mammals3 eggs coelacanths reach size diameter young full development uterus living copious yolk19
egglaying reproduction
animals commonly classified manner reproduction general level distinguishing egglaying latin oviparous livebearing latin viviparous
classifications divided detail according development occurs offspring expelled adults body traditionally20

ovuliparity means female spawns unfertilized eggs must externally fertilised ovuliparity typical bony fish anurans echinoderms bivalves cnidarians aquatic organisms ovuliparous term derived diminiutive meaning little
oviparity fertilisation occurs internally eggs laid female zygotes newly developing embryos often important outer tissues added example chicken part outside yolk originates zygote oviparity typical birds reptiles cartilaginous fish arthropods terrestrial organisms typically oviparous eggcasings resist evaporation moisture
ovoviviparity zygote retained adult’s body trophic feeding interactions embryo still obtains nutrients inside livebearing fish amphibians reptiles actually ovoviviparous examples include reptile anguis fragilis horse zygotes retained male’s ventral marsupium frogs rhinoderma darwinii eggs develop vocal rheobatrachus eggs develop stomach
histotrophic viviparity means embryos develop female’s oviducts obtain nutrients consuming zygotes sibling embryos oophagy adelphophagy intrauterine cannibalism occurs sharks black salamander salamandra atra marsupials excrete uterine milk supplementing nourishment yolk sak21
hemotrophic viviparity nutrients provided females blood designated organ commonly occurs placenta found mammals similar structures found sharks lizard pseudomoia pagenstecheri2223 hylid frogs embryo mother specialized gills24

term hemotropic derives latin bloodfeeding contrasted histotrophic tissuefeeding25
