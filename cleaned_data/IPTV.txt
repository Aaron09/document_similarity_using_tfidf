hybrid iptvedit






sections factual accuracy compromised outofdate information please update article reflect recent events newly available information july 2011



hybrid iptv refers combination traditional broadcast services video delivered either managed networks public internet increasing trend consumer operator markets525354
hybrid iptv grown popularity recent yearswhen result major drivers since emergence online video aggregation sites like youtube vimeo mid2000s traditional operators come increasing pressure provide subscribers means viewing internetbased video professional usergenerated televisions time specialist ipbased operators often telecommunications providers looked ways offer analogue digital terrestrial services operations without adding either additional cost complexity transmission operations bandwidth valuable asset operators many looked alternative ways deliver services without investing additional network infrastructures
hybrid settop allows content range sources including terrestrial broadcast satellite cable brought together video delivered internet ethernet connection device enables television viewers access greater variety content sets without need separate service
hybrid iptv settop boxes also enable users access range advanced interactive services catchup well internet applications including video telephony surveillance gaming shopping egovernment accessed television
paytv operator’s perspective hybrid iptv settop gives greater longterm flexibility enabling deploy services applications consumers require often without need upgrade equipment technician visit reconfigure swap device reduces cost launching services increases speed market limits disruption consumers55
hybrid broadcast broadband hbbtv consortium industry companies currentlywhen promoting establishing open european standard hybrid settop boxes reception broadcast broadband digital multimedia applications single user interface56 trends development hybrid broadcast broadband settop boxes included broadcast tuner internet connection usually ethernet port first commercially available hybrid iptv settop developed advanced digital broadcast developer digital television hardware software 2005 platform developed spanish operator telefonica57 used part movistar service launched subscribers 2005
alternative approach iptv version headend cable solution multiple channels distributed satellite iptv provider’s point presence ipencapsulated distribution individual subscribers required subscriber
provide huge selection channels subscribers without overburdening internet trunking enables iptv service offered small remote operators outside reach terrestrial high speed broadband connection example network combining fibre satellite distribution skies satellite channels latin america caribbean operated iptv americas58
future development iptv probably lies number coexisting architectures implementations clearaccording broadcasting high bandwidth applications iptv accomplished efficiently costeffectively using satellite59 predicted majority global iptv growth fuelled hybrid networks60
advantagesedit
internet protocolbased platform offers significant advantages including ability integrate television ipbased services like high speed internet access voip
switched network also allows delivery significantly content functionality typical satellite network using broadcast video technology content constantly flows downstream customer customer switches content settop customer select many choices telecomms cable satellite company stuff “pipe” flowing home switched network works differently content remains network content customer selects sent customer’s home frees bandwidth customer’s choice less restricted size “pipe” home also implies customers privacy could compromised greater extent possible traditional satellite networks also provide means hack least disrupt denial service private network
economicsedit
cable industrys expenditures approximately billion year based network updates accommodate higher data speeds operators channels support maximum data speeds mbits mbits however video streams require high rate much longer periods time expenditures support high amounts video traffic much greater phenomenon called persistency data persistency routinely video persistency easily reach video traffic continues grow means significantly cmts downstream channels required carry video content based todays market likely industry expenditures cmts expansion could exceed billion year virtually expenditure driven video traffic adoption iptv carrying majority traffic could save industry approximately capital expenditure61
interactivityedit
ipbased platform also allows significant opportunities make viewing experience interactive personalised supplier example include interactive programme guide allows viewers search content title actor’s name pictureinpicture functionality allows “channel surf” without leaving programme they’re watching viewers able look player’s stats watching sports game control camera angle also able access photos music television wireless phone schedule recording favourite show even adjust parental controls child watch documentary school report they’re away home
order take place interaction receiver transmitter feedback channel needed terrestrial satellite cable networks television allow interactivity however interactivity networks possible combining networks data networks internet mobile communication network
videoondemandedit
iptv technology bringing video demand television62 permits customer browse online programme film catalogue watch trailers select selected recording playout selected item starts nearly instantaneously customers
technically customer selects movie pointtopoint unicast connection customers decoder settop delivering streaming server signalling trick play functionality pause slowmotion windrewind assured rtsp real time streaming protocol
common codecs used mpeg2 mpeg4
attempt avoid content piracy content usually encrypted whilst encryption satellite cable broadcasts practice iptv technology effectively thought form digital rights management film chosen example playable hours following payment time becomes unavailable
iptvbased converged servicesedit
another advantage opportunity integration convergence opportunity amplified using imsbased solutions63 converged services implies interaction existing services seamless manner create value added services example onscreen caller getting caller ability handle send voice mail ipbased services help enable efforts provide consumers anytimeanywhere access content televisions cell phones integrate services content together within businesses institutions iptv eliminates need parallel infrastructure deliver live stored video services
limitationsedit
iptv sensitive packet loss delays streamed data unreliable iptv strict minimum speed requirements order facilitate right number frames second deliver moving pictures means limited connection speed bandwidth available large iptv customer base reduce service quality delivered
although countries highspeed broadbandenabled populations south korea million homes benefiting minimum connection speed mbits countries legacy networks struggle provide mbits64needs update simultaneous provision home channels voip internet access viable lastmile delivery iptv usually bandwidth restriction allows small number simultaneous channel streams typically three delivered65
streaming iptv across wireless links within home proved troublesome bandwidth limitations manywho assume issues multipath reflections signal carrying data packets iptv stream sensitive packets arriving right time right order improvements wireless technology nowwhen starting provide equipment solve problem66
limitations wireless iptv service providers today wired home networking technologies instead wireless technologies like ieee 80211 service providers makes extensive wireline home networking part uverse iptv service expressed support work done direction itut adopted recommendation also known g9960 nextgeneration home networking standard specifies common phymac operate home wiring power lines phone lines coaxial cables6768
latencyedit
latency inherent satellite internet often held reason satellites cannot successfully used iptv practice however latency important factor iptv since service require realtime transmission case telephony videoconferencing services
latency response requests change channel display affects customers’ perceived quality service problems affect satellite iptv terrestrial iptv command latency problems faced terrestrial iptv networks insufficient bandwidth customer base grows solved high capacity satellite distribution
satellite distribution suffer latency time signal travel satellite back user around seconds cannot reduced however effects delay mitigated reallife systems using data compression tcpacceleration http prefetching69
satellite latency detrimental especially timesensitive applications online gaming although seriously affects likes firstperson shooters many mmogs operate well satellite internet70 iptv typically simplex operation oneway transmission latency critical factor video transmission
existing video transmission systems analogue digital formats already introduce known quantifiable delays existing channels simulcast terrestrial satellite transmissions experience 025second delay difference services detrimental effect goes unnoticed viewers
