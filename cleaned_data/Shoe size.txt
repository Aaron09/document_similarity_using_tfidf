size shoe considered suitable small interval foot lengths inner cavity shoe must typically 15–20 longer foot varies different types shoes
shoesize system refer three characteristic lengths

median length feet shoe suitable customers measure advantage directly related body measures applies equally type form material shoe however measure less popular manufacturerscitation needed requires test carefully shoe model range foot sizes recommendable puts manufacturer burden ensuring shoe foot given length
length inner cavity shoe measure advantage measured easily finished product however vary manufacturing tolerances gives customer crude information range foot sizes shoe suitable
length last footshaped template shoe manufactured measure easiest manufacturer identifies tool used produce shoe makes promise manufacturing tolerances size foot shoe actually suitable leaves responsibility risk choosing correct size customer last measured several different ways resulting different measurements1

difficulties shoe size comparisonedit
please note following tables indicate theoretical sizes calculated standards information given differences various shoe size tables makers tables tables found usually following factors

systems fully standardised differences shoes different makers different methods measuring shoes different manufacturing processes different allowances1 sometimes related different countries german size differ french size although countries continental european system
different widths result wide feet shoe multiple sizes larger actually long required also result different size indications especially different typical widths attributed different sizing systems countries
tables children take future growth account shoe size larger would correspond actual length foot7
indication centimetres inches mean length foot length shoes inner cavity relation constant varies different amounts wiggle room required different sizes shoes
several systems differ substantially sizes medium sizes

tables available simply contain errors example wiggle room different zero point taken account tables based different systems traditional athletic simply combined although incompatible
