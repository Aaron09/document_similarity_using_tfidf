overviewedit
rmodp reference model based precise concepts derived current distributed processing developments possible formal description techniques specification architecture many rmodp concepts possibly different names around long time rigorously described explained exact philosophy example works mario bunge systems thinking example works friedrich hayek concepts—such abstraction composition emergence—have recently provided solid mathematical foundation category theory
rmodp four fundamental elements

object modelling approach system specification
specification system terms separate interrelated viewpoint specifications
definition system infrastructure providing distribution transparencies system applications
framework assessing system conformance

rmodp family recommendations international standards defines system interrelated essential concepts necessary specify open distributed processing systems provides welldeveloped enterprise architecture framework structuring specifications largescale systems including software systems

overview6 contains motivational overview giving scoping justification explanation concepts outline architecture contains explanatory material rmodp interpreted applied users include standard writers architects systems

viewpoints modeling rmodp frameworkedit
complex system specifications extensive single individual fully comprehend aspects specifications furthermore different interests given system different reasons examining systems specifications business executive different questions system makeup would system implementer concept rmodp viewpoints framework therefore provide separate viewpoints specification given complex system viewpoints satisfy audience interest particular aspects system associated viewpoint viewpoint language optimizes vocabulary presentation audience viewpoint
viewpoint modeling become effective approach dealing inherent complexity large distributed systems current software architectural practices described ieee 1471 divide design activity several areas concerns focusing specific aspect system examples include view model zachman framework togaf dodaf course rmodp
viewpoint subdivision specification complete system established bring together particular pieces information relevant particular area concern analysis design system although separately specified viewpoints completely independent items identified related items viewpoints moreover viewpoint substantially uses foundational concepts defined part rmodp however viewpoints sufficiently independent simplify reasoning complete specification mutual consistency among viewpoints ensured architecture defined rmodp common object model provides glue binds together
specifically rmodp framework provides five generic complementary viewpoints system environment

enterprise viewpoint focuses purpose scope policies system describes business requirements meet
information viewpoint focuses semantics information information processing performed describes information managed system structure content type supporting data
computational viewpoint enables distribution functional decomposition system objects interact interfaces describes functionality provided system functional decomposition
engineering viewpoint focuses mechanisms functions required support distributed interactions objects system describes distribution processing performed system manage information provide functionality
technology viewpoint focuses choice technology system describes technologies chosen provide processing functionality presentation information

rmodp umledit
currently growing interest system modellingcitation needed however widely agreed approach structuring specifications adds cost adopting system specification hampers communication system developers makes difficult relate merge system specifications need integrate systems
although reference model provides abstract languages relevant concepts prescribe particular notations used individual viewpoints viewpoint languages defined reference model abstract languages sense define concepts used represented lack precise notations expressing different models involved multiviewpoint specification system common feature enterprise architectural approaches including zachman framework model rmodp approaches consciously defined notation representationneutral manner increase flexibility however makes difficult among things development industrial tools modeling viewpoint specifications formal analysis specifications produced possible derivation implementations system specifications
