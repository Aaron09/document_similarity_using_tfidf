history
also history television
video technology first developed mechanical television systems quickly replaced cathode tube television systems several technologies video display devices since invented video originally exclusively live technology charles ginsburg ampex research team developing first practical video tape recorder 1951 first video tape recorder captured live images television cameras converting cameras electrical impulses saving information onto magnetic video tape
video recorders sold 50000 1956 videotapes cost onehour reel2 however prices gradually dropped years 1971 sony began selling videocassette recorder decks tapes consumer market3
digital techniques video created digital video allows higher quality eventually much lower cost earlier analog technology invention 1997 bluray disc 2006 sales videotape recording equipment plummeted advances computer technology allows even inexpensive personal computers smartphones capture store edit transmit digital video reducing cost video production allowing programmakers broadcasters move tapeless production advent digital broadcasting subsequent digital television transition process relegating analog video status legacy technology parts world 2015update increasing highresolution video cameras improved dynamic range color gamuts highdynamicrange digital intermediate data formats improved color depth modern digital video technology converging digital film technology

video quality
video quality measured formal metrics like psnr subjective video quality using expert observation
subjective video quality video processing system evaluated follows

choose video sequences testing
choose settings system evaluate
choose test method present video sequences experts collect ratings
invite sufficient number experts preferably fewer
carry testing
calculate average marks based experts ratings

video compression method digital
main article video compression
uncompressed video delivers maximum quality high data rate variety methods used compress video streams effective ones using group pictures reduce spatial temporal redundancy broadly speaking spatial redundancy reduced registering differences parts single frame task known intraframe compression closely related image compression likewise temporal redundancy reduced registering differences frames task known interframe compression including motion compensation techniques common modern standards mpeg2 used bluray satellite television mpeg4 used avchd mobile phones internet
stereoscopic
stereoscopic video created using several different methods

channels right channel right left channel left channels viewed simultaneously using lightpolarizing filters degrees offaxis video projectors separately polarized channels viewed wearing eyeglasses matching polarization filters
channel overlaid colorcoded layers left right layer technique occasionally used network broadcast recent anaglyph releases movies simple redcyan plastic glasses provide means view images discretely form stereoscopic view content
