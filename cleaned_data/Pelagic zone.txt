pelagic zone consists water column open ocean divided regions depth word pelagic derived greek πέλαγος pélagos meaning open pelagic zone thought terms imaginary cylinder water column goes surface almost bottom conditions differ deeper water column pressure increases depth temperature drops less light penetrates depending depth water column rather like earths atmosphere divided different layers
pelagic zone occupies 1330 million million mean depth maximum depth mi123 fish live pelagic zone called pelagic fish pelagic life decreases increasing depth affected light intensity pressure temperature salinity supply dissolved oxygen nutrients submarine topography called bathymetry deep water pelagic zone sometimes called openocean zone contrasted water near coast continental shelf contexts coastal water near bottom still said pelagic zone

pelagic ecosystemedit




pelagic sooty tern spends months time flying returning land breeding5


pelagic ecosystem based phytoplankton phytoplankton manufacture food using process photosynthesis need sunlight inhabit upper sunlit epipelagic zone includes coastal neritic zone biodiversity diminishes markedly deeper zones epipelagic zone dissolved oxygen diminishes water pressure increases temperatures become colder food sources become scarce light diminishes finally disappears6
pelagic birdsedit
also seabird
pelagic birds also called oceanic birds live open rather around waters adjacent land around inland waters pelagic birds feed planktonic crustaceans squid forage fish examples atlantic puffin macaroni penguins sooty terns shearwaters procellariiformes albatross procellariidae petrels
term seabird includes birds live around adjacent land well pelagic birds
pelagic fishedit

pelagic fish live water column coastal ocean lake waters near bottom lake contrasted demersal fish live near bottom coral reef fish7
fish often migratory forage fish feed plankton larger fish follow feed forage fish examples migratory forage fish herring anchovies capelin menhaden examples larger pelagic fish prey forage fish billfish tuna oceanic sharks
pelagic invertebratesedit
examples pelagic invertebrates include krill copepods jellyfish decapod larvae hyperiid amphipods rotifers cladocerans
thorsons rule states benthic marine invertebrates latitudes tend produce large numbers eggs developing widely dispersing pelagic larvae whereas high latitudes organisms tend produce fewer larger lecithotrophic yolkfeeding eggs larger offspring89
pelagic reptilesedit

many species turtles spend first years lives pelagic zone moving closer shore reach maturity
