physical geography divided several subfields follows

geomorphology field concerned understanding surface earth processes shaped present well past geomorphology field several subfields deal specific landforms various environments desert geomorphology fluvial geomorphology however subfields united core processes cause mainly tectonic climatic processes geomorphology seeks understand landform history dynamics predict future changes combination field observation physical experiment numerical modeling geomorphometry early studies geomorphology foundation pedology main branches soil science





meander formation



hydrology predominantly concerned amounts quality water moving accumulating land surface soils rocks near surface typified hydrological cycle thus field encompasses water rivers lakes aquifers extent glaciers field examines process dynamics involved bodies water hydrology historically important connection engineering thus developed largely quantitative method research however earth science side embraces systems approach similar fields physical geography subfields examine specific bodies water interaction spheres limnology ecohydrology
glaciology study glaciers sheets commonly cryosphere phenomena involve glaciology groups latter sheets continental glaciers former glaciers alpine glaciers although research areas similar research undertaken dynamics sheets glaciers former tends concerned interaction sheets present climate latter impact glaciers landscape glaciology also vast array subfields examining factors processes involved sheets glaciers snow hydrology glacial geology
biogeography science deals geographic patterns species distribution processes result patterns biogeography emerged field study result work alfred russel wallace although field prior late twentieth century largely viewed historic outlook descriptive approach main stimulus field since founding evolution plate tectonics theory island biogeography field largely divided five subfields island biogeography paleobiogeography phylogeography zoogeography phytogeography
climatology study climate scientifically defined weather conditions averaged long period time climatology examines nature micro local macro global climates natural anthropogenic influences field also subdivided largely climates various regions study specific phenomena time periods tropical cyclone rainfall climatology paleoclimatology
meteorology interdisciplinary scientific study atmosphere focuses weather processes short term forecasting contrast climatology studies field stretch back millennia though significant progress meteorology occur eighteenth century meteorological phenomena observable weather events illuminate explained science meteorology
pedology study soils natural environment main branches soil science edaphology pedology mainly deals pedogenesis soil morphology soil classification physical geography pedology largely studied numerous interactions climate water temperature soil life microorganisms plants animals mineral materials within soils biogeochemical cycles position effects landscape lateralization
palaeogeography crossdisciplinary study examines preserved material stratigraphic record determine distribution continents geologic time almost evidence positions continents comes geology form fossils paleomagnetism data resulted evidence continental drift plate tectonics supercontinents turn supported palaeogeographic theories wilson cycle
coastal geography study dynamic interface ocean land incorporating physical geography coastal geomorphology geology oceanography human geography coast involves understanding coastal weathering processes particularly wave action sediment movement weathering also ways humans interact coast coastal geography although predominantly geomorphological research concerned coastal landforms also causes influences level change
oceanography branch physical geography studies earths oceans seas covers wide range topics including marine organisms ecosystem dynamics biological oceanography ocean currents waves geophysical fluid dynamics physical oceanography plate tectonics geology floor geological oceanography fluxes various chemical substances physical properties within ocean across boundaries chemical oceanography diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines oceanographers blend knowledge world ocean understanding processes within
quaternary science interdisciplinary field study focusing quaternary period encompasses last million years field studies last recent interstadial holocene uses proxy evidence reconstruct past environments period infer climatic environmental changes occurred
landscape ecology subdiscipline ecology geography address spatial variation landscape affects ecological processes distribution flow energy materials individuals environment turn influence distribution landscape elements hedgerows field largely founded german geographer carl troll landscape ecology typically deals problems applied holistic context main difference biogeography landscape ecology latter concerned flows energy material changed impacts landscape whereas former concerned spatial patterns species chemical cycles
geomatics field gathering storing processing delivering geographic information spatially referenced information geomatics includes geodesy scientific discipline deals measurement representation earth gravitational field geodynamic phenomena crustal motion oceanic tides polar motion geographical information science remote sensing short largescale acquisition information object phenomenon either recording realtime sensing devices physical intimate contact object
environmental geography branch geography analyzes spatial aspects interactions humans natural world branch bridges divide human physical geography thus requires understanding dynamics geology meteorology hydrology biogeography geomorphology well ways human societies conceptualize environment although branch previously visible research present theories environmental determinism linking society environment largely become domain study environmental management anthropogenic influences
