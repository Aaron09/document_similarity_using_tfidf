ward cunningham inventor wiki


ward cunningham coauthor leuf book wiki quick collaboration described essence wiki concept follows8

wiki invites users—not experts—to edit page create pages within wiki site using standard plainvanilla browser without extra addons
wiki promotes meaningful topic associations different pages making page link creation intuitively easy showing whether intended target page exists
wiki carefully crafted site created experts professional writers designed casual visitors instead seeks involve typical visitoruser ongoing process creation collaboration constantly changes website landscape

wiki enables communities editors contributors write documents collaboratively people require contribute computer internet access browser basic understanding simple markup language html single page wiki website referred wiki page entire collection pages usually wellinterconnected hyperlinks wiki wiki essentially database creating browsing searching information wiki allows nonlinear evolving complex networked text also allowing editor argument debate interaction regarding content formatting9 defining characteristic wiki technology ease pages created updated generally review moderator gatekeeper modifications accepted thus lead changes website many wikis open alteration general public without requiring registration user accounts many edits made realtime appear almost instantly online however feature facilitates abuse system private wiki servers require user authentication edit pages sometimes even read maged kamel boulos cito maramba steve wheeler write open wikis produce process social darwinism unfit sentences sections ruthlessly culled edited replaced considered hopefully results evolution higher quality relevant page openness invite vandalism posting untrue information openness also makes possible rapidly correct restore quality wiki page10

wikis edit button link directly page viewed user permission edit page lead textbased editing page participants structure format wiki pages simplified markup language sometimes known wikitext wiki markup also lead wysiwyg editing page paragraph table example starting lines text asterisks could create bulleted list style syntax wikitexts vary greatly among wiki implementationsexample needed also allow html tags
wikis favoured plaintext editing fewer simpler conventions html indicating style structure although limiting access html cascading style sheets wikis limits user ability alter structure formatting wiki content benefits limited access promotes consistency look feel javascript disabled prevents user implementing code limit users access


mediawiki syntax behind scenes code used formatting text
equivalent html another type behind scenes code used formatting text

take march hare said alice earnestly
nothing alice replied offended tone cant take
mean cant take less said hatter easy take nothing



wikis also make wysiwyg editing available users usually means javascript control translates graphically entered formatting instructions corresponding html tags wikitext implementations markup newly edited markedup version page generated submitted server transparently shielding user technical detail example visualeditor wikipedia however wysiwyg controls always provide features available wikitext users prefer wysiwyg editor hence many sites offer means edit wikitext directly
wikis keep record changes made wiki pages often every version page stored means authors revert older version page necessary mistake made content accidentally deleted page vandalized include offensive malicious text inappropriate content
many wiki implementations mediawiki allow users supply edit summary edit page short piece text summarizing changes made corrected grammar fixed formatting table inserted articles main text stored along revision page allowing users explain done similar message making changes revisioncontrol system enables users changes made often list summaries dates short relevant content list called history
navigation
within text pages usually large number hypertext links pages within wiki form nonlinear navigation native wiki structuredformalized navigation schemes users also create number index tableofcontents pages hierarchical categorization whatever form organization like challenging maintain hand multiple authors users create delete pages unorganized manner wikis provide ways categorize pages support maintenance index pages wikis including original backlink feature displays pages link given page also typically possible wiki create links pages exist invite others share know subject wiki wiki users typically pages categories keywords make easier users find article example user creating article cold weather cycling might page categories commuting winter sports bicycling would make easier users find article
linking creating pages
links created using specific syntax socalled link pattern originally wikiscitation needed used camelcase name pages create links produced capitalizing words phrase removing spaces word camelcase example camelcase makes linking easy also leads links form deviates standard spelling link page singleword title must abnormally capitalize letters word wiki instead wiki camelcasebased wikis instantly recognizable many links names tableofcontents beginnerquestions possible wiki render visible anchor links pretty reinserting spaces possibly also reverting lower case however reprocessing link improve readability anchor limited loss capitalization information caused camelcase reversal example richardwagner rendered richard wagner whereas popularmusic rendered popular music easy determine capital letters remain capitalized result many wikis free linking using brackets disable camelcase default
searching
wikis offer least title search sometimes fulltext search scalability search depends whether wiki engine uses database wikis pmwiki flat files11 mediawikis first versions used flat files rewritten daniel crocker early 2000s decade database application indexed database access necessary high speed searches large wikis alternatively external search engines google search sometimes used wikis limited searching functions order obtain precise results

history comparison reports highlight changes revisions page


wikis generally designed philosophy making easy correct mistakes rather making difficult make thus wikis open provide means verify validity recent additions body pages prominent almost every wiki recent changes page—a specific list numbering recent edits list edits made within given time frame20 wikis filter list remove minor edits edits made automatic importing scripts bots21 change functions accessible wikis revision history shows previous page versions diff feature highlights changes revisions using revision history editor view restore previous version article diff feature used decide whether necessary regular wiki user view diff edit listed recent changes page unacceptable edit consult history restoring previous revision process less streamlined depending wiki software used22
case unacceptable edits missed recent changes page wiki engines provide additional content control monitored ensure page pages keeps quality person willing maintain pages warned modifications pages allowing verify validity editions quickly23 watchlist common implementation wikis also implement patrolled revisions editors requisite credentials mark edits vandalism flagged revisions system prevent edits going live reviewed24
trustworthiness reliability content
critics publicly editable wiki systems argue systems could easily tampered malicious individuals vandals even wellmeaning unskilled users introduce errors content proponents argue community users catch malicious content correct lars aronsson data systems specialist summarizes controversy follows people first learn wiki concept assume site edited anybody would soon rendered useless destructive input sounds like offering free spray cans next grey concrete wall likely outcome would ugly graffiti simple tagging many artistic efforts would long lived still seems work well12 high editorial standards medicine health sciences articles users typically peerreviewed journals university textbooks sources idea expertmoderated wikis25 wikis allow link specific versions articles useful scientific community expert peer reviewers could analyse articles improve provide links trusted version article26 noveck points participants accredited members wiki community vested interest preserving quality work product basis ongoing participation controversial topics subject disruptive editing wiki restrict editing registered users27
security
edit redirects wikipedias policy edit warring wikipediaedit warring
open philosophy wiki allowing anyone edit content ensure every editors intentions wellmannered example vandalism changing wiki content something offensive adding nonsense deliberately adding incorrect information hoax information major problem larger wiki sites wikimedia foundation vandalism unnoticed period time wikis open nature susceptible intentional disruption known trolling wikis tend take softsecurity28unreliable source approach problem vandalism making damage easy undo rather attempting prevent damage larger wikis often employ sophisticated methods bots automatically identify revert vandalism javascript enhancements show characters added edit vandalism limited minor vandalism sneaky vandalism characters addedeliminated bots identify users much attention them29unreliable source example reverts vandalism wikipedia cluebot cluebot revert edits often within minutes seconds uses machine learning lieu heuristics30
amount vandalism wiki receives depends open wiki instance wikis allow unregistered users identified addresses edit content others limit function registered users wikis allow anonymous editing without account31 give registered users additional editing functions wikis becoming registered user short simple process wikis require additional waiting period gaining access certain tools example english wikipedia registered users rename pages account least four days made least edits wikis portuguese wikipedia editing requirement instead time requirement granting extra tools user made certain number edits prove trustworthiness usefulness editor vandalism wikipedia common though policed usually reverted extremely open allowing anyone computer internet access edit although makes grow rapidly contrast citizendium requires editors real name short autobiography affecting growth wiki sometimes helping stop vandalism
edit wars also occur users repetitively revert page version favor cases editors opposing views content appear formatting style used change rechange others edits results page unstable general users perspective time general user comes page look different wiki software allows administrator stop edit wars locking page editing decision made version page would appropriate9 wikis better position others control behavior governance structures existing outside wiki instance college teacher create incentives students behave class wiki administer limiting editing loggedin users pointing contributions traced back contributors behavior dealt accordance university policies11 issue wiki vandalism debated cases editor deletes entire article replaces nonsense content test edit made user experimenting wiki system editors realize damaged page realize know undo mistake restore content
