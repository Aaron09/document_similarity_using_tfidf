technical overviewedit




beginning http scheme domain name label


http functions request–response protocol client–server computing model browser example client application running computer hosting website server client submits http request message server server provides resources html files content performs functions behalf client returns response message client response contains completion status information request also contain requested content message body
browser example user agent types user agent include indexing software used search providers crawlers voice browsers mobile apps software accesses consumes displays content
http designed permit intermediate network elements improve enable communications clients servers hightraffic websites often benefit cache servers deliver content behalf upstream servers improve response time browsers cache previously accessed resources reuse possible reduce network traffic http proxy servers private network boundaries facilitate communication clients without globally routable address relaying messages external servers
http application layer protocol designed within framework internet protocol suite definition presumes underlying reliable transport layer protocol4 transmission control protocol commonly used however http adapted unreliable protocols user datagram protocol example httpu simple service discovery protocol ssdp
http resources identified located network uniform resource locators urls using uniform resource identifiers uris schemes http https uris hyperlinks html documents form interlinked hypertext documents
http11 revision original http http10 http10 separate connection server made every resource request http11 reuse connection multiple times download images scripts stylesheets page delivered http11 communications therefore experience less latency establishment connections presents considerable overhead

http sessionedit
http session sequence network requestresponse transactions http client initiates request establishing transmission control protocol connection particular port server typically port occasionally port 8080 list port numbers http server listening port waits clients request message upon receiving request server sends back status line http11 message body message typically requested resource although error message information also returned1
http authenticationedit
http provides multiple authentication schemes basic access authentication digest access authentication operate challengeresponse mechanism whereby server identifies issues challenge serving requested content
http provides general framework access control authentication extensible challengeresponse authentication schemes used server challenge client request client provide authentication information12
authentication realmsedit
http authentication specification also provides arbitrary implementation specific construct dividing resources common given root realm value string present combined canonical root form protection space component challenge effect allows server define separate authentication scopes root uri12
request methodsedit




http request made using telnet request message response header section response body highlighted


http defines methods sometimes referred verbs indicate desired action performed identified resource resource represents whether preexisting data data generated dynamically depends implementation server often resource corresponds file output executable residing server http10 specification13 defined post head methods http11 specification14 added methods options delete trace connect specified documents semantics well known depended client method server configured support combination methods method unknown intermediate treated unsafe nonidempotent method limit number methods defined allows future methods specified without breaking existing infrastructure example webdav defined methods 5789 specified patch method
main article list http header fields


method requests representation specified resource requests using retrieve data effect also true http methods1 published guidance principles distinction saying application design informed principles also relevant limitations15 safe methods
head
head method asks response identical request without response body useful retrieving metainformation written response headers without transport entire content
post
post method requests server accept entity enclosed request subordinate resource identified data posted might example annotation existing resources message bulletin board newsgroup mailing list comment thread block data result submitting form datahandling process item database16

method requests enclosed entity stored supplied refers already existing resource modified point existing resource server create resource uri17
delete
delete method deletes specified resource
trace
trace method echoes received request client changes additions made intermediate servers
options
options method returns http methods server supports specified used check functionality server requesting instead specific resource
connect
connect method converts request connection transparent tcpip tunnel usually facilitate sslencrypted communication https unencrypted http proxy1920 http connect tunneling
patch
patch method applies partial modifications resource21

generalpurpose http servers required implement least head methods22 whenever possible also options methodcitation needed
safe methodsedit
methods example head options trace convention defined safe means intended information retrieval change state server words side effects beyond relatively harmless effects logging caching serving banner advertisements incrementing counter making arbitrary requests without regard context applications state therefore considered safe however mandated standard explicitly acknowledged cannot guaranteed
contrast methods post delete patch intended actions cause side effects either server external side effects financial transactions transmission email methods therefore usually used conforming robots crawlers conform tend make requests without regard context consequences
despite prescribed safety requests practice handling server technically limited therefore careless deliberate programming cause nontrivial changes server discouraged cause problems caching search engines automated agents make unintended changes server example website might allow deletion resource httpexamplecomarticle1234delete arbitrarily fetched even using would simply delete article23
example occurring practice shortlived google accelerator beta prefetched arbitrary urls page user viewing causing records automatically altered deleted masse beta suspended weeks first release following widespread criticism2423
idempotent methods applicationsedit
methods delete defined idempotent meaning multiple identical requests effect single request note idempotence refers state system request completed action server takes deleting record response code returns different subsequent requests system state every timecitation needed methods head options trace prescribed safe also idempotent http stateless protocol1
contrast post method necessarily idempotent therefore sending identical post request multiple times affect state cause side effects financial transactions cases desirable cases could accident user realize action result sending another request receive adequate feedback first request successful browsers show alert dialog boxes warn users cases reloading page resubmit post request generally application handle cases post request submitted
note whether method idempotent enforced protocol server perfectly possible write application example database insert nonidempotent action triggered request ignoring recommendation however result undesirable consequences user agent assumes repeating request safe isnt
securityedit
trace method used part class attacks known crosssite tracing reason common security advice disabled server configuration25 microsoft supports proprietary track method behaves similarly likewise recommended disabled25

status codesedit
also list http status codes
http10 since first line http response called status line includes numeric status code textual reason phrase found user agent handles response primarily depends code secondarily response header fields custom status codes used since user agent encounters code recognize first digit code determine general class response26
standard reason phrases recommendations replaced local equivalents developers discretion status code indicated problem user agent might display reason phrase user provide information nature problem standard also allows user agent attempt interpret reason phrase though might unwise since standard explicitly specifies status codes machinereadable reason phrases humanreadable http status code primarily divided five groups better explanation request responses client server named informational successful redirection client error server error
persistent connectionsedit
main article http persistent connection
http09 connection closed single requestresponse pair http11 keepalivemechanism introduced connection could reused request persistent connections reduce request latency perceptibly client need renegotiate 3wayhandshake connection first request sent another positive side effect general connection becomes faster time tcps slowstartmechanism
version protocol also made bandwidth optimization improvements http10 example http11 introduced chunked transfer encoding allow content persistent connections streamed rather buffered http pipelining reduces time allowing clients send multiple requests waiting response another addition protocol byte serving server transmits portion resource explicitly requested client
http session stateedit
http stateless protocol stateless protocol require http server retain information status user duration multiple requests however applications implement states server side sessions using instance http cookies hidden variables within forms
encrypted connectionsedit
popular establishing encrypted http connection http secure27 methods establishing encrypted http connection also exist secure hypertext transfer protocol using http11 upgrade header specify upgrade browser support however nearly nonexistent282930
message formatedit
client server communicate sending plaintext ascii messages client sends requests server server sends responses
request messageedit
request message consists following

request line imageslogopng http11 requests resource called imageslogopng server
request header fields acceptlanguage
empty line
optional message body

request line header fields must crlf carriage return character followed line feed character empty line must consist crlf whitespace31 http11 protocol header fields except host optional
request line containing path name accepted servers maintain compatibility http clients http10 specification 194532
response messageedit
response message consists following

status line includes status code reason message http11 indicates clients request succeeded
response header fields contenttype texthtml
empty line
optional message body

status line header fields must crlf empty line must consist crlf whitespace31 strict requirement crlf relaxed somewhat within message bodies consistent system linebreaks alone33
