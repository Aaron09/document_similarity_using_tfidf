sömmerings electric telegraph 1809


early studies electricity electrical phenomena known travel great speed many experimenters worked application electricity communications distance
known effects electricity sparks electrostatic attraction chemical changes electric shocks later electromagnetism applied problems detecting controlled transmissions electricity various distances
1753 anonymous writer scots magazine suggested electrostatic telegraph using wire letter alphabet message could transmitted connecting wire terminals turn electrostatic machine observing deflection pith balls end1 telegraphs employing electrostatic attraction basis early experiments electrical telegraphy europe abandoned impractical never developed useful communication systemcitation needed
1774 georgeslouis sage realised early electric telegraph telegraph separate wire letters alphabet range rooms home2
1800 alessandro volta invented voltaic pile allowing continuous current electricity experimentation became source lowvoltage current could used produce distinct effects less limited momentary discharge electrostatic machine leyden jars previously known manmade sources electricity
another early experiment electrical telegraphy electrochemical telegraph created german physician anatomist inventor samuel thomas sömmering 1809 based earlier less robust design 1804 spanish polymath scientist francisco salva campillo3 designs employed multiple wires represent almost latin letters numerals thus messages could conveyed electrically kilometers sömmerings design telegraph receivers wires immersed separate glass tube acid electric current sequentially applied sender various wires representing digit message recipients currents electrolysed acid tubes sequence releasing streams hydrogen bubbles next associated letter numeral telegraph receivers operator would watch bubbles could record transmitted message3 contrast later telegraphs used single wire ground return
hans christian ørsted discovered 1820 electric current produces magnetic field deflect compass needle year johann schweigger invented galvanometer coil wire around compass could used sensitive indicator electric current 1821 andrémarie ampère suggested telegraphy could done system galvanometers wire galvanometer indicate letter said experimented successfully system 1824 peter barlow said system worked distance feet impracticalcitation needed
1825 william sturgeon invented electromagnet single winding uninsulated wire piece varnished iron increased magnetic force produced electric current joseph henry improved 1828 placing several windings insulated wire around creating much powerful electromagnet could operate telegraph high resistance long telegraph wires4 tenure albany academy 1826 1832 henry first demonstrated theory magnetic telegraph ringing bell mile wire strung around room5
1835 joseph henry edward davy invented critical electrical relay davys relay used magnetic needle dipped mercury contact electric current passed surrounding coil6 allowed weak current switch larger current operate powerful local electromagnet long distances78 davy demonstrated telegraph system regents park 1837 granted patent july 1838 also developed electric relay9
