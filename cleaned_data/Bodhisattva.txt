probable early image bodhisattva bimaran casket ce11


kings lanka often described bodhisattvas starting least early sirisanghabodhi 247249 renowned compassion took vows welfare citizens regarded mahāsatta sanskrit mahāsattva epithet used almost exclusively mahayana buddhism12 many lankan kings 15th century also described bodhisattvas royal duties sometimes clearly associated practice pāramitās13
theravadin bhikkhu scholar walpola rahula stated bodhisattva ideal traditionally held higher state śrāvaka mahayana also theravada buddhism also quotes 10th century king lanka mahinda 956972 words inscribed none bodhisattvas become kings prosperous lanka among examples14

fact theravada mahayana unanimously accept bodhisattva ideal highestalthough theravada holds anybody bodhisattva stipulate insist must bodhisattva considered practical

according jeffrey samuels accurately portray differences exist yanas referring mahayana buddhism vehicle bodhisattva ideal universally applied theravada buddhism vehicle bodhisattva ideal reserved appropriated certain exceptional people17
mahāyāna buddhismedit
bodhisattva idealedit
mahāyāna buddhism based principally upon path bodhisattva according nattier term mahāyāna great vehicle originally even honorary synonym bodhisattvayāna bodhisattva vehicle18 aṣṭasāhasrikā prajñāpāramitā sūtra contains simple brief definition term bodhisattva also earliest known mahāyāna definition1920 definition given following21

enlightenment bodhisattvamahāsattva called

earliest depiction bodhisattva path texts ugraparipṛcchā sūtra describe arduous difficult monastic path suited nevertheless glorious path take three kinds bodhisattvas mentioned early mahayana texts forest city monastery bodhisattvas forest dwelling promoted superior even necessary path sutras ugraparipṛcchā samadhiraja sutras22 early rastrapalapariprccha sutra also promotes solitary life meditation forests away distractions householder life rastrapala also highly critical monks living monasteries cities seen practicing meditation morality23 ratnagunasamcayagatha also says bodhisattva undertake ascetic practices dhutanga wander freely without home practice paramitas train guru order perfect meditation practice realization prajnaparamita24 texts seem indicate initial bodhisattva ideal associated strict forest asceticism
mahāyāna buddhism encourages everyone become bodhisattvas take bodhisattva vows vows makes promise work complete enlightenment sentient beings practicing perfections25 indelibly entwined bodhisattva merit transference pariṇāmanā
lotus sūtra life world compared people living house fire people take world reality pursuing worldly projects pleasures without realizing house ablaze soon burn inevitability suffering bodhisattva determination free sentient beings samsara cycle death rebirth suffering type mind known mind awakening bodhicitta
commonly repeated misconception western literature bodhisattvas delay liberation confusion based misreading several different scriptural concepts narratives tibetan teaching three types motivation generating bodhicitta according patrul rinpoches 19th century words perfect teacher bzang gzhal lung bodhisattva might motivated three ways

kinglike bodhicitta aspire become buddha first order help sentient beings
boatmanlike bodhicitta aspire become buddha time sentient beings
shepherdlike bodhicitta aspire become buddha sentient beings done

three types people rather types motivation according patrul rinpoche third quality intention noble though mode buddhahood actually occurs first possible teach others path enlightenment attained enlightenment oneself ritualized formulation bodhisattva also reflects order becoming buddha teach others bodhisattva ritual text attributed nāgārjuna secondthird century states follows past tathāgata arhat samyaksambuddhas engaging behavior bodhisattva generated aspiration unsurpassed complete enlightenment beings liberated beings freed beings relieved beings attain complete nirvana beings placed omniscient wisdom whose name soandso time forward generate aspiration unsurpassed complete enlightenment beings liberated beings freed beings relieved beings attain complete nirvana beings placed omniscient wisdom
another reason misconception bodhisattva delays buddhism bodhisattva rejects liberation śravaka pratyekabuddha described mahāyāna literature either inferior asaṅgas fourth century yogācārabhūmi nonexistent lotus sūtra bodhisattva option pursue lesser path instead chooses long path towards buddhahood five criteria considered bodhisattva four human making become buddha presence previous buddha receiving prophecy buddha
perfections constitute bodhisattva practice confused actual acts benefiting beings bodhisattva vows accomplish buddha perfections mental transformation need actually benefit anyone seen story vessantara incarnation śākyamuni buddha still bodhisattva commits ultimate generosity giving away children evil mistreats vessantaras actual acts benefit beings fact causes direct harm however merit perfection generosity fructifies lifetime śākyamuni buddha attains complete enlightenment
groundsedit
