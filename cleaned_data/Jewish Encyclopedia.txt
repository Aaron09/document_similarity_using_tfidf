singer’s ideaedit
singer conceived jewish encyclopedia europe proposed creating “allgemeine encyklopädia geschichte wissenschaft judenthums” 1891 envisioned twelve volumes published fifteen years costing fifty dollars would contain scientific unbiased articles ancient modern jewish culture proposal received good press coverage interest brockhaus publishing company however house rothschild paris consulted zadoc kahn offered back project minimum funds requested brockaus project abandoned following dreyfus affair associated unpleasantness singer emigrated york city4

editors plunged enormous task soon identified solved inefficiencies project article assignments shuffled around communication practices streamlined joseph jacobs hired coordinator also wrote four hundred articles procured many encyclopedias illustrations herman rosenthal authority russia added editor louis ginzberg joined project later became head rabbinical literature department8
