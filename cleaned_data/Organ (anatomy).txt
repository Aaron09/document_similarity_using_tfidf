complex animals composed organs many organs evolved long time example liver evolved stem vertebrates million years brain even ancient arising ancestor vertebrates insects worms million years
given ancient origin vertebrate organs researchers looked model systems organs evolved recently ideally evolved multiple times independently outstanding model kind research placenta evolved times independently vertebrates evolved relatively recently lineages exists intermediate forms extant taxa4 studies evolution placenta identified variety genetic physiological processes contribute origin evolution organs include repurposing existing animal tissues acquisition functional properties tissues novel interactions distinct tissue types4
