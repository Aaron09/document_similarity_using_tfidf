typesedit
generally four types toxic entities chemical biological physical radiation

chemical toxicants include inorganic substances lead mercury hydrofluoric acid chlorine organic compounds methyl alcohol medications poisons living things weakly radioactive substances uranium also chemical toxicants strongly radioactive materials like radium harmful effects radiation poisoning caused ionizing radiation produced substance rather chemical interactions substance
diseasecausing microorganisms parasites toxic broad sense generally called pathogens rather toxicants biological toxicity pathogens difficult measure threshold dose single organism theoretically virus bacterium worm reproduce cause serious infection however host intact immune system inherent toxicity organism balanced hosts ability fight back effective toxicity combination parts relationship cases cholera disease chiefly caused nonliving substance secreted organism rather organism nonliving biological toxicants generally called toxins produced microorganism plant fungus venoms produced animal
physical toxicants substances physical nature interfere biological processes examples include coal dust asbestos fibers finely divided silicon dioxide ultimately fatal inhaled corrosive chemicals possess physical toxicity destroy tissues theyre directly poisonous unless interfere directly biological activity water physical toxicant taken extremely high doses concentration vital ions decreases dramatically theres much water body asphyxiant gases considered physical toxicants displacing oxygen environment inert chemically toxic gases
already mentioned radiation toxic effect organisms3

measuringedit
toxicity measured effects target organism organ tissue cell individuals typically different levels response dose toxic substance populationlevel measure toxicity often used relates probabilities outcome given individual population measure ld50 data exist estimates made comparison known similar toxic things similar exposures similar organisms safety factors added account uncertainties data evaluation processes example dose toxic substance safe laboratory might assume tenth dose would safe human allowing safety factor allow interspecies differences mammals data fish might factor account greater difference chordate classes fish mammals similarly extra protection factor used individuals believed susceptible toxic effects pregnancy certain diseases newly synthesized previously unstudied chemical believed similar effect another compound could assigned additional protection factor account possible differences effects probably much smaller obviously approach approximate protection factors deliberately conservative method found useful deep variety applications
assessing aspects toxicity cancercausing agents involves additional issues since certain minimal effective dose carcinogens whether risk small addition possible single cell transformed cancer cell takes develop full effect theory
difficult determine toxicity chemical mixtures pure chemical component displays toxicity components interact produce enhanced diminished effects common mixtures include gasoline cigarette smoke industrial waste even complex situations type toxic entity discharge malfunctioning sewage treatment plant chemical biological agents
preclinical toxicity testing various biological systems reveals species organ dose specific toxic effects investigational product toxicity substances observed studying accidental exposures substance vitro studies using cells cell lines vivo exposure experimental animals toxicity tests mostly used examine specific adverse events specific points cancer cardiotoxicity skineye irritation toxicity testing also helps calculate observed adverse effect level noael dose helpful clinical studies4

patch test


skin corrosion irritation determined though skin patch test analysis examines severity damage done incurred long remains whether reversible many test subjects affected
skin corrosion substance must penetrate epidermis dermis within four hours application must reverse damage within days skin irritation shows damage less severe corrosion damage occurs within hours application three consecutive days application within 14day period causes inflammation lasts days test subjects mild skin irritation minor damage less severe irritation within hours application three consecutive days application
serious damage involves tissue damage degradation vision fully reverse days irritation involves changes fully reverse within days

note category established chronic exposure simply contains toxic substance mostly insoluble data acute toxicity
factors influencing toxicityedit
toxicity substance affected many different factors pathway administration whether toxin applied skin ingested inhaled injected time exposure brief encounter long term number exposures single dose multiple doses time physical form toxin solid liquid genetic makeup individual individuals overall health many others several terms used describe factors included

acute exposure
single exposure toxic substance result severe biological harm death acute exposures usually characterized lasting longer
chronic exposure
continuous exposure toxin extended period time often measured months years cause irreversible side effects

etymologyedit
toxic similar words came greek τοξον weapon poisoned arrow came used poison scientific language usual classical greek word poison would transliterate distinctive enough biological names toxo still means toxodon bowtoothed shape
