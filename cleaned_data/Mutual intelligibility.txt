perhaps common reason apparent asymmetric intelligibility speakers variety exposure vice versa example speakers scottish english frequent exposure standard american english movies programs whereas speakers american english little exposure scottish english hence american english speakers often find difficult understand scottish english especially scots differs significantly scottish standard english whereas scots tend problems understanding standard american english
