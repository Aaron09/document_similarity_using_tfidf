apples side stem interior


apple deciduous tree generally standing tall cultivation wild cultivated size shape branch density determined rootstock selection trimming method leaves alternately arranged dark greencolored simple ovals serrated margins slightly downy undersides4
blossoms produced spring simultaneously budding leaves produced spurs long shoots flowers white pink tinge gradually fades five petaled inflorescence consisting cyme flowers central flower inflorescence called king bloom opens first develop larger fruit45
fruit matures late summer autumn cultivars exist wide range sizes commercial growers produce apple diameter market preference consumers especially japan prefer larger apple apples generally used making juice little fresh market value skin ripe apples generally yellow green pink russetted although many tricolored cultivars found6 skin also wholly partly russeted rough brown skin covered protective layer epicuticular wax7 exocarp flesh generally pale yellowishwhite6 though pink yellow exocarps also occur

wild apples grow readily seeds however like perennial fruits apples ordinarily propagated asexually grafting seedling apples example extreme heterozygotes rather inheriting parents create apple characteristics instead significantly different parents43 triploid cultivars additional reproductive barrier sets chromosomes cannot divided evenly meiosis yielding unequal segregation chromosomes aneuploids even case triploid plant produce seed apples example occurs infrequently seedlings rarely survive44
apples breed true planted seeds grafting generally used produce apple trees rootstock used bottom graft selected produce trees large variety sizes well changing winter hardiness insect disease resistance soil preference resulting tree dwarf rootstocks used produce small trees less high maturity bear fruit earlier life cycle full size trees45 dwarf rootstocks apple trees traced back area persia asia minor alexander great sent samples dwarf apple trees aristotles lyceum dwarf rootstocks became common 15th century later went several cycles popularity decline throughout world46 majority rootstocks used today control size apples developed england early 1900s east malling research station conducted extensive research rootstocks today rootstocks given prefix designate origin rootstocks marked prefix mallingseries cultivars later crossed trees northern merton england47

pollination
also fruit tree pollination




apple blossom ayrshire cultivar






orchard mason apple bloom british columbia canada


apples selfincompatible must crosspollinate develop fruit flowering season apple growers often utilize pollinators carry pollen honey bees commonly used orchard mason bees also used supplemental pollinators commercial orchards bumblebee queens sometimes present orchards usually enough quantity significant pollinators4951
four seven pollination groups apples depending climate

group early flowering england gravenstein astrachan
group idared mcintosh
group midseason flowering granny smith coxs orange pippin
group midlate season flowering golden delicious calville blanc dhiver
group late flowering braeburn reinette dorléans
group suntan
group courtpendu gris also called courtpendu plat

cultivar pollinated compatible cultivar group close
cultivars sometimes classified peak bloom average 30day blossom period pollenizers selected cultivars within 6day overlap period
maturation harvest
also fruit picking fruit tree pruning
cultivars vary yield ultimate size tree even grown rootstock cultivars left unpruned grow large allows bear much fruit makes harvesting difficult depending tree density number trees planted unit surface area mature trees typically bear 40–200 90–440 apples year though productivity close zero poor years apples harvested using threepoint ladders designed amongst branches trees grafted dwarfing rootstocks bear 10–80 20–180 fruit year49
farms apple orchards open public consumers pick apples purchase53

storage
commercially apples stored months controlled atmosphere chambers delay ethyleneinduced ripening apples commonly stored chambers higher concentrations carbon dioxide high filtration prevents ethylene concentrations rising higher amounts preventing ripening occurring quickly ripening continues fruit removed storagecitation needed
home storage cultivars apple held approximately weeks kept coolest part refrigerator stored year without significant degradationdubious discuss54verification needed varieties apples granny smith fuji three times storage life others55
nonorganic apples sprayed 1methylcyclopropene blocking apples ethylene receptors temporarily preventing ripening56
