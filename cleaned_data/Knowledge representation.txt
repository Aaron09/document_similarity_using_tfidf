earliest work computerized knowledge representation focused general problem solvers general problem solver system developed allen newell herbert simon 1959 systems featured data structures planning decomposition system would begin goal would decompose goal subgoals construct strategies could accomplish subgoal
early days general search algorithms also developed however amorphous problem definitions systems meant worked constrained domains blocks world order tackle nontoy problems researchers feigenbaum frederick hayesroth realized necessary focus systems constrained problems
failure efforts cognitive revolution psychology phase focused knowledge representation resulted expert systems 1970s production systems frame languages rather general problem solvers changed focus expert systems could match human competence specific task medical diagnosis
expert systems gave terminology still today systems divided knowledge base facts world rules inference engine applies rules knowledge base order answer questions solve problems early systems knowledge base tended fairly flat structure essentially assertions values variables used rules2
addition expert systems researchers developed concept frame based languages 1980s frame similar object class abstract description category describing things world problems potential solutions frames originally used systems geared toward human interaction understanding natural language social settings various default expectations ordering food restaurant narrow search space allow system choose appropriate responses dynamic situations
wasnt long frame communities rulebased researchers realized synergy approaches frames good representing real world described classes subclasses slots data values various constraints possible values rules good representing utilizing complex logic process make medical diagnosis integrated systems developed combined frames rules powerful well known 1983 knowledge engineering environment intellicorp complete rule engine forward backward chaining also complete frame based knowledge base triggers slots data values inheritance message passing although message passing originated objectoriented community rather quickly embraced researchers well environments operating systems lisp machines symbolics xerox texas instruments3
integration frames rules objectoriented programming significantly driven commercial ventures symbolics spun various research projects time occurring another strain research less commercially focused driven mathematical logic automated theorem proving influential languages research klone language klone frame language rigorous semantics formal definitions concepts relation4 klone languages influenced loom automated reasoning engine based formal logic rather ifthen rules reasoner called classifier classifier analyze declarations infer assertions example redefine class subclass superclass class wasnt formally specified classifier function inference engine deducing facts existing knowledge base classifier also provide consistency checking knowledge base case klone languages also referred ontology5
another area knowledge representation research problem common sense reasoning first realizations trying make software function human natural language humans regularly draw extensive foundation knowledge real world simply take granted obvious artificial agent basic principles common sense physics causality intentions example frame problem event driven logic need axioms state things maintain position moment next unless moved external force order make true artificial intelligence agent converse humans using natural language process basic statements questions world essential represent kind knowledge ambitious programs tackle problem doug lenats project established frame language large numbers analysts document various areas common sense reasoning language knowledge recorded included common sense models time causality physics intentions many others6
starting point knowledge representation knowledge representation hypothesis first formalized brian smith 19857

knowledgerepresentation field artificial intelligence focuses designing computer representations capture information world used solve complex problems
justification knowledge representation conventional procedural code best formalism solve complex problems knowledge representation makes complex software easier define maintain procedural code used expert systems
example talking experts terms business rules rather code lessens semantic users developers makes development complex systems practical
knowledge representation goes hand hand automated reasoning main purposes explicitly representing knowledge able reason knowledge make inferences assert knowledge virtually knowledge representation languages reasoning inference engine part system10
tradeoff design knowledge representation formalism expressivity practicality ultimate knowledge representation formalism terms expressive power compactness first order logic powerful formalism used mathematicians define general propositions world however drawbacks knowledge representation formalism ease practicality implementation first order logic intimidating even many software developers languages complete formal power still provide close expressive power user interface practical average developer understand issue practicality implementation ways expressive possible create statements quantification infinite sets would cause system never terminate attempted verify
thus subset easier practical implement driving motivation behind rulebased expert systems ifthen rules provide subset useful also intuitive history early knowledge representation formalisms databases semantic nets theorem provers production systems viewed various design decisions whether emphasize expressive power computability efficiency11
1993 paper topic randall davis outlined five distinct roles analyze knowledge representation framework12

knowledge representation fundamentally surrogate substitute thing used enable entity determine consequences thinking rather acting reasoning world rather taking action
ontological commitments answer question terms think world
fragmentary theory intelligent reasoning expressed terms three components representations fundamental conception intelligent reasoning inferences representation sanctions inferences recommends
medium pragmatically efficient computation computational environment thinking accomplished contribution pragmatic efficiency supplied guidance representation provides organizing information facilitate making recommended inferences
medium human expression language things world

knowledge representation reasoning enabling technology semantic languages based frame model automatic classification provide layer semantics existing internet rather searching text strings typical today possible define logical queries find pages queries13 automated reasoning component systems engine known classifier classifiers focus subsumption relations knowledge base rather rules classifier infer classes dynamically change ontology information becomes available capability ideal everchanging evolving information space internet14
semantic integrates concepts knowledge representation reasoning markup languages based resource description framework provides basic capabilities define knowledgebased objects internet basic features relations object properties ontology language adds additional semantics integrates automatic classification reasoners15
