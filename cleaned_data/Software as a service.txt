historyedit
centralized hosting business applications dates back 1960s starting decade mainframe providers conducted service bureau business often referred timesharing utility computing services included offering computing power database storage banks large organizations worldwide data centerscitation needed
expansion internet 1990s brought class centralized computing called application service providers asps provided businesses service hosting managing specialized business applications goal reducing costs central administration solution providers specialization particular business application worlds pioneers largest asps headquartered washington area futurelink corporation headquartered irvine california11
software service essentially extends idea model term software service saas however commonly used specific settings

initial asps focused managing hosting thirdparty independent software vendors software 2012update saas vendors typically develop manage software
whereas many initial asps offered traditional clientserver applications require installation software users personal computers saas solutions today rely predominantly require browser
whereas software architecture used initial asps mandated maintaining separate instance application business 2012update saas solutions normally utilize multitenant architecture application serves multiple businesses users partitions data accordingly

acronym allegedly first appeared article called strategic backgrounder software service internally published february 2001 software information industry associations siia ebusiness division12
dbaas database service emerged subvariety saas13
distributionedit
cloud saas model physical need indirect distribution distributed physically deployed almost instantaneously therefore partners middlemen traditional kind necessary however market grown saas managed service players forced redefine role14
pricingedit
unlike traditional software conventionally sold perpetual license upfront cost optional ongoing support saas providers generally price applications using subscription commonly monthly annual fee15 consequently initial setup cost saas typically lower equivalent enterprise software saas vendors typically price applications based usage parameters number users using application however saas environment customers data reside saas vendor opportunities also exist charge transaction event unit value number processors required16
relatively cost user provisioning setting customer multitenant environment enables saas vendors offer applications using freemium model16 model free service made available limited functionality scope fees charged enhanced functionality larger scope16 saas applications completely free users revenue derived alternative sources advertising17
driver saas growth saas vendors ability provide price competitive onpremises software consistent traditional rationale outsourcing systems involves applying economies scale application operation outside service provider able offer better cheaper reliable applicationscitation needed
architectureedit
vast majority saas solutions based multitenant architecture model single version application single configuration hardware network operating system used customers tenants support scalability application installed multiple machines called horizontal scaling cases second version application offer select group customers access prerelease versions applications beta version testing purposes contrasted traditional software multiple physical copies software potentially different version potentially different configuration often customized installed across various customer sites traditional model version application based unique code18
although exception rather norm saas solutions multitenancy mechanisms—such virtualization—to costeffectively manage large number customers place multitenancy19 whether multitenancy necessary component software service topic controversy20
main varieties saas

characteristicsedit
although softwareasaservice applications share traits characteristics common among many saas applications
configuration customizationedit
saas applications similarly support traditionally known application configuration words like traditional enterprise software single customer alter configuration options parameters affect functionality lookandfeel customer settings parameter values configuration options application customized degree designed based predefined configuration options
example support customers common need change applications lookandfeel application appears customers brand or—if desired—cobranded many saas applications customers provide self service interface working application provider staff custom logo sometimes custom colors customer cannot however change page layout unless option designed
accelerated feature deliveryedit
saas applications often updated frequently traditional software22 many cases weekly monthly basis enabled several factors

application hosted centrally update decided executed provider customers
application single configuration making development testing faster
application vendor expend resources updating maintaining backdated versions software single version23
application vendor access customer data expediting design regression testing
solution provider access user behavior within application usually analytics making easier identify areas worthy improvement

accelerated feature delivery enabled agile software development methodologies24 methodologies evolved mid1990s provide software development tools practices support frequent software releases
open integration protocolsedit
saas applications cannot access companys internal systems databases internal services predominantly offer integration protocols25 application programming interfaces apis operate wide area network typically protocols based http rest soap
ubiquity saas applications internet services standardization technology spawned development mashups lightweight applications combine data presentation functionality multiple services creating compound service mashups differentiate saas applications onpremises software latter cannot easily integrated outside companys firewall
collaborative social functionalityedit
inspired success online social networks socalled functionality many saas applications offer features users collaborate share information
example many project management applications delivered saas model offer—in addition traditional project planning functionality—collaboration features letting users comment tasks plans share documents within outside organization several saas applications users vote offer feature ideas
although collaborationrelated functionality also integrated onpremises software implicit explicit collaboration users different customers possible centrally hosted software
adoption driversedit
several important changes software market technology landscape facilitated acceptance growth saas solutions

growing webbased user interfaces applications along proliferation associated practices design continuously decreased need traditional clientserver applications consequently traditional software vendors investment software based clients become disadvantage mandating ongoing support opening door software vendors offering user experience perceived modern
standardization page technologies html javascript increasing popularity development practice introduction ubiquity application frameworks like ruby rails laravel gradually reduced cost developing saas solutions enabled solution providers come competitive solutions challenging traditional vendors
increasing penetration broadband internet access enabled remote centrally hosted applications offer speed comparable onpremises software
standardization https protocol part stack provided universally available lightweight security sufficient everyday applications
introduction wide acceptance lightweight integration protocols rest soap enabled affordable integration saas applications residing cloud internal applications wide area networks saas applications

adoption challengesedit
limitations slow acceptance saas prohibit used cases

data stored vendors servers data security becomes issue26
saas applications hosted cloud away application users introduces latency environment example saas model suitable applications demand response times milliseconds
multitenant architectures drive cost efficiency saas solution providers limit customization applications large clients inhibiting applications used scenarios applicable mostly large enterprises customization necessary
business applications require access integration customers current data data large volume sensitive users personal information integrating remotely hosted software costly risky conflict data governance regulations
constitutional searchseizure warrant laws protect forms saas dynamically stored data result link added chain security access data extension misuse data limited assumed honesty parties government agencies able access data recognizance2728293031
switching saas vendors involve slow difficult task transferring large data files internet
organizations adopt saas find forced adopting versions might result unforeseen training costs increase probability user might make error instability bugs newer software
vendor software business suddenly software user lose access software unexpectedly could destabilize organizations current future projects well leave user older data longer access modify
relying internet connection means data transferred saas firm internet speeds rather potentially higher speeds firm’s internal network32
saas hosting company guarantee uptime level agreed service level agreement

standard model also limitations

compatibility hardware software operating systems33
licensing compliance problems unauthorized copies software program putting organization risk fines litigation
maintenance support patch revision processes

engineering applicationsedit
engineering simulation software traditionally delivered onpremises solution users desktop ideal candidate saas delivery market saas engineering simulation software infancy interest concept growing similar reasons interest saas growing industries main driver traditional engineering simulation software required large upfront investment order access simulation software large investment kept engineering simulation inaccessible many startups middle market companies reluctant unable risk large software expenditure unproven projects34
healthcare applicationsedit
according survey himss analytics healthcare organizations using cloud services planning whereas healthcare organizations currently running saasbased applications35
data escrowedit
software service data escrow process keeping copy critical softwareasaservice application data independent third party similar source code escrow critical software source code stored independent third party saas data escrow logic applied data within saas application allows companies protect insure data resides within saas applications protecting data loss36
many varied reasons considering saas data escrow including concerns vendor bankruptcy3738 unplanned service outages potential data loss corruption many businesses also keen ensure complying data governance standards want improved reporting business analytics saas data research conducted clearpace software growth saas showed percent participants wanted take copy saas data third participants wanted copy daily basis39
criticismedit
notable criticism saas comes richard stallman free software foundation referring service software substitute saass40 considers saas violation principles free software41 according stallman

saas users copy executable file server users cant touch thus impossible ascertain really impossible change saas inherently gives server operator power change software users data operated

criticism apply saas products 2010 forbes contributor woods noted drupal gardens free hosting platform based open source drupal content management system open source model saas added

open source provides escape hatch drupal gardens users able press button source code version drupal code runs site along data database take code hosting companies anything would like do42

similarly mediawiki wordpress many extensions increasingly used wide variety internal applications well public services duplicating code relatively simple integration existing extensions plugins templates actual customizations rare usually quickly replaced standard publicly available extensions additionally guarantee software source code obtained means accurately reflects software system claims reflect
andrew hoppin former chief information officer york state senate refers combination saas open source software opensaas points wordpress another successful example opensaas software delivery model gives customers best worlds options fact open source means start building websites selfhosting wordpress customizing website heart’s content concurrently fact wordpress saas means don’t manage website simply wordpresscom host it43 cloud saas model physical need indirect distribution distributed physically deployed almost instantaneously therefore partners middlemen traditional kind necessary
