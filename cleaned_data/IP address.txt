address ipv4 32bits size limits address space 4294967296 addresses number ipv4 reserves addresses special purposes private networks million addresses multicast addresses million addresses
ipv4 addresses usually represented dotdecimal notation consisting four decimal numbers ranging separated dots 172162541 part represents group bits octet address cases technical writing ipv4 addresses presented various hexadecimal octal binary representations
subnetting
early stages development internet protocol1 network administrators interpreted address parts network number portion host number portion highest order octet significant eight bits address designated network number remaining bits called rest field host identifier used host numbering within network
early method soon proved inadequate additional networks developed independent existing networks already designated network number 1981 internet addressing specification revised introduction classful network architecture4
classful network design allowed larger number individual network assignments finegrained subnetwork design first three bits significant octet address defined class address three classes defined universal unicast addressing depending class derived network identification based octet boundary segments entire address class used successively additional octets network identifier thus reducing possible number hosts higher order classes following table gives overview obsolete system

private addresses
early network design global endtoend connectivity envisioned communications internet hosts intended addresses uniquely assigned particular computer device however found always necessary private networks developed public address space needed conserved
computers connected internet factory machines communicate tcpip need globally unique addresses three nonoverlapping ranges ipv4 addresses private networks reserved 1918 addresses routed internet thus need coordinated address registry

ipv6 address size increased bits ipv4 bits octets thus providing 2128 approximately 7038340299999999999♠3403×1038 addresses deemed sufficient foreseeable future
intent design provide sufficient quantity addresses also redesign routing internet efficient aggregation subnetwork routing prefixes resulted slower growth routing tables routers smallest possible individual allocation subnet hosts square size entire ipv4 internet levels actual address utilization ratios small ipv6 network segment design also provides opportunity separate addressing infrastructure network segment local administration segments available space addressing prefix used route traffic external networks ipv6 facilities automatically change routing prefix entire networks global connectivity routing policy change without requiring internal redesign manual renumbering
large number ipv6 addresses allows large blocks assigned specific purposes appropriate aggregated efficient routing large address space need complex address conservation methods used cidr
modern desktop enterprise server operating systems include native support ipv6 protocol widely deployed devices residential networking routers voice voip multimedia equipment network peripherals
private addresses
ipv4 reserves addresses private networks blocks addresses aside ipv6 ipv6 referred unique local addresses 4193 reserves routing prefix fc007 block divided blocks different implied policies addresses include 40bit pseudorandom number minimizes risk address collisions sites merge packets misrouted11
early practices used different block purpose fec0 dubbed sitelocal addresses12 however definition constituted sites remained unclear poorly defined addressing policy created ambiguities routing address type abandoned must used systems13
addresses starting fe80 called linklocal addresses assigned interfaces communication attached link addresses automatically generated operating system network interface provides instant automatic communication ipv6 host link feature required lower layers ipv6 network administration neighbor discovery protocol
private address prefixes routed public internet
subnetworks
networks divided subnetworks ipv4 ipv6 purpose address logically recognized consisting parts network prefix host identifier interface identifier ipv6 subnet mask cidr prefix determines address divided network host parts
term subnet mask used within ipv4 versions however cidr concept notation address followed slash number decimal bits used network part also called routing prefix example ipv4 address subnet mask 192021 2552552550 respectively cidr notation address subnet 19202124 first bits address indicate network subnet
address assignment
addresses assigned host either dynamically time booting permanently fixed configuration host hardware software persistent configuration also known using static address contrast computers address assigned newly time restarts known using dynamic address
configuration static address depends detail software hardware installed computer computers used network infrastructure routers mail servers typically configured static addressing static addresses also sometimes convenient locating servers inside enterprisecitation needed
dynamic addresses assigned using methods zeroconf selfconfiguration dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp network server address assigned dhcp usually expiration period address assigned another device originally associated host still powered network administrator implement dhcp method host always receives specific address
dhcp frequently used technology assigning addresses avoids administrative burden assigning specific static addresses device network also allows devices share limited address space network online particular time typically dynamic configuration enabled default modern desk operating systems dhcp technology used assign addresses dynamically dialup broadband networks dynamic address features pointtopoint protocol
absence failure static stateful dhcp address configurations operating system assign address network interface using stateless autoconfiguration methods zeroconf
sticky dynamic address
sticky dynamic address informal term used cable internet access subscribers describe dynamically assigned address seldom changes addresses usually assigned dhcp since modems usually powered extended periods time address leases usually long periods simply renewed modem turned powered next expiration address lease often receives address
address autoconfiguration
3330 defines address block 1692540016 special linklocal addressing ipv4 networks ipv6 every interface whether using static dynamic address assignments also receives locallink address automatically block fe8010
addresses valid link local network segment pointtopoint connection host connected addresses routable like private addresses cannot source destination packets traversing internet
linklocal ipv4 address block reserved standards existed mechanisms address autoconfiguration filling void microsoft created implementation called automatic private addressing apipa apipa deployed millions machines thus become facto standard industry 3927 ietf defined formal standard functionality entitled dynamic configuration ipv4 linklocal addresses
addressing conflicts
address conflict occurs devices local physical wireless network claim address second assignment address generally stops functionality devices many modern operating systems notify administrator address conflicts1415 devices gateway network crippled addresses assigned multiple people systems differing methods fault1617181920
routing
addresses classified several classes operational characteristics unicast multicast anycast broadcast addressing
unicast addressing
common concept address unicast addressing available ipv4 ipv6 normally refers single sender single receiver used sending receiving usually unicast address associated single device host device host unicast address individual several distinct unicast addresses distinct purpose sending data multiple unicast addresses requires sender send data many times recipient
broadcast addressing
main article broadcasting computing
ipv4 possible send data possible destinations allhosts broadcast permits sender send data receivers receive copy ipv4 protocol address 255255255255 used local broadcast addition directed limited broadcast made combining network prefix host suffix composed entirely binary example destination address used directed broadcast devices 19202024 network 19202255 ipv6 implement broadcast addressing replaces multicast speciallydefined allnodes multicast address
multicast addressing
multicast address associated group interested receivers ipv4 addresses 224000 239255255255 former class addresses designated multicast addresses21 ipv6 uses address block prefix ff008 multicast applications either case sender sends single datagram unicast address multicast group address intermediary routers take care making copies sending receivers joined corresponding multicast group
anycast addressing
like broadcast multicast anycast onetomany routing topology however data stream transmitted receivers router decides logically closest network anycast address inherent feature ipv6 ipv4 anycast addressing implementations typically operate using shortestpath metric routing take account congestion attributes path anycast methods useful global load balancing commonly used distributed systems
public address
public address common parlance globally routable unicast address meaning address address reserved private networks reserved 1918 various ipv6 address formats local scope sitelocal scope example linklocal addressing public addresses used communication hosts global internet
firewalling
security privacy considerations network administrators often desire restrict public internet traffic within private networks source destination addresses contained headers packet convenient means discriminate traffic address blocking selectively tailoring responses external requests internal servers achieved firewall software running networks gateway router database addresses permissible traffic maintained blacklists whitelists
address translation
multiple client devices appear share address either part shared hosting server environment ipv4 network address translator proxy server acts intermediary agent behalf client case real originating address might masked server receiving request common practice mask large number devices private network outside interfaces needs internetroutable address22
commonly device maps port numbers side larger public network individual private addresses masqueraded network
residential networks functions usually implemented residential gateway scenario computers connected router private addresses router public address external interface communicate internet internal computers appear share public address
diagnostic tools
computer operating systems provide various diagnostic tools examine network interface address configuration windows provides commandline interface tools ipconfig netsh users unixlike systems ifconfig netstat route lanstat fstat iproute2 utilities accomplish task
