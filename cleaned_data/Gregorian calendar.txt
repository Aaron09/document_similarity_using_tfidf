detail popes tomb camillo rusconi completed 1723 antonio lilio genuflecting pope presenting printed calendar


gregorian calendar reform julian calendar instituted 1582 pope gregory xiii calendar named papal bull inter gravissimas dated february 15823 motivation adjustment bring date celebration easter time year celebrated introduced early church although recommendation first council nicaea specified christians celebrate easter took almost five centuries virtually christians achieved objective adopting rules church alexandria easter issues arosenote
background
information computus
date easter tied spring equinox roman catholic church considered seasonal drift date easter undesirable church alexandria celebrated easter sunday 14th moon computed using metonic cycle falls vernal equinox placed march however church rome still regarded march lady equinox used different cycle compute moon12 alexandrian system since 14th easter moon could fall earliest march first could fall earlier march later april meant easter varied march april rome easter allowed fall later april parilia birthday rome pagan festival first easter moon could fall earlier march later april
easter sunday 15th moon whose 14th allowed precede equinox systems produced different dates generally compromise churches able celebrate 10th century churches except eastern border byzantine empire adopted alexandrian easter still placed vernal equinox march although bede already noted drift 725—it drifted even 16th century13
worse reckoned moon used compute easter fixed julian year 19year cycle approximation built error every years 16th century lunar calendar phase real moon four days
european scholars well aware calendar drift since early medieval period bede writing century showed accumulated error three days roger bacon 1200 estimated error seven eight days dante writing 1300 aware need calendar reform first attempt forward reform undertaken pope sixtus 1475 invited regiomontanus vatican purpose however project interrupted death regiomontanus shortly arrival rome14 increase astronomical knowledge precision observations towards 15th century made question pressing numerous publications following decades called calendar reform among paper sent vatican university salamanca 1515citation needed project taken 1540s implemented pope gregory xiii 1572–1585
preparation
1545 council trent authorized pope paul reform calendar requiring date vernal equinox restored held time first council nicaea alteration calendar designed prevent future drift would allow consistent accurate scheduling feast easter
1577 compendium sent expert mathematicians outside reform commission comments experts including giambattista benedetti giuseppe moleto believed easter computed true motions moon rather using tabular method recommendations adopted15 reform adopted modification proposal made calabrian doctor aloysius lilius lilio4
liliuss proposal included reducing number leap years four centuries making three four centurial years common instead leap years also produced original practical scheme adjusting epacts moon calculating annual date easter solving longstanding obstacle calendar reform
ancient tables provided suns mean longitude1617 christopher clavius architect gregorian calendar noted tables agreed neither time passed vernal equinox length mean tropical year tycho brahe also noticed discrepancies1819 gregorian leap year rule leap years years forward petrus pitatus verona 1560 noted consistent tropical year alfonsine tables mean tropical year copernicus revolutionibus reinhold prutenic tables three mean tropical years babylonian sexagesimals excess days would extracted tables mean longitude 1433957 alphonsine 14331112 copernicus 1433924 reinhold values places 1433 also mean length gregorian year thus pitatus solution would commended astronomers20
liliuss proposals components firstly proposed correction length year mean tropical year 36524219 days long21 average length julian year 36525 days julian year almost minutes longer mean tropical year discrepancy results drift three days every years liliuss proposal resulted average year 3652425 days accuracy time gregorys reform already drift days since council nicaea resulting vernal equinox falling march instead ecclesiastically fixed date march unreformed would drift lilius proposed 10day drift corrected deleting julian leap occurrences period forty years thereby providing gradual return equinox march
liliuss work expanded upon christopher clavius closely argued 800page volume would later defend liliuss work detractors claviuss opinion correction take place move advice prevailed gregory
second component consisted approximation would provide accurate simple rulebased calendar liliuss formula 10day correction revert drift since council nicaea imposition leap years rather year proposed rule years divisible would leap years divisible well
19year cycle used lunar calendar also corrected every years times 2500 years along corrections years longer leap years 1700 1800 1900 2100 fact method computing date easter introduced
