weight displaced fluid directly proportional volume displaced fluid surrounding fluid uniform density simple terms principle states buoyancy force object equal weight fluid displaced object density fluid multiplied submerged volume times gravitational acceleration thus among completely submerged objects equal masses objects greater volume greater buoyancy also known upthrust

pressure distribution immersed cube






forces immersed cube






approximation arbitrary volume group cubes


simplified explanation integration pressure contact area stated follows
consider cube immersed fluid upper surface horizontal
sides identical area depth distribution therefore also pressure distribution consequently total force resulting hydrostatic pressure exerted perpendicular plane surface side
pairs opposing sides therefore resultant horizontal forces balance orthogonal directions resultant force zero
upward force cube pressure bottom surface integrated area surface constant depth pressure constant therefore integral pressure area horizontal bottom surface cube hydrostatic pressure depth multiplied area bottom surface
similarly downward force cube pressure surface integrated area surface constant depth pressure constant therefore integral pressure area horizontal surface cube hydrostatic pressure depth multiplied area surface
cube bottom surfaces identical shape area pressure difference bottom cube directly proportional depth difference resultant force difference exactly equal weight fluid would occupy volume cube absence
means resultant upward force cube equal weight fluid would volume cube downward force cube weight absence external forces
analogy valid variations size cube
cubes placed alongside face contact pressures resultant forces sides parts thereof contact balanced disregarded contact surfaces equal shape size pressure distribution therefore buoyancy cubes contact buoyancies cube analogy extended arbitrary number cubes
object shape approximated group cubes contact size cube decreased precision approximation increases limiting case infinitely small cubes exact equivalence
angled surfaces nullify analogy resultant force split orthogonal components dealt
static stabilityedit
main article ship stability




illustration stability bottomheavy left topheavy right ships respect positions centres buoyancy gravity


floating object stable tends restore equilibrium position small displacement example floating objects generally vertical stability object pushed slightly create greater buoyancy force unbalanced weight force push object back
rotational stability great importance floating vessels given small angular displacement vessel return original position stable move away original position unstable remain neutral
rotational stability depends relative lines action forces object upward buoyancy force object acts center buoyancy centroid displaced volume fluid weight force object acts center gravity buoyant object stable center gravity beneath center buoyancy angular displacement produce righting moment
stability buoyant object surface complex remain stable even centre gravity centre buoyancy provided disturbed equilibrium position centre buoyancy moves side centre gravity moves thus providing positive righting moment occurs floating object said positive metacentric height situation typically valid range heel angles beyond centre buoyancy move enough provide positive righting moment object becomes unstable possible shift positive negative vice versa heeling disturbance many shapes stable position
