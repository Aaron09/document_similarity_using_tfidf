unusual property frozen atmospheric pressure solid approximately less dense liquid water density 09167 gcm3 whereas water density 09998 gcm³ temperature liquid water densest essentially gcm³ becomes less dense water molecules begin form hexagonal crystals6 freezing point reached hydrogen bonding dominating intermolecular forces results packing molecules less compact solid density increases slightly decreasing temperature value 09340 gcm³ −180

slipperiness




frozen waterfall southeast york


originally thought slippery pressure object coming contact melting thin layer allowing object glide across surface12 example blade skate upon exerting pressure would melt thin layer providing lubrication blade explanation called pressure melting originated 19th century however account skating temperatures lower often skated upon
another equally explanation slippery molecules interface cannot properly bond molecules mass beneath thus free move like molecules liquid water molecules remain semiliquid state providing lubrication regardless pressure exerted object however significance hypothesis disputed experiments showing high coefficient friction using atomic force microscopy13
20th century explanation called friction heating proposed whereby friction material cause layer melting however theory sufficiently explain slippery standing still even belowzero temperatures12
recently comprehensive theory friction takes account abovementioned friction mechanisms presented14 model allows quantitative estimation friction coefficient various materials function temperature sliding speed typical conditions related winter sports tires vehicle melting thin layer frictional heating primary reason slipperiness
