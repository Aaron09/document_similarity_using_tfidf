main article sports biomechanics
sports biomechanics laws mechanics applied human movement order gain greater understanding athletic performance reduce sport injuries well focuses application scientific principles mechanical physics understand movements action human bodies sports implements cricket hockey stick javelin elements mechanical engineering strain gauges electrical engineering digital filtering computer science numerical methods gait analysis force platforms clinical neurophysiology surface common methods used sports biomechanics4
biomechanics sports stated muscular joint skeletal actions body execution given task skill andor technique proper understanding biomechanics relating sports skill greatest implications sports performance rehabilitation injury prevention along sport mastery noted doctor michael yessis could best athlete executes skill best5
continuum biomechanicsedit
mechanical analysis biomaterials biofluids usually carried forth concepts continuum mechanics assumption breaks length scales interest approach order micro structural details material remarkable characteristic biomaterials hierarchical structure words mechanical characteristics materials rely physical phenomena occurring multiple levels molecular tissue organ levels
biomaterials classified groups hard soft tissues mechanical deformation hard tissues like wood shell bone analysed theory linear elasticity hand soft tissues like skin tendon muscle cartilage usually undergo large deformations thus analysis rely finite strain theory computer simulations interest continuum biomechanics spurred need realism development medical simulation6568

blood cells


biological fluid mechanics biofluid mechanics study liquid fluid flows around biological organisms often studied liquid biofluids problem blood flow human cardiovascular system certain mathematical circumstances blood flow modelled navier–stokes equations vivo whole blood assumed incompressible newtonian fluid however assumption fails considering forward flow within arterioles microscopic scale effects individual blood cells become significant whole blood longer modelled continuum diameter blood vessel slightly larger diameter blood cell fahraeus–lindquist effect occurs decrease wall shear stress however diameter blood vessel decreases blood cells squeeze vessel often pass single file case inverse fahraeus–lindquist effect occurs wall shear stress increases
example gaseous biofluids problem human respiration recently respiratory systems insects studied bioinspiration designing improved microfluidic devices7
biotribologyedit
main aspects contact mechanics tribology related friction wear lubrication surfaces come contact motion friction wear lubrication effects important analyze order determine performance material biotribology study friction wear lubrication biological systems especially human joints hips knees8 example femoral tibial components knee implant routinely daily activity walking stair climbing performance tibial component needs analyzed principles biotribology used determine wear performance implant lubrication effects synovial fluid addition theory contact mechanics also becomes important wear analysis additional aspects biotribology also include analysis subsurface damage resulting surfaces coming contact motion rubbing evaluation tissue engineered cartilage9

1543 galen’s work function parts challenged andreas vesalius vesalius published work called structure human body work vesalius corrected many errors made galen would globally accepted many centuries death copernicus came desire understand learn world around people works deathbed published work revolutions heavenly spheres work revolutionized science physics also development mechanics later biomechanics16
galileo galilee father mechanics part time biomechanic born years death copernicus galileo spent many years medical school often questioned everything professors taught found professors could prove taught moved onto mathematics everything proven went pisa taught mathematics good lecturer students would leave instructors hear speak forced resign became professor even prestigious school padua spirit teachings would lead world direction science years science galileo made biomechanical aspects known example discovered animals masses increase disproportionately size bones must consequently also disproportionately increase girth adapting loadbearing rather mere size bending strength tubular structure bone increased relative weight making hollow increasing diameter marine animals larger terrestrial animals waters buoyancy relieves tissues weight17
galileo galilei interested strength bones suggested bones hollow affords maximum strength minimum weight noted animals bone masses increased disproportionately size consequently bones must also increase disproportionately girth rather mere size bending strength tubular structure bone much efficient relative weight mason suggests insight first grasps principles biological optimization15
