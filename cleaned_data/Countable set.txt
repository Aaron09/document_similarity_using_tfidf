countable exists injective function natural numbers
found also surjective therefore bijective called countably infinite
words countably infinite onetoone correspondence natural number

historyedit
1874 first theory article cantor proved real numbers uncountable thus showing infinite sets countable6 1878 used onetoone correspondences define compare cardinalities7 1883 extended natural numbers infinite ordinals used sets ordinals produce infinity sets different infinite cardinalities8
introductionedit
collection elements described many ways simply list elements example consisting integers denoted effective small sets however larger sets would timeconsuming errorprone instead listing every single element sometimes ellipsis used writer believes reader easily guess missing example presumably denotes integers even case however still possible list elements finite

bijective mapping integer even numbers


understand means first examine mean example infinitely many integers infinitely many even integers hence infinitely many integers overall however turns number even integers number integers also number integers overall arrange things every integer distinct even integer −2→−4 −1→−2 generally n→2n picture done arranged integers even integers onetoone correspondence bijection function maps sets element corresponds single element
however infinite sets cardinality example georg cantor introduced concept demonstrated real numbers cannot onetoone correspondence natural numbers nonnegative integers therefore real numbers greater cardinality natural numbers
countable finite cardinality size natural numbers equivalently countable cardinality subset natural numbers otherwise uncountable
formal overview without detailsedit
definition countable exists injective function natural numbers
might seem natural divide sets different classes sets containing element together sets containing elements together finally together infinite sets consider size view tenable however natural definition size
elaborate need concept bijection although bijection seems advanced concept number usual development mathematics terms theory defines functions numbers based much simpler sets concept bijection comes define correspondence



since every element paired precisely element vice versa defines bijection
generalize situation define sets size bijection finite sets gives usual definition size tell size infinite sets
consider sets positive integers even positive integers claim definition sets size therefore countably infinite recall prove need exhibit bijection easy using



earlier example every element paired precisely element vice versa hence size example size proper subsets impossible finite sets
likewise ordered pairs natural numbers countably infinite seen following path like picture




cantor pairing function assigns natural number pair natural numbers


resulting mapping like



mapping covers ordered pairs
interestingly treat pair numerator denominator vulgar fraction every positive fraction come distinct number corresponding representation includes also natural numbers since every natural number also fraction conclude exactly many positive rational numbers positive integers true also rational numbers seen
theorem cartesian product finitely many countable sets countable
form triangular mapping recursively generalizes vectors finitely many natural numbers repeatedly mapping first elements natural number example maps maps
sometimes mapping useful want show countably infinite onto another set—and natural numbers example positive rational numbers easily mapped subset pairs natural numbers maps
infinite subsets countably infinite sets fewer elements
theorem every subset countable countable particular every infinite subset countably infinite countably infinite
example prime numbers countable mapping prime number
