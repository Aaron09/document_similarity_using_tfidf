preservationedit
paper foldersedit
ideal photograph storage involves placing photo individual folder constructed buffered acidfree paper7 buffered paper folders especially recommended cases photograph previously mounted onto poor quality material using adhesive lead even acid creation8 store photographs measuring 8x10 inches smaller vertically along longer edge photo buffered paper folder within larger archival label folder relevant information identify rigid nature folder protects photo slumping creasing long packed tightly filled folder larger photos brittle photos stacked flat within archival boxes materials comparable size9
polyester enclosuresedit
stable plastics used photo preservation polyester generate harmful chemical elements capability absorb acids generated photograph polyester sleeves encapsulation praised ability protect photograph humidity environmental pollution slowing reaction item atmosphere true however polyester frequently traps elements next material intended protect especially risky storage environment experiences drastic fluctuations humidity temperature leading ferrotyping sticking photograph plastic7 photographs sleeved encapsulated polyester cannot stored vertically boxes slide next within bending folding archivist write directly onto polyester identify photograph therefore necessary either stack polyester protected photographs horizontally within bind three ring binder stacking photos horizontally within flat greatly reduce ease access binders leave three sides photo exposed effects light10 support photograph evenly sides leading slumping bending within binder plastic used enclosures manufactured frictionless possible prevent scratching photos insertion sleeves unfortunately slippery nature enclosure generates buildup static electricity attracts dust lint particles static attract dust inside sleeve well scratch photograph7 likewise components insertion photo referred slip agents break transfer plastic photograph deposit oily film attracting lint dust time test evaluate longterm effects components photographs addition plastic sleeves develop kinks creases surface scratch away emulsion handling10
handling careedit
best leave photographs lying flat table viewing pick corner even sides hold level every time photograph bends even little break emulsion11 nature enclosing photograph plastic encourages users pick users tend handle plastic enclosed photographs less gently nonenclosed photographs simply feel plastic enclosure makes photo impervious mishandling long photo folder need touch simply remove folder flat table open folder reason researcher archivist need handle actual photo perhaps examine verso writing gloves appears risk oils dirt hands
