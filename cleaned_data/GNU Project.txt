richard stallman announced intent start coding project usenet message september 19839
project first started emacs text editor lisp writing editor commands source level debugger yacccompatible parser generator linker10 system required compiler tools free software also developed june 1987 project accumulated developed free software assembler almost finished portable optimizing compiler editor emacs various unix utilities grep make ld11 initial kernel needed updates
kernel compiler finished able used program development main goal create many applications like unix system able unix programs identical incorporated longer file names file version numbers crashproof file system manifesto written gain support participation others project programmers encouraged take part aspect project interested people could donate funds computer parts even time write code programs project4
origins development aspects project free software general shared detailed narrative emacs help system runs emacs editor command describegnuproject detailed history site
manifestoedit
main article manifesto
manifesto written richard stallman gain support participation project manifesto stallman listed four freedoms essential software users freedom program purpose freedom study mechanics program modify freedom redistribute copies freedom improve change modified versions public use1213 implement freedoms users needed full access code ensure code remained free provide public stallman created general public license allowed software future generations code derived remain free public
philosophy activismedit
main article free software movement
although projects output technical nature launched social ethical political initiative well producing software licenses project published number writings majority authored richard stallman
free softwareedit
project uses software free users copy edit distribute free sense users change software individual needs programmers obtain free software depends software could provided programmer friends internet company programmer works purchase software
fundingedit
proceeds associate members purchases donations support project14
copyleftedit
main article copyleft
copyleft helps maintain free software among programmers copyleft gives legal right everyone edit redistribute programs programs code long distribution terms change result user obtains software legally freedoms rest users
project sometimes differentiate strong weak copyleft weak copyleft programs typically allow distributors link together nonfree programs strong copyleft strictly forbids practice projects output released strong copyleft although released weak copyleft permissive free software licensecitation needed

main article
first goal project create whole freesoftware operating system 1992 project completed major operating system utilities completed proposed operating system kernel hurd release linux kernel started independently linus torvalds 1991 released version 1992 first time possible operating system composed completely free software though linux kernel part project developed using programming tools released free software general public license15
gnulinuxedit
today stable version variant combining packages linux kernel making functional unixlike system project calls gnulinux defining features combination

packages1617 except hurd
packages consist numerous operating system tools utilities shell coreutils compilers libraries etc1617 including library implementation functions specified posix system application program interface posix11819 compiler generate machinecode large variety computerarchitectures20
linux kernel implements program scheduling multitasking device drivers memory management allows system large variety computerarchitectures21 linus torvalds released linux kernel general public license 199222 however part project23242526
nongnu programs various free software packages part project released general public license another fsfapproved free software license

within website list projects laid project specifics type developer able perform task needed certain piece project skill level ranges project project anyone background knowledge programming encouraged support project
packaging tools together linux kernel programs usually called linux distribution distro project calls combination linux kernel gnulinux asks others same27 resulting gnulinux naming controversy
today linux distros combine packages linux kernel contains proprietary binary blobs number proprietary programs
free system distribution guidelinesedit
free system distribution guidelines fsdg system distribution commitment used explain means installable system distribution gnulinux distribution qualify free libre help distribution developers make distributions qualify
mostly includes distributions combination packages linuxlibre kernel modified linux kernel removes binary blobs obfuscated code portions code proprietary licenses consist free software eschewing proprietary software entirely282930 distributions adopted fsdg includes dragora gnulinuxlibre gnewsense parabola gnulinuxlibre trisquel gnulinux ututo others31
fedora project distribution license guidelines used basis fsdg32
strategic projectsedit
also free software foundation high priority projects
mid1990s onward many companies investing free software development free software foundation redirected funds toward legal political support free software development software development point focused maintaining existing projects starting projects acute threat free software community notable projects project compiler collection whose components adopted standard compiler system many unixlike systems
gnomeedit
gnome desktop effort launched project another desktop system becoming popular required users install proprietary software prevent people tempted install project simultaneously launched projects harmony toolkit attempt make free software replacement project successful perceived problem would solved second project gnome tackled issue different angle aimed make replacement dependencies proprietary software harmony project didnt make much progress gnome developed well eventually proprietary component depended released free software33
enterpriseedit
enterprise gnue metaproject started 199634 regarded subproject project gnues goal create free enterpriseclass dataaware applications enterprise resource planners gnue designed collect enterprise software system single location much like gnome project collects desktop software
recognitionedit
2001 project received usenix lifetime achievement award ubiquity breadth quality freely available redistributable modifiable software enabled generation research commercial development35
