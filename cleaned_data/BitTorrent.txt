middle computer acting seed provide file computers peers


bittorrent protocol used reduce server network impact distributing large files rather downloading file single source server bittorrent protocol allows users join swarm hosts upload todownload simultaneously protocol alternative older single source multiple mirror sources technique distributing data work effectively networks lower bandwidth using bittorrent protocol several basic computers home computers replace large servers efficiently distributing files many recipients lower bandwidth usage also helps prevent large spikes internet traffic given area keeping internet speeds higher users general regardless whether bittorrent protocol user wants upload file first creates small torrent descriptor file distribute conventional means email make file available bittorrent node acting seed torrent descriptor file give bittorrent nodes which—acting peers leechers—download connecting seed andor peers diagram right
file distributed divided segments called pieces peer receives piece file becomes source piece peers relieving original seed send piece every computer user wishing copy bittorrent task distributing file shared want entirely possible seed send single copy file eventually distribute unlimited number peers piece protected cryptographic hash contained torrent descriptor6 ensures modification piece reliably detected thus prevents accidental malicious modifications pieces received nodes node starts authentic copy torrent descriptor verify authenticity entire file receives
pieces typically downloaded nonsequentially rearranged correct order bittorrent client monitors pieces needs pieces upload peers pieces size throughout single download example file transmitted pieces forty pieces nature approach download file halted time resumed later date without loss previously downloaded information turn makes bittorrent particularly useful transfer larger files also enables client seek readily available pieces download immediately rather halting download waiting next possibly unavailable piece line typically reduces overall time download peer downloaded file completely becomes additional seed eventual transition peers seeders determines overall health file determined number times file available complete form
distributed nature bittorrent lead floodlike spreading file throughout many peer computer nodes peers join swarm likelihood completely successful download particular node increases relative traditional internet distribution schemes permits significant reduction original distributors hardware bandwidth resource costs distributed downloading protocols general provide redundancy system problems reduce dependence original distributor9 provide sources file generally transient therefore harder trace would block distribution compared situation provided limiting availability file fixed host machine even several
example bittorrent used reduce distribution cost file transmission boinc clientserver system boinc distributed computing application needs updated merely sent user little impact boinc server10
operationedit
bittorrent client program implements bittorrent protocol client capable preparing requesting transmitting type computer file network using protocol peer computer running instance client share file group files peer first creates small file called torrent myfiletorrent file contains metadata files shared tracker computer coordinates file distribution peers want download file must first obtain torrent file connect specified tracker tells peers download pieces file
though ultimately transfer files network bittorrent download differs classic download typical http request example several fundamental ways

bittorrent makes many small data requests different connections different machines classic downloading typically made single connection single machine
bittorrent downloads random rarestfirst11 approach ensures high availability classic downloads sequential

taken together differences allow bittorrent achieve much lower cost content provider much higher redundancy much greater resistance abuse flash crowds regular server software however protection theoretically comes cost downloads take time rise full speed take time enough peer connections established take time node receive sufficient data become effective uploader contrasts regular downloads http server example vulnerable overload abuse rise full speed quickly maintain speed throughout general bittorrents noncontiguous download methods prevented supporting progressive download streaming playback however comments made bram cohen january 200712 suggest streaming torrent downloads soon commonplace supported streaming13 appears result comments january 2011 cohen demonstrated early version bittorrent streaming saying feature projected available summer 201114 2013update bittorrent streaming protocol available beta testing15
creating publishing torrentsedit
peer distributing data file treats file number identically sized pieces usually byte sizes power typically peer creates hash piece using sha1 hash function records torrent file pieces sizes greater reduce size torrent file large payload claimed reduce efficiency protocol16 another peer later receives particular piece hash piece compared recorded hash test piece errorfree6 peers provide complete file called seeders peer providing initial copy called initial seeder exact information contained torrent file depends version bittorrent protocol convention name torrent file suffix torrent torrent files announce section specifies tracker info section containing suggested names files lengths piece length used sha1 hash code piece used clients verify integrity data receive though sha1 shown signs cryptographic weakness bram cohen consider risk enough backward incompatible change example sha317
torrent files typically published websites elsewhere registered least tracker tracker maintains lists clients currently participating torrent6 alternatively trackerless system decentralized tracking every peer acts tracker azureus first18 bittorrent client implement system distributed hash table method alternative incompatible system known mainline released mainline bittorrent client three weeks later though development since 200218 subsequently adopted µtorrent transmission rtorrent ktorrent bitcomet deluge clients
adopted private flag analogous broadcast flag unofficially introduced telling clients restrict decentralized tracking regardless users desires19 flag intentionally placed info section torrent cannot disabled removed without changing identity torrent purpose flag prevent torrents shared clients access tracker flag requested inclusion official specification august 2008 accepted yet20 clients ignored private flag banned many trackers discouraging practice21
downloading torrents sharing filesedit
users find torrent interest browsing means download open bittorrent client client connects trackers specified torrent file receives list peers currently transferring pieces files specified torrent client connects peers obtain various pieces swarm contains initial seeder client connects directly begins request pieces clients incorporate mechanisms optimize download upload rates example download pieces random order increase opportunity exchange data possible peers different pieces file
effectiveness data exchange depends largely policies clients determine send data clients prefer send data peers send data back exchange scheme encourages fair trading strict policies often result suboptimal situations newly joined peers unable receive data dont pieces trade peers good connection exchange data simply neither takes initiative counter effects official bittorrent client program uses mechanism called optimistic unchoking whereby client reserves portion available bandwidth sending pieces random peers necessarily known good partners called preferred peers hopes discovering even better partners ensure newcomers chance join swarm22
although swarming scales well tolerate flash crowds popular content less useful unpopular niche market content peers arriving initial rush might find content unavailable need wait arrival seed order complete downloads seed arrival turn take long happen termed seeder promotion problem since maintaining seeds unpopular content entails high bandwidth administrative costs runs counter goals publishers value bittorrent cheap alternative clientserver approach occurs huge scale measurements shown torrents become unavailable within first month23 strategy adopted many publishers significantly increases availability unpopular content consists bundling multiple files single swarm24 sophisticated solutions also proposed generally crosstorrent mechanisms multiple torrents cooperate better share content25
concernsedit
bittorrent offer users anonymity security possible obtain addresses current possibly previous participants swarm tracker expose users insecure systems attacks22 also rare cases expose users risk sued distributing files without permission copyright holders however ways promote anonymity example oneswarm project layers privacypreserving sharing mechanisms original bittorrent protocol moderate degree anonymity enough keep isps giving user trouble least achieved seedboxes bitport26 putio27 seedr28 download torrent files first companies servers followed direct download user2930 torrents downloaded high degree anonymity using services provide anonymity bittorrent31 also discouraged blocking type connections performance reasons32 unlike designed work bittorrent33 however torrents downloaded within network useful users trying avoid copyright complaints isps maintaining privacy avoiding censorship
private trackers offer users greater degree privacy compared public trackers downside single centralized point failure

bittorrent protocol still development therefore still acquire features enhancements improved efficiency
distributed trackersedit
2005 azureus 2300 known vuze released71 introducing support trackerless torrents system called distributed database system distributed hash table implementation allows client torrents working bittorrent tracker following month bittorrent released version mainline bittorrent client supported alternative implementation popularly known mainline outlined draft website incompatible azureus recent measurement shows users mainline million million daily churn least million72 mainline arguably largest realistic world
current versions official bittorrent client µtorrent bitcomet transmission bitspirit share compatibility mainline implementations based kademlia73 version 3050 azureus also supports mainline addition distributed database optional application plugin74 potentially allows azureusvuze client reach bigger swarm
another idea surfaced vuze virtual torrents idea based distributed tracker approach used describe resource currently used instant messaging implemented using special messaging protocol requires appropriate plugin anatomic another approach uses decentralized network nodes route traffic dynamic trackers bittorrent clients also peer exchange gather peers addition trackers peer exchange checks known peers know peers 3050 release vuze major bittorrent clients compatible peer exchange

throttling encryptionedit
main article bittorrent protocol encryption
since bittorrent makes large proportion total traffic isps chosen throttle slow bittorrent transfers reason methods developed disguise bittorrent traffic attempt thwart efforts86 protocol header encrypt message stream encryptionprotocol encryption msepe features bittorrent clients attempt make bittorrent hard detect throttle november 2015 vuze bitcomet ktorrent transmission deluge µtorrent moopolice halite qbittorrent rtorrent latest official bittorrent client support msepe encryption september 2006 reported software could detect throttle bittorrent traffic masquerading http traffic87
reports august 2007 indicated comcast preventing bittorrent seeding monitoring interfering communication peers protection efforts provided proxying clienttracker traffic encrypted tunnel point outside comcast network88 comcast recently called truce bittorrent intention shaping traffic protocolagnostic manner89 questions ethics legality comcasts behavior renewed debate neutrality united states90 general although encryption make difficult determine shared bittorrent vulnerable traffic analysis thus even msepe possible recognize bittorrent also determine system longer downloading uploading data terminate connection injecting reset flag packets
multitrackeredit
another unofficial feature extension bittorrent metadata format proposed john hoffman91 implemented several indexing websites allows multiple trackers file tracker fails others continue support file transfer implemented several clients bitcomet bittornado bittorrent ktorrent transmission deluge µtorrent rtorrent vuze frostwire trackers placed groups tiers tracker randomly chosen tier tried moving next tier trackers tier fail
torrents multiple trackers decrease time takes download file also consequences

poorly implemented92 clients contact multiple trackers leading overheadtraffic
torrents closed trackers suddenly become downloadable nonmembers connect seed open tracker

decentralized keyword searchedit
even distributed trackers third party still required find specific torrent usually done form hyperlink website content owner indexing websites like isohunt torrentz btdigg torrentus pirate tribler bittorrent client first incorporate decentralized search capabilities
tribler users find torrent files hosted among peers instead centralized index sites adds ability bittorrent protocol using gossip protocol somewhat similar exeem network shut 2005 software includes ability recommend content well dozen downloads tribler software roughly estimate download taste user recommend additional content93
2007 cornell university published paper proposing approach searching peertopeer network inexact strings94 could replace functionality central indexing site year later team implemented system plugin vuze called cubit95 published followup paper reporting success96
somewhat similar facility slightly different approach provided bitcomet client torrent exchange97 feature whenever peers using bitcomet torrent exchange enabled connect exchange lists torrents name infohash torrent share storage torrent files previously downloaded user chose enable sharing torrent exchange thus client builds list torrents shared peers connected current session even maintain list sessions instructed time user search torrent collection list certain torrent sort list categories user chooses download torrent list torrent file automatically searched infohash value network found downloaded querying client create initiate downloading task

legal issuesedit
main article legal issues bittorrent
although protocol perfectly legal problems stem using protocol traffic copyright infringing works much controversy bittorrent trackers bittorrent metafiles store file contents whether publishers bittorrent metafiles violate copyrights linking copyrighted works without authorization copyright holders controversial various jurisdictions pursued legal action websites host bittorrent trackers highprofile examples include closing suprnovaorg torrentspy lokitorrent btjunkie mininova demonoid oinks pink palace pirate torrent website formed swedish group noted legal section website letters replies subject alleged copyright infringements publicly displayed 2006 pirate bays servers sweden raided swedish police allegations mpaa copyright infringement107 however tracker running three days later study used value universal merger comcast envisional examined 10000 torrent swarms managed publicbt active downloaders excluding pornographic unidentifiable content found swarm offered legitimate content108

security problemsedit
bittorrent implementations often communication achieve high bandwidths underlying protocol used allows spoofing source addresses internet traffic used denialofservice attacks users running bittorrent clients amplifiers attack another service111
challengesedit
many challenges however people believe free riders serious issue free riders often referred leeches users download plenty share much less bittorrent collaborative distributed platform content sharing believe important develop solution detect free riders punish trend discouraged112 however otherswho believe important avoid free rider detection punitive actions order protect open access information resources shared bittorrent protocol words ensure individuals lack resources knowledge security measures necessary share their—often limited—bandwidth still retain equal access information
malwareedit
several studies bittorrent indicated exist files containing malware available download bittorrent particular small sample113 indicated executable programs available download contained malware another study114 claims much bittorrent downloads contain zeroday malware bittorrent used distribution mechanism zeroday malware found
biterrant attackedit
sha1 collisions attacker alter execution path executable serving altered chunks victim downloading executable using bittorrent protocol115
criticism biterrant attackedit
despite fact proof concept exists attack succeed limited cases small chunk size 32kb selecting larger chunks 256kb amount resources required find sha1 collision tremendous makes attack virtually impossible
