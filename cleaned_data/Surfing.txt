physics surfingedit
physics surfing involves physical oceanographic properties wave creation surf zone characteristics surfboard surfers interaction water board
wave formationedit
ocean waves defined collection dislocated water parcels undergo cycle forced past normal position restored back normal position19 wind caused ripples eddies form waves gradually gain speed distance fetch waves increase energy speed become longer stronger20 fully developed strongest wave action experiences storms lasting 10hours creates meter wave heights open ocean19
waves created open ocean classified deepwater waves deepwater waves bottom interaction orbits water molecules circular wavelength short relative water depth velocity decays reaching bottom water basin19 deep waves depths greater wavelengths wind forces waves break deep
deepwater waves travel shore become shallow water waves shallow water waves depths less wavelength shallow waves wavelengths long relative water depth elliptical orbitals wave velocity effects entire water basin water interacts bottom approaches shore drag interaction drag interaction pulls bottom wave causes refraction increases height decreases celerity speed wave form crest falls phenomenon happens velocity wave greater velocity bottom wave19
surf zone place convergence multiple waves types creating complex wave patterns wave suitable surfing results maximum speeds meters second speed relative local onshore winds cause waves break20 surf zone shallow water waves carried global winds beach interact local winds make surfing waves2021
different onshore shore wind patterns surf zone create different types waves onshore winds cause random wave breaking patterns suitable experienced surfers2021 light offshore winds create smoother waves strong direct offshore winds cause plunging large barrel waves20 barrel waves large water depth small wave breaks thus breaker intensity force increases wave speed height increase20 shore winds produce nonsurfable conditions flattening weak swell weak swell made surface gravity forces long wavelengths2022

type jettyedit
type jetty occurs tidal delta delta transitioning high tide area shallow water refraction distinctive seabed shapes creates large wave heights24
example type jetty called poles atlantic beach florida atlantic beach known flat waves exceptions major storms however poles larger normal waves 500meter jetty installed south side johns jetty built make deep channel river formed delta poles special area jetty increases wave size surfing comparing preconditions postconditions southern johns river mouth area24
wave size poles depends direction incoming water easterly waters interact jetty create waves larger southern waters 100° southern waves 100° move toward poles waves breaks north southern jetty breaks south jetty allow merging make larger waves easterly waves converge north jetty unite make bigger waves24

currentsedit
currents fast narrow currents caused onshore transport within surf zone successive return water seaward2526 wedge bathymetry makes convenient consistent current 5–10 meters brings surfers “take point” beach24

currents extremely strong narrow extend surf zone deeper water reaching speeds feet second feet second2627 water sediment rich bubble rich moves rapidly26 head current long shore movement currents common beaches mild slopes experience sizable frequent oceanic swell27
vorticity inertia currents studied model vorticity current done scripps institute oceanography found fast current extends away shallow water vorticity current increases width current decreases2728 model also acknowledges friction plays role waves irregular nature28 data sectorscanning doppler sonar scripps institute oceanography found currents jolla lasted several minutes reoccurred four times hour created wedge arch radius 200–400 meters26
surfboardedit
long surfboard feet causes friction water therefore slower smaller lighter board feet longer boards good beginners need help balancing smaller boards good experienced surfers want control maneuverability22
practicing sport surfing surfer paddles past wave break wait wave surfable wave arrives surfer must paddle extremely fast match velocity wave wave accelerate her22
surfer wave speed surfer must quickly stay stay toward front wave become stable prevent falling wave steepens acceleration less toward front toward back physics behind surfing wave involves horizontal acceleration force fsinθ vertical force fcosθmg therefore surfer lean forward gain speed lean back foot brake also increase length ride wave surfer travel parallel wave crest22
