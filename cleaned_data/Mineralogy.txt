main article history mineralogy
early writing mineralogy especially gemstones comes ancient babylonia ancient grecoroman world ancient medieval china sanskrit texts ancient india ancient islamic world4 books subject included naturalis historia pliny elder described many different minerals also explained many properties kitab jawahir book precious stones persian scientist biruni german renaissance specialist georgius agricola wrote works metallica metals 1556 natura fossilium nature rocks 1546 began scientific approach subject systematic scientific studies minerals rocks developed postrenaissance europe4 modern study mineralogy founded principles crystallography origins geometric crystallography traced back mineralogy practiced eighteenth nineteenth centuries microscopic study rock sections invention microscope 17th century4
nicholas steno first observed constancy interfacial angles also known first crystallography quartz crystals 166954 later generalized established experimentally jeanbaptiste romé lislee 17836 rené haüy father modern crystallography showed crystals periodic established orientations crystal faces expressed terms rational numbers later encoded miller indices54 1814 jöns jacob berzelius introduced classification minerals based chemistry rather crystal structure7 william nicol developed nicol prism polarizes light 1827–1828 studying fossilized wood henry clifton sorby showed thin sections minerals could identified optical properties using polarizing microscope54715 james dana published first edition system mineralogy 1837 later edition introduced chemical classification still standard54715 xray diffraction demonstrated laue 1912 developed tool analyzing crystal structure minerals fatherson team william henry bragg william lawrence bragg54
