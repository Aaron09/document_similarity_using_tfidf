gene ontology major bioinformatics initiative unify representation gene gene product attributes across species1 specifically project aims maintain develop controlled vocabulary gene gene product attributes annotate genes gene products assimilate disseminate annotation data provide tools easy access aspects data provided project enable functional interpretation experimental data using example enrichment analysis
part larger classification effort open biomedical ontologies obo2
although gene nomenclature aims maintain develop controlled vocabulary gene gene products gene ontology extends effort using markup language make data genes products also attributes machine readable unified across species whereas gene nomenclature conventions vary biologic taxon

terms ontologyedit
practical view ontology representation something know ontologies consist representation things detectable directly observable relationships things universal standard terminology biology related domains term usages specific species research area even particular research group makes communication sharing data difficult gene ontology project provides ontology defined terms representing gene product properties ontology covers three domains

cellular component parts cell extracellular environment
molecular function elemental activities gene product molecular level binding catalysis
biological process operations sets molecular events defined beginning pertinent functioning integrated living units cells tissues organs organisms

term within ontology term name word string words unique alphanumeric identifier definition cited sources namespace indicating domain belongs terms also synonyms classed exactly equivalent term name broader narrower related references equivalent concepts databases comments term meaning usage ontology structured directed acyclic graph term defined relationships terms domain sometimes domains vocabulary designed speciesneutral includes terms applicable prokaryotes eukaryotes single multicellular organisms
static additions corrections alterations suggested solicited members research annotation communities well directly involved project3 example annotator request specific term represent metabolic pathway section ontology revised help community experts suggested edits reviewed ontology editors implemented appropriate

genome annotation practice capturing data gene product annotations terms ontology members consortium submit annotation integration dissemination website downloaded directly viewed online using amigo addition gene product identifier relevant term annotations following data reference used make annotation journal article evidence code denoting type evidence upon annotation based date creator annotation
evidence code comes controlled vocabulary codes covering manual automated annotation methods example traceable author statement means curator read published scientific paper metadata annotation bears citation paper inferred sequence similarity means human curator reviewed output sequence similarity search verified biologically meaningful annotations automated processes example remapping annotations created using another annotation vocabulary given code inferred electronic annotation april 2010 annotations inferred computationally curators7 annotations checked human consortium considers less reliable includes subset data available online amigo full annotation data sets downloaded website support development annotation consortium provides study camps mentors groups developers
recently many machine learning algorithms designed implemented predict gene ontology annotations89
