anatomists divide bladder into3

broad fundus
body
apex
neck

apex prevvertex directed forward toward upper part pubic symphysis median umbilical ligament continues upward back anterior abdominal wall umbilicus peritoneum carried apex abdominal wall form middle umbilical fold
neck bladder area base trigone surrounds internal urethral orifice leads urethra3 males neck urinary bladder adjacent prostate gland
three openings ureteric orifices internal urethral orifice mark triangular area called trigone bladder openings mucosal flaps front valves preventing backflow urine ureters4 known vesicoureteral reflux ureteric openings raised area tissue called interureteric crest3 makes upper boundary trigone trigone smoothmuscle area forms floor bladder urethra5 area smooth tissue easy flow urine part bladder contrast irregular surface formed rugae
prostate gland lies outside opening urethra middle lobe prostate causes elevation mucous membrane behind internal urethral orifice called uvula urinary bladder uvula enlarge prostate becomes enlarged

detrusor muscleedit
detrusor muscle layer urinary bladder wall made smooth muscle fibers arranged spiral longitudinal circular bundles stretch receptors bladder signal parasympathetic nervous system stimulate muscarinic receptors detrusor contract muscle bladder extended10 encourages bladder expel urine urethra main receptor activated receptor although receptors also involved whilst outnumbering receptors responsive11 main relaxant pathway adenylyl cyclase camp pathway activated adrenergic receptors12 detrusor muscle unusually able change length also contract long time whilst voiding stays relaxed whilst bladder filling12
blood lymphsupplyedit
bladder supplied vesical arteries drained vesical veins13 superior vesical artery supplies blood upper part bladder inferior vesical artery supplies lower part male insted female vaginal artery branches internal iliac arteries13 uterine arteries vaginal arteries also supply blood females13 venous drainage blood supplying bladder begins network small vessels outer back surfaces bladder coalesce pass backwards along lateral ligaments bladder internal iliac veins13
lymph drained bladder begins series networks throughout mucosal muscular serosal layers form three sets vessels near trigone draining bottom bladder draining bladder another draining outer undersurface bladder majority vessels drain external iliac lymph nodes13
nerve supplyedit
bladder receives motor innervation sympathetic fibers arise superior inferior hypogastric plexuses nerves parasympathetic fibers come pelvic splanchnic nerves14
sensation bladder transmitted central nervous system general visceral afferent fibers fibers superior surface follow course sympathetic efferent nerves back fibers inferior portion bladder follow course parasympathetic efferents14
urine exit bladder autonomically controlled internal sphincter male voluntarily controlled external sphincter must opened problems muscles lead incontinence15
developmentedit
human urinary bladder derives urogenital sinus initially continuous allantois upper lower parts bladder develop separately join together around middle part development5 time ureters move mesonephric ducts trigone5 males base bladder lies rectum pubic symphysis superior prostate separated rectum rectovesical pouch females bladder sits inferior uterus anterior vagina thus maximum capacity lower males separated uterus vesicouterine pouch infants young children urinary bladder abdomen even empty16
functionedit
main article urination
urine excreted kidneys collects bladder disposal urination micturition urinary bladder usually holds 300350 urine urine accumulates rugae flatten wall bladder thins stretches allowing bladder store larger amounts urine without significant rise internal pressure17 urination controlled pontine micturition center brainstem18

reptilesedit
reptiles urinogenital ducts anus empty organ called cloaca reptiles midventral wall cloaca open urinary bladder present turtles tortoises well lizards lacking monitor lizard legless lizards absent snakes alligators crocodiles21p
many turtles tortoises lizards proportionally large bladders charles darwin noted galapagos tortoise bladder could store body weight22 adaptations result environments remote islands deserts water scarce23143 desertdwelling reptiles large bladders store longterm reservoir water several months osmoregulation24
turtles accessory urinary bladders located lateral neck urinary bladder dorsal pubis occupying significant portion body cavity25 bladder also usually bilobed left right section right section located liver prevents large stones remaining side left section likely calculi26
amphibiansedit
aquatic semiaquatic amphibians membranous skin allows absorb water directly semiaquatic animals also similarly permeable bladder membrane27 result tend high rates urine production offset high water intake urine dissolved salts urinary bladder assists animals retain salts aquatic amphibian xenopus reabsorb water prevent excessive water influx28 landdwelling amphibians dehydration results reduced urine output29p
amphibian bladder usually highly distensible among landdwelling species frogs salamanders account total body weight29p
fishedit
although gills teleost fish assist elimination ammonia body although fish virtually definition live environment surrounded water still distinct bladder storing waste fluid urinary bladder teleosts permeable water though less true freshwater dwelling species saltwater ones22p fish also organ called swimbladder unrelated urinary bladder except membranous nature loaches pilchards herrings among types fish urinary bladder poorly developed largest fish lack bladder situated front oviducts behind rectum30
mammalsedit
mammals urinary bladder structure begins embryonic cloaca vast majority eventually becomes differentiated dorsal part connected intestine ventral part becomes associated urinogenital passage urinary bladder mammals take place platypus spiny anteater retain cloaca adulthood21
mammalian bladder organ regularly stores hyperosmotic concentration urine therefore relatively impermeable multiple epithelial layers urinary bladder cetaceans whales dolphins proportionally smaller landdwelling mammals31
