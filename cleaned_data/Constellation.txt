1928 international astronomical union ratified recognized modern constellations contiguous boundaries defined right ascension declination therefore given point celestial coordinate system lies modern constellations astronomical naming systems give constellation given celestial object found along designation order convey approximate idea location flamsteed designation bright stars consists number genitive form constellation name

colloquial usage draw sharp distinction constellations many smaller asterisms pattern stars modern accept astronomical constellations employs distinction pleiades hyades asterisms within boundaries constellation taurus another example popular northern asterism known dipper plough comprises seven brightest stars within area defined constellation ursa major southern false cross asterism includes portions constellations carina vela
term circumpolar constellation used constellation particular latitude earth never sets horizon north pole south pole constellations south north celestial equator circumpolar constellations depending definition equatorial constellations include entirely declinations north south6 pass declination range ecliptic zodiac ranging 23½° north celestial equator 23½° south78
although stars constellations appear near usually variety distances away observer since stars also travel along orbits milky constellation outlines change slowly time tens hundreds thousands years familiar outlines gradually become unrecognisable9 astronomers predict past future constellation outlines measuring individual stars common proper motions cpm10 accurate astrometry1112 radial velocities astronomical spectroscopy13

early modern astronomyedit
historically constellations simply divided regions namely northern southern whose origins distinctly different northern skies constellations mostly survived since antiquity whose common names based classical greek legends whose true origins lost7 evidence constellations survived form star charts whose oldest representation appears statue known farnese atlas suggested based star catalogue greek astronomer hipparchus29 southern hemisphere constellations modern inventions created constellations become substitutes ancient constellation argo navis southern constellations become obsolete extended names became foreshortened usable forms musca australis became simply musca7
however early constellations never universally adopted whose popular usage based culture individual nations defining constellation assigned stars also significantly differed size shape whose arbitrary boundaries often lead confusion celestial objects placed constellation boundaries defined international astronomical union 1930 appeared simply encircled areas sky30 today follow officially accepted designated lines right ascension declination based defined benjamin gould epoch 18750 star catalogue known uranometria argentina31
since invention optical telescope astronomers found need catalogue position celestial bodies whose knowledge could used navigational astronomical purposes required improved definitions constellations boundaries changes also assigned stars within constellation first accomplished 1603 johann bayer star atlas uranometria using twentyfour letters greek alphabet32 subsequent star atlases defined celestial cartography lead development towards todays accepted modern constellations
