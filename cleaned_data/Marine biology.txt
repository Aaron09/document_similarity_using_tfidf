aristotle recorded embryo dogfish attached cord kind placenta yolk sac6


study marine biology dates back aristotle 384–322 made many observations life around lesbos laying foundation many future discoveries7 1768 samuel gottlieb gmelin 1744–1774 published historia fucorum first work dedicated marine algae first book marine biology binomial nomenclature linnaeus included elaborate illustrations seaweed marine algae folded leaves89 british naturalist edward forbes 1815–1854 generally regarded founder science marine biology10 pace oceanographic marine biology studies quickly accelerated course 19th century




challenger pioneer expedition 1872–76



observations made first studies marine biology fueled discovery exploration followed time vast amount knowledge gained life exists oceans world many voyages contributed significantly pool knowledge among significant voyages beagle charles darwin came theories evolution formation coral reefs11 another important expedition undertaken challenger findings made unexpectedly high species diversity among fauna stimulating much theorizing population ecologists varieties life could maintained thought hostile environment12 important history marine biology naturalists still limited studies lacked technology would allow adequately examine species lived deep parts oceans

main article marine microorganism
inhabitants largest environment earth microbial marine systems drive changes every global system microbes responsible virtually photosynthesis occurs ocean well cycling carbon nitrogen phosphorus nutrients trace elements15
microscopic life undersea incredibly diverse still poorly understood example role viruses marine ecosystems barely explored even beginning 21st century16
role phytoplankton better understood critical position numerous primary producers earth phytoplankton categorized cyanobacteria also called bluegreen algaebacteria various types algae green brown yellowgreen diatoms dinoflagellates euglenoids coccolithophorids cryptomonads chrysophytes chlorophytes prasinophytes silicoflagellates
zooplankton tend somewhat larger microscopic many protozoa zooplankton including dinoflagellates zooflagellates foraminiferans radiolarians dinoflagellates also phytoplankton distinction plants animals often breaks small organisms zooplankton include cnidarians ctenophores chaetognaths molluscs arthropods urochordates annelids polychaetes many larger animals begin life zooplankton become large enough take familiar forms examples fish larvae stars also called starfish

plants algaeedit
microscopic algae plants provide important habitats life sometimes acting hiding places larval forms larger fish foraging places invertebrates
algal life widespread diverse ocean microscopic photosynthetic algae contribute larger proportion worlds photosynthetic output terrestrial forests combined niche occupied plants land actually occupied macroscopic algae ocean sargassum kelp commonly known seaweeds create kelp forests

green turtle



main article marine reptile
reptiles inhabit frequent include turtles snakes terrapins marine iguana saltwater crocodile extant marine reptiles except snakes oviparous need return land eggs thus species excepting turtles spend lives near land rather ocean despite marine adaptations snakes prefer shallow waters nearby land around islands especially waters somewhat sheltered well near estuaries2324 extinct marine reptiles ichthyosaurs evolved viviparous requirement return land
