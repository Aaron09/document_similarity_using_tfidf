fish evolved creature similar corallike squirt whose larvae resemble primitive fish important ways first ancestors fish kept larval form adulthood squirts today although perhaps reverse case
taxonomy

respiration
also aquatic respiration
gills
fish exchange gases using gills either side pharynx gills consist threadlike structures called filaments filament contains capillary network provides large surface area exchanging oxygen carbon dioxide fish exchange gases pulling oxygenrich water mouths pumping gills fish capillary blood flows opposite direction water causing countercurrent exchange gills push oxygenpoor water openings sides pharynx fish like sharks lampreys possess multiple gill openings however bony fish single gill opening side opening hidden beneath protective bony cover called operculum
juvenile bichirs external gills primitive feature share larval amphibians
breathing

digestion
jaws allow fish wide variety food including plants organisms fish ingest food mouth break esophagus stomach food digested many fish processed fingershaped pouches called pyloric caeca secrete digestive enzymes absorb nutrients organs liver pancreas enzymes various chemicals food moves digestive tract intestine completes process digestion nutrient absorption
excretion
