chloroplasts ˈklɔːrəˌplæsts plɑːsts12 organelles specialized compartments plant algal cells discovery inside plant cells usually credited julius sachs 1832–1897 influential botanist author standard botanical textbooks sometimes called father plant physiology
main role chloroplasts conduct photosynthesis photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures energy sunlight converts stores energystorage molecules nadph freeing oxygen water nadph make organic molecules carbon dioxide process known calvin cycle chloroplasts carry number functions including fatty acid synthesis much amino acid synthesis immune response plants number chloroplasts cell varies unicellular algae plants like arabidopsis wheat
chloroplast type organelle known plastid characterized high concentration chlorophyll plastid types leucoplast chromoplast contain little chlorophyll carry photosynthesis
chloroplasts highly dynamic—they circulate moved around within plant cells occasionally pinch reproduce behavior strongly influenced environmental factors like light color intensity chloroplasts like mitochondria contain thought inherited ancestor—a photosynthetic cyanobacterium engulfed early eukaryotic cell chloroplasts cannot made plant cell must inherited daughter cell cell division
exception amoeboid paulinella chromatophora chloroplasts probably traced back single endosymbiotic event cyanobacterium engulfed eukaryote despite chloroplasts found extremely wide organisms even directly related other—a consequence many secondary even tertiary endosymbiotic events
word chloroplast derived greek words chloros χλωρός means green plastes πλάστης means forms3
