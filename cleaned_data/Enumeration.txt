enumeration combinatoricsedit
main article enumerative combinatorics
combinatorics enumeration means counting determining exact number elements finite sets usually grouped infinite families family sets consisting permutations finite flourishing subareas many branches mathematics concerned enumerating sense objects special kinds instance partition enumeration graph enumeration objective count partitions graphs meet certain conditions
enumeration theoryedit
theory notion enumeration broader sense require enumerated finite
enumeration listingedit
enumeration used ordered list context impose sort ordering structure requirement index make requirements ordering quite order allow great generality natural common prerequisite index wellordered according characterization ordered enumeration defined surjection onto relationship wellordered domain definition natural sense given wellordering index provides unique list next element given partial enumeration
enumeration countable uncountable contextedit
common enumeration theory occurs context infinite sets separated countable case enumeration merely enumeration domain ordinal natural numbers definition also stated follows

surjective mapping








displaystyle mathbb

natural numbers every element image least natural number definition especially suitable questions computability elementary theory

also define differently working finite sets case enumeration defined follows

bijective mapping initial segment natural numbers definition especially suitable combinatorial questions finite sets initial segment cardinality

first definition varies whether mapping also required injective every element image exactly natural number andor allowed partial mapping defined natural numbers applications especially concerned computability differences little importance concerned mere existence enumeration enumeration according liberal definition generally imply enumerations satisfying stricter requirements also exist
enumeration finite sets obviously requires either noninjectivity partiality accepted contexts finite sets appear inevitably present

bijection since every natural number corresponds exactly integer following table gives first values enumeration



























empty finite sets enumerable finite elements select element assign denotes difference select element assign continue process elements assigned natural number

propertiesedit

enumeration domain

ordinal enumerationedit

notions coincide generally theorem wellordered enumerated characterization coincides relabeling generalized listing enumeration also assumes axiom choice sets enumerated coincides relabeling general form enumerations
since theorists work infinite sets arbitrarily large cardinalities default definition among group mathematicians enumeration tends arbitrary αsequence exactly listing elements indeed jechs book common reference theorists enumeration defined exactly therefore order avoid ambiguity term finitely enumerable denumerable denote corresponding types distinguished countable enumerations
enumeration comparison cardinalitiesedit
formally inclusive definition enumeration surjection arbitrary index onto broad context every trivially enumerated identity function onto assume axiom choice variants need wellordering even assume axiom choice need natural wellordering
general definition therefore lends counting notion interested many rather order practice broad meaning enumeration often used compare relative sizes cardinalities different sets works zermelo–fraenkel theory without axiom choice want impose additional restriction enumeration must also injective without repetition since theory existence surjection onto need imply existence injection
enumeration computability theoryedit
computability theory often considers countable enumerations added requirement mapping

natural numbers enumerated must computable enumerated called recursively enumerable computably enumerable contemporary language referring recursion theory formalizations means computable
sense subset natural numbers computably enumerable range computable function context enumerable used mean computably enumerable however definitions characterize distinct classes since uncountably many subsets natural numbers enumerated arbitrary function domain countably many computable functions specific example enumeration computable enumeration complement halting
furthermore characterization illustrates place ordering listing important exists computable enumeration halting lists elements increasing ordering halting would decidable provably false general recursively enumerable weaker condition decidable
