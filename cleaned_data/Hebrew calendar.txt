worked exampleedit
given length year length month fixed described real problem determining calendar year determining number days year modern calendar determined following manner92
rosh hashanah length year determined time week tishrei molad moment average conjunction given tishrei molad certain year length year determined follows
first must determine whether year ordinary leap year position 19year metonic cycle years leap years
secondly must determine number days starting tishrei molad tishrei molad next year calendar descriptions general begins purpose determining rosh hashanah molad occurring noon treated belonging next first deḥiyyah93 months calculated 3​1⁄3s long monlen therefore ordinary year occurs monlen days usually calendar days 31120 noon days similarly leap year occurs monlen days usually days noon 22716​2⁄3 days calculates thus four natural year lengths days

bromberg proposed 353year cycle 4366 months would include leap months along progressively shorter molad interval would keep amended fixed arithmetic hebrew calendar drifting seven millennia96 takes 3​1⁄2 centuries spring equinox drift average ​1⁄19th molad interval earlier hebrew calendar important time unit cancelled simply truncating 19year cycle years omitting years including three leap years sequence essential feature 353year leap cycle years
