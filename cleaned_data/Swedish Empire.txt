infantry shock attack operated follows rear ranks musketeers ordered shoot could miss range roughly meters draw swords battalion resumed attack foremost ranks discharged range roughly meters drawing swords charge began range powerful muskets usually felled many enemy troops demoralising directly volley swedes charged enemy ranks pikes bayonets sabres note pikes used offensive weapon close combat advantage foes weapons thanks range bayonet introduced carolean army 1700–1706 final volley delayed soldiers inside bayonet range
