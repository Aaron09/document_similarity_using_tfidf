usage alphabeta test terminology originated long 1950s probably earlier used similar terminology hardware development test verification product public announcement test verification releasing product manufactured test final test general availability product software became significant part ibms offerings alpha test terminology used denote preannouncement test beta test used show product readiness general availability martin belsky manager ibms earlier software projects claimed invented terminology dropped alphabeta terminology 1960s received fairly wide notice usage beta test refer testing done customers done rather used term field test
stages developmentedit
prealphaedit
prealpha refers activities performed software project formal testing activities include requirements analysis software design software development unit testing typical open source development several types prealpha versions milestone versions include specific sets functions released soon functionality complete
alphaedit
alpha phase release life cycle first phase begin software testing alpha first letter greek alphabet used number phase developers generally test software using whitebox techniques additional validation performed using blackbox graybox techniques another testing team moving blackbox testing inside organization known alpha release1
alpha software unstable could cause crashes data loss alpha software contain features planned final version2 general external availability alpha software uncommon proprietary software open source software often publicly available alpha versions alpha phase usually ends feature freeze indicating features added software time software said feature complete
betaedit
beta test redirects film beta test film
beta named second letter greek alphabet software development phase following alpha software beta stage also known betaware3 beta phase generally begins software feature complete likely contain number known unknown bugs4 software beta phase generally many bugs completed software well speedperformance issues still cause crashes data loss focus beta testing reducing impacts users often incorporating usability testing process delivering beta version users called beta release typically first time software available outside organization developed beta version software often useful demonstrations previews within organization prospective customers developers refer stage preview preview release prototype technical preview technology preview early access software kept perpetual beta features functionality continually added software without establishing final stable release
beta testers people actively report issues beta software usually customers representatives prospective customers organization develops software beta testers tend volunteer services free charge often receive versions product test discounts release version incentives
internet facilitated rapid inexpensive distribution software companies begun take looser approach word beta6 february 2005 zdnet published article recent phenomenon beta version often staying years used production level disparagingly called perpetual beta noted gmail google news example beta long period time expected drop beta status despite fact widely used however google news leave beta january 2006 followed google apps including gmail july 20097 technique allow developer delay offering full support responsibility remaining issues context people even talk perpetual betas signify software meant stay beta state also beta sometimes used indicate something like release candidate form timelimited demo marketing technique8 since introduction windows microsoft longer naming software beta instead using term preview prerelease software since launch windows insider program back 2014 prerelease builds released program known insider preview builds
open closed betaedit
developers release either closed beta also called private beta open beta also called public beta closed beta versions released restricted group individuals user test invitation open beta testers larger group anyone interested private beta could suitable software capable deliver value ready used everyone either scaling issues lack documentation still missing vital features testers report bugs find sometimes suggest additional features think available final version examples major public beta test include following

early customers purchased pioneer edition wordvision word processor 4995 1984 stephen manes wrote brilliant marketing coup bruce james program publishers managed people privilege testing product9
september 2000 boxed version apples public beta operating system released10
microsofts release community technology previews ctps windows vista september 2005 200611
throughout 2009 2011 minecraft public beta
december 2014 owners halo master chief collection xbox able download play beta halo guardians free january 2015 users beta reminded ingame popup release beta could contain glitches encouraged communicate halo series online community

open betas serve dual purpose demonstrating product potential consumers testing among extremely wide user base likely bring light obscure errors much smaller testing team might find
release candidateedit
release candidate also known going silver beta version potential final product ready release unless significant bugs emerge stage product stabilization product features designed coded tested beta cycles known showstopperclass bugs release called code complete development team agrees entirely source code added release could still source code changes defects changes documentation data files peripheral code test cases utilities beta testers privately selected often credited using release candidate though finished product beta testing conducted clients customers location test software users perspective
releaseedit
released software generally known stable release formal term often depends method release physical media online release application
release manufacturing rtmedit
term release manufacturing also known going gold term used software product ready delivered build digitally signed allowing user verify integrity authenticity software purchase copy build known gold master sent mass duplication applicable precedes general availability product released public
typically used certain retail massproduction software contexts—as opposed specialized software production project commercial government production distribution—where software sold part bundle related computer hardware sale typically software related hardware ultimately available sold masspublic basis retail stores indicate software defined quality level ready mass retail distribution could also mean contexts software delivered released client customer installation distribution related hardware user computers machines term define delivery mechanism volume states quality sufficient mass distribution deliverable engineering organization frequently form golden master media used duplication produce image
general availability gaedit




milestones product life cycle general availability life announcement eola last order date endoflife


general availability marketing stage necessary commercialization activities completed software product available purchase depending however language region electronic media availability12 commercialization activities could include security compliance tests well localization worldwide availability time week months cases generally available release declared time needed complete commercialization activities required stage software gone live
release rtwedit
release release means software delivery utilizes internet distribution physical media produced type release mechanism manufacturer releases becoming common internet usage grows
supportedit
supported lifetime software sometimes subjected service releases patches service packs sometimes also called interim releases example microsoft released three major service packs 32bit editions windows service packs 64bit editions service releases contain collection updates fixes enhancements delivered form single installable package also implement features software released expectation regular support classes software generally involve protracted support norm include antivirus suites massively multiplayer online games good example game utilizes process minecraft indie game developed mojang features regular updates featuring content fixes
endoflife edit
also endoflife product abandonware
software longer sold supported product said reached endoflife discontinued retired obsolete user loyalty continue existence time even long platform obsolete—eg atari sinclair spectrum
