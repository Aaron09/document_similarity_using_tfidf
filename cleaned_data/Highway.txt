reducing travel times relative city town streets modern highways limited access grade separation create increased opportunities people travel business trade pleasure also provide trade routes goods modern highways reduce commute travel time additional road capacity also release latent traffic demand accurately predicted planning stage extra traffic lead road becoming congested sooner would otherwise anticipated considering increases vehicle ownership roads allow drivers cars otherwise alternatives sought journey made mean road brings shortterm mitigation traffic congestion
highways created existing communities reduced community cohesion difficult local access consequently property values decreased many cutoff neighborhoods leading decreased housing quality time

main article environmental impacts roads
highways extended linear sources pollution
roadway noise increases operating speed major highways generate noise arterial streets therefore considerable noise health effects expected highway systems noise mitigation strategies exist reduce sound levels nearby sensitive receptors idea highway design could influenced acoustical engineering considerations first arose 19731415
quality issues highways contribute fewer emissions arterials carrying vehicle volumes high constantspeed operation creates emissions reduction compared vehicular flows stops starts however concentrations pollutants near highways higher increased traffic volumes therefore risk exposure elevated levels pollutants highway considerable magnified highways traffic congestion
highways also cause habitat fragmentation encourage urban sprawl allow human intrusion previously untouched areas well counterintuitively increasing congestion increasing number intersections
also reduce public transport indirectly leading greater pollution
highoccupancy vehicle lanes added newerreconstructed highways north america countries around world encourage carpooling masstransit lanes help reduce number cars highway thus reduces pollution traffic congestion promoting carpooling order able lanes however tend require dedicated lanes highway makes difficult construct dense urban areas effective
address habitat fragmentation wildlife crossings become increasingly popular many countries wildlife crossings allow animals safely cross humanmade barriers like highways16
road traffic safetyedit
main article road traffic safety
road traffic safety describes safety performance roads streets methods used reduce harm deaths injuries property damage highway system traffic collisions includes design construction regulation roads vehicles used training drivers roadusers
report published world health organization 2004 estimated people killed injured roads around world year17 leading cause death among children 10–19 years
