life cycle typical moss polytrichum commune


moss lifecycle starts haploid spore germinates produce protonema protonemata either mass threadlike filaments thalloid flat thalluslike massed moss protonemata typically look like thin green felt grow damp soil tree bark rocks concrete almost reasonably stable surface transitory stage life moss protonema grows gametophore gametebearer structurally differentiated stems leaves single protonemata develop several gametophore shoots resulting clump moss
tips gametophore stems branches develop organs mosses female organs known archegonia sing archegonium protected group modified leaves known perichaetum plural perichaeta archegonia small flaskshaped clumps cells open neck venter male sperm swim male organs known antheridia sing antheridium enclosed modified leaves called perigonium perigonia surrounding leaves mosses form splash allowing sperm contained splashed neighboring stalks falling water droplets
mosses either dioicous compare dioecious seed plants monoicous compare monoecious dioicous mosses male female organs borne different gametophyte plants monoicous also called autoicous mosses borne plant presence water sperm antheridia swim archegonia fertilisation occurs leading production diploid sporophyte sperm mosses biflagellate flagellae propulsion since sperm must swim archegonium fertilisation cannot occur without water species example mnium hornum several species polytrichum keep antheridia called splash cups bowllike structures shoot tips propel sperm several decimeters water droplets increasing fertilization distance7
fertilisation immature sporophyte pushes archegonial venter takes quarter half year sporophyte mature sporophyte body comprises long stalk called seta capsule capped called operculum capsule operculum turn sheathed haploid calyptra remains archegonial venter calyptra usually falls capsule mature within capsule sporeproducing cells undergo meiosis form haploid spores upon cycle start mouth capsule usually ringed teeth called peristome absent mosses
mosses rely wind disperse spores genus sphagnum spores projected 10–20 ground compressed contained capsules spores accelerated 36000 times earths gravitational acceleration

decreasing availability water drainage
increasing direct sunlight
increasing number resources available competitive plants like grasses
increasing soil application lime
heavy traffic manually disturbing moss rake
application chemicals ferrous sulfate lawns bleach solid surfaces
