early proposals panamaedit
earliest mention canal across isthmus panama dates back 1534 charles holy roman emperor king spain ordered survey route americas would ease voyage ships traveling spain peru route would given spanish military advantage portuguese4
1668 english physician philosopher thomas browne speculated encyclopaedic endeavour pseudodoxia epidemica isthmus others spade policy would permit panama america worthy attempt miles would open shorter unto east indies china5
1788 thomas jefferson suggested spanish create since would less treacherous route going around southern south america tropical ocean currents would naturally widen thereafter6 expedition 1788 1793 alessandro malaspina outlined plans construction7
given strategic location panama potential offered narrow isthmus separating great oceans trade links area attempted years illfated darien scheme launched kingdom scotland 1698 overland trade route generally inhospitable conditions thwarted effort abandoned april 17008
late 18th early 19th centuries number canals built success erie canal united states collapse spanish empire latin america surge american interest building interoceanic canal beginning 1826 officials began negotiations gran colombia presentday colombia venezuela ecuador panama hoping gain concession building canal jealous newly obtained independence fearing would dominated american presence president simon bolivar granadans officials declined american offers nation politically unstable panama rebelled several times 19th century
another effort made 1843 according york daily tribune august 1843 contract entered barings london republic granada construction canal across isthmus darien isthmus panama referred atlantic pacific canal wholly british endeavor expected completed five years plan never carried nearly time ideas floated including canal andor railroad across mexicos isthmus tehuantepec nothing came plan either9
1846 mallarino–bidlack treaty negotiated granada granted united states transit rights right intervene militarily isthmus 1849 discovery gold california created great interest crossing atlantic pacific oceans panama railway built united states cross isthmus opened 1855 overland link became vital piece western hemisphere infrastructure greatly facilitating trade largely determining later canal route
allwater route oceans still seen ideal solution 1855 william kennish manxborn engineer working united states government surveyed isthmus issued report route proposed panama canal10 report published book entitled practicability importance ship canal connect atlantic pacific oceans11
1877 armand reclus officer french navy lucien napoléon bonaparte wyse engineers surveyed route published french proposal canal12 french success building suez canal lengthy project encouraged planning cross isthmus13
french construction attempts 1881–1894edit

first attempt construct canal colombias province panama began january 1881 project inspired diplomat ferdinand lesseps able raise considerable finance france result huge profits generated successful construction suez canal14 although panama canal would eventually long suez canal former would prove engineering challenge tropical rain forests climate need canal locks lack ancient route follow
lesseps wanted sealevel canal suez visited site times season lasts four months year15 totally unprepared rainy season chagres river canal started became raging torrent rising meters feet dense jungle alive venomous snakes insects spiders worst aspect yellow fever malaria tropical diseases killed thousands workers 1884 death rate month16 public health measures ineffective role mosquito disease vector unknown conditions downplayed france avoid recruitment problems17 high mortality rate made difficult maintain experienced workforce
workers continually widen main mountain culebra reduce angles slopes minimize landslides canal18 steam shovels used construction canal purchased city industrial works business owned william clements city michigan19 mechanical electrical equipment limited capabilities steel equipment rusted rapidly climate20
france lesseps kept investment supply workers flowing long obvious targets eventually money french effort went bankrupt 1889 reportedly spending us287000000 losing estimated 22000 lives disease accidents wiping savings 800000 investors1721 work suspended ensuing scandal known panama affair various deemed responsible prosecuted including gustave eiffel22 lesseps charles found guilty misappropriation funds sentenced five years imprisonment though later overturned father never imprisoned17

time president senate united states interested establishing canal across isthmus favoring canal across nicaragua others advocating purchase french interests panama bunauvarilla seeking american involvement asked million accepted million face nicaraguan option june 1902 senate voted favor pursuing panamanian option provided necessary rights could obtained spooner act24
january 1903 hay–herrán treaty signed united states secretary state john colombian chargé tomás herrán million annual payment would granted united states renewable lease perpetuity colombia land proposed canal25 treaty ratified senate march 1903 senate colombia ratify bunauvarilla told president theodore roosevelt possible revolt panamanian rebels aimed separate colombia hoped united states would support rebels troops money roosevelt changed tactics based part mallarino–bidlack treaty 1846 actively supported separation panama colombia shortly recognizing panama signed treaty panamanian government similar terms hay–herrán treaty26
november 1903 warships blocked lanes possible colombian troop movements route rebellion panama declared independence november 1903 united states quickly recognized nation27 november 1903 philippe bunauvarilla panamas ambassador united states signed hay–bunauvarilla treaty granting rights united states build indefinitely administer panama canal zone defenses sometimes misinterpreted 99year lease misleading wording included article agreement28 almost immediately treaty condemned many panamanians infringement countrys national sovereignty2930 would later become contentious diplomatic issue among colombia panama united states
president roosevelt famously stated took isthmus started canal left congress debate canal debate several parties united states called colombia york times called support given united states bunauvarilla sordid conquest york evening post called vulgar mercenary venture often cited classic example gunboat diplomacy latin america best illustration roosevelt meant african adage speak softly carry stick revolution 1903 republic panama became protectorate 193931
thus 1904 united states purchased french equipment excavations including panama railroad us40 million million related excavations completed primarily gaillard called culebra valued cubic yard32 united states also paid country panama million 250000 payment following year
1921 colombia united states entered thomsonurrutia treaty united states agreed colombia million million upon ratification four5 million annual payments grant colombia special privileges canal zone return colombia recognized panama independent nation
