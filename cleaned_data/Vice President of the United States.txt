ultimate goal vice presidential candidate selection help hurt partys chances getting elected nonetheless several vice presidential selections controversial 1984 democratic nominee walter mondales groundbreaking choice geraldine ferraro running mate first woman history nominated vice president major political party became drag ticket repeated questions husbands finances selection whose positive traits make presidential candidate look less favorable comparison cause presidential candidates judgment questioned often backfire 1988 democratic candidate michael dukakis chose experienced texas senator lloyd bentsen bentsen considered seasoned statesman federal politics somewhat overshadowed dukakis questions quayles experience raised 1988 presidential campaign george bush bushquayle ticket still handily james stockdale choice thirdparty candidate ross perot 1992 seen unqualified many stockdale little preparation vice presidential debate perotstockdale ticket still vote 2008 republican john mccain chose sarah palin running mate primary rivals andor campaign surrogates mitt romney ridge surprise move would hoped draw women voters disappointed hillary clintons defeat democratic presidential primaries mccain camp palins selection soon came seen negative mccain several controversies gubernatorial tenure highlighted press feuding mccain campaign chairman steve schmidt perception continued grow throughout campaign especially interviews katie couric concerns fitness presidency29
