logic logical connective also called logical operator sentential connective sentential operator symbol word used connect sentences either formal natural language grammatically valid value compound sentence produced depends original sentences meaning connective
common logical connectives binary connectives also called dyadic connectives join sentences thought functions operands also commonly negation considered unary connective
logical connectives along quantifiers main types logical constants used formal systems propositional logic predicate logic semantics logical connective often always presented truth function

grammar natural languages sentences joined grammatical conjunction form grammatically compound sentence grammatical conjunctions truth functions example consider following sentences

jack went hill
jill went hill
jack went hill jill went hill
jack went hill jill went hill

words grammatical conjunctions joining sentences form compound sentences logical connective since truth completely determined would make sense affirm deny however logical connective since would quite reasonable affirm deny perhaps jill went hill fetch pail water jack gone hill
various english words word pairs express logical connectives synonymous examples
