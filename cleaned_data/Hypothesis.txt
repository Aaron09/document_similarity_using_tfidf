useful hypothesis enable predictions reasoning including deductive reasoning might predict outcome experiment laboratory setting observation phenomenon nature prediction also invoke statistics talk probabilities karl popper following others argued hypothesis must falsifiable cannot regard proposition theory scientific admit possibility shown false philosophers science rejected criterion falsifiability supplemented criteria verifiability verificationism coherence confirmation holism scientific method involves experimentation test ability hypothesis adequately answer question investigation contrast unfettered observation likely raise unexplained issues open questions science would formulation crucial experiment test hypothesis thought experiment might also used test hypothesis well
framing hypothesis investigator must currently know outcome test remains reasonably continuing investigation cases experiment test study potentially increase probability showing truth hypothesis11pp1749–50 researcher already knows outcome counts consequence researcher already considered formulating hypothesis cannot assess predictions observation experience hypothesis needs tested others providing observations example technology theory might make necessary experiments feasible

statistical hypothesis testingedit

possible correlation similar relation phenomena investigated whether proposed remedy effective treating disease hypothesis relation exists cannot examined might examine proposed nature investigation tested remedy shows effect cases necessarily falsify hypothesis instead statistical tests used determine likely overall effect would observed hypothesized relation exist likelihood sufficiently small less existence relation assumed otherwise observed effect pure chance
statistical hypothesis testing hypotheses compared called null hypothesis alternative hypothesis null hypothesis hypothesis states relation phenomena whose relation investigation least form given alternative hypothesis alternative hypothesis name suggests alternative null hypothesis states kind relation alternative hypothesis take several forms depending nature hypothesized relation particular twosided example effect unknown direction onesided direction hypothesized relation positive negative fixed advance23
conventional significance levels testing hypotheses acceptable probabilities wrongly rejecting true null hypothesis whether null hypothesis rejected alternative hypothesis accepted must determined advance observations collected inspected criteria determined later data tested already known test invalid24
