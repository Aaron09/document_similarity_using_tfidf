fertilizers enhance growth plants goal ways traditional additives provide nutrients second mode fertilizers enhance effectiveness soil modifying water retention aeration article like many fertilizers emphasises nutritional aspect fertilizers typically provide varying proportions1

three main macronutrients

nitrogen leaf growth
phosphorus development roots flowers seeds fruit
potassium strong stem growth movement water plants promotion flowering fruiting


three secondary macronutrients calcium magnesium sulfur
micronutrients copper iron manganese molybdenum zinc boron occasional significance silicon cobalt vanadium plus rare mineral catalysts

nutrients required healthy plant life classified according elements elements used fertilizers instead compounds containing elements basis fertilizers macronutrients consumed larger quantities present plant tissue quantities matter moisture basis plants made four main elements hydrogen oxygen carbon nitrogen carbon hydrogen oxygen widely available water carbon dioxide although nitrogen makes atmosphere form unavailable plants nitrogen important fertilizer since nitrogen present proteins components chlorophyll nutritious plants nitrogen must made available fixed form bacteria host plants notably legumes atmospheric nitrogen converting ammonia phosphate required production main energy carrier cells well certain lipids
