taxonomy namingedit
conifer latin word compound conus cone ferre bear meaning bears cones
division name pinophyta conforms rules international code nomenclature algae fungi plants state article names higher taxa plants rank family either formed name included family usually common andor representative case pinaceae pine family descriptive descriptive name widespread conifers whatever rank chosen coniferae
according possible name formed replacing termination aceae name included family case preferably pinaceae appropriate termination case division ‑ophyta alternatively descriptive botanical names also used rank family allowed
means conifers considered division called pinophyta coniferae class called pinopsida coniferae order called pinales coniferae coniferales
conifers largest economically important component group gymnosperms nevertheless comprise four groups division pinophyta consists class pinopsida includes living fossil taxa subdivision living conifers orders proposed time time commonly seen past split orders taxales taxaceae pinales rest recent research sequences suggests interpretation leaves pinales without taxales paraphyletic latter order longer considered distinct accurate subdivision would split class three orders pinales containing pinaceae araucariales containing araucariaceae podocarpaceae cupressales containing remaining families including taxaceae significant support split majority opinion preferring retention families within single order pinales despite antiquity diverse morphology

reproductionedit
main article conifer cone
conifers monoecious subdioecious dioecious windpollinated conifer seeds develop inside protective cone called strobilus cones take four months three years reach maturity vary size long
pinaceae araucariaceae sciadopityaceae cupressaceae cones woody mature scales usually spread open allowing seeds fall dispersed wind firs cedars cones disintegrate release seeds others pines produce pine nuts nutlike seeds dispersed birds mainly nutcrackers jays break specially adapted softer cones ripe cones remain plant varied amount time falling ground fireadapted pines seeds stored closed cones 60–80 years released fire kills parent tree

male cones structures called microsporangia produce yellowish pollen meiosis pollen released carried wind female cones pollen grains living pinophyte species produce pollen tubes much like angiosperms gymnosperm male gametophytes pollen grains carried wind female cone drawn tiny opening ovule called micropyle within ovule pollengermination occurs pollen tube seeks female gametophyte successful fertilization occurs resulting zygote develops embryo along surrounding integument becomes seed eventually seed fall ground conditions permit grow plant
forestry terminology flowering plants commonly though inaccurately applied conebearing trees well male cone unfertilized female cone called male flower female flower respectively fertilization female cone termed fruit undergoes ripening maturation
