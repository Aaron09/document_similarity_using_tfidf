specialized termsedit
stems often specialized storage asexual reproduction protection photosynthesis including following

acaulescent used describe stems plants appear stemless actually stems extremely short leaves appearing rise directly ground viola species
arborescent tree like woody stems normally single trunk
branched aerial stems described branched unbranched
embryonic shoot immature stem
bulb short vertical underground stem fleshy storage leaves attached onion daffodil tulip bulbs often function reproduction splitting form bulbs producing small bulbs termed bulblets bulbs combination stem leaves better considered leaves leaves make greater part
caespitose stems grow tangled mass clump growing mats
cladode including phylloclade flattened stem appears moreorless leaf like specialized photosynthesis2 cactus pads
climbing stems cling wrap around plants structures
corm short enlarged underground storage stem taro crocus gladiolus





decumbent stem cucurbita maxima



decumbent stems flat ground turn upwards ends
fruticose stems grow shrublike woody like habit
herbaceous woody growing season
pedicel stems serve stalk individual flower inflorescence infrutescence
peduncle stem supports inflorescence
prickle sharpened extension stems outer layers roses
pseudostem false stem made rolled bases leaves tall banana
rhizome horizontal underground stem functions mainly reproduction also storage ferns iris
runner plant part type stolon horizontally growing ground rooting nodes aids reproduction garden strawberry chlorophytum comosum
scape stem holds flowers comes ground normal leaves hosta lily iris garlic
stolon horizontal stem produces rooted plantlets nodes ends forming near surface ground
thorn modified stem sharpened point

stem structureedit




flax stem crosssection showing locations underlying tissues epidermis cortex bast fibres phloem xylem pith


also stele biology
stem usually consist three tissues dermal tissue ground tissue vascular tissue dermal tissue covers outer surface stem usually functions waterproof protect control exchange ground tissue usually consists mainly parenchyma cells fills around vascular tissue sometimes functions photosynthesis vascular tissue provides long distance transport structural support ground tissue lost woody stems dermal tissue aquatic plants stems lack waterproofing found aerial stems arrangement vascular tissues varies widely among plant species
dicot stemsedit
dicot stems primary growth pith center vascular bundles forming distinct ring visible stem viewed cross section outside stem covered epidermis covered waterproof cuticle epidermis also contain stomata exchange multicellular stem hairs called trichomes cortex consisting hypodermis collenchyma cells endodermis starch containing cells present pericycle vascular bundles
woody dicots many nonwoody dicots secondary growth originating lateral secondary meristems vascular cambium cork cambium phellogen vascular cambium forms xylem phloem vascular bundles connects form continuous cylinder vascular cambium cells divide produce secondary xylem inside secondary phloem outside stem increases diameter production secondary xylem secondary phloem cortex epidermis eventually destroyed cortex destroyed cork cambium develops cork cambium divides produce waterproof cork cells externally sometimes phelloderm cells internally three tissues form periderm replaces epidermis function areas loosely packed cells periderm function exchange called lenticels
secondary xylem commercially important wood seasonal variation growth vascular cambium creates yearly tree rings temperate climates tree rings basis dendrochronology dates wooden objects associated artifacts dendroclimatology tree rings record past climates aerial stem adult tree called trunk dead usually darker inner wood large diameter trunk termed heartwood result tylosis outer living wood termed sapwood
monocot stemsedit




stems roystonea regia palms showing characteristic bulge leaf scars fibrous roots kolkata india


vascular bundles present throughout monocot stem although concentrated towards outside differs dicot stem ring vascular bundles often none center shoot apex monocot stems elongated leaf sheathes grow around protecting true extent almost monocots monocots rarely produce secondary growth therefore seldom woody palms bamboo notable exceptions however many monocot stems increase diameter anomalous secondary growth
gymnosperm stemsedit




trunk redwood tree stem






tasmanian tree fern


gymnosperms woody plants stems similar structure woody dicots except gymnosperms produce tracheids xylem vessels found dicots gymnosperm wood also often contains resin ducts woody dicots called hardwoods maple walnut contrast softwoods gymnosperms pine spruce
fern stemsedit
ferns rhizomes vertical stem exception tree ferns vertical stems metres stem anatomy ferns complicated dicots fern stems often leaf gaps cross section leaf vascular tissue branches frond cross section vascular tissue form complete cylinder leaf occurs fern stems solenosteles dictyosteles variations many fern stems phloem tissue sides xylem crosssection
