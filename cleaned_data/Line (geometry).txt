notion line straight line introduced ancient mathematicians represent straight objects curvature negligible width depth lines idealization objects 17th century lines defined manner straight curved line first species quantity dimension namely length without width depth nothing else flow point leave imaginary moving vestige length exempt width straight line equally extended points1
euclid described line breadthless length lies equally respect points introduced several postulates basic unprovable properties constructed geometry called euclidean geometry avoid confusion geometries introduced since 19th century noneuclidean projective affine geometry
modern mathematics given multitude geometries concept line closely tied geometry described instance analytic geometry line plane often defined points whose coordinates satisfy given linear equation abstract setting incidence geometry line independent object distinct points

rank less particular three points plane matrix square points collinear determinant zero
equivalently three points plane points collinear slope pair points equals slope pair points case slope remaining pair points equal slopes extension points plane collinear pairs points pairwise slopes
euclidean geometry euclidean distance points used express collinearity three points by1011

points collinear implies

however notions distance manhattan distance property true
geometries concept line primitive notion case synthetic geometries methods determining collinearity needed
types linesedit
sense12 lines euclidean geometry equal without coordinates tell apart another however lines play special roles respect objects geometry divided types according relationship instance respect conic circle ellipse parabola hyperbola lines

tangent lines touch conic single point
secant lines intersect conic points pass interior
exterior lines meet conic point euclidean plane
directrix whose distance point helps establish whether point conic

context determining parallelism euclidean geometry transversal line intersects lines parallel
general algebraic curves lines could also

isecant lines meeting curve points counted without multiplicity
asymptotes curve approaches arbitrarily closely without touching

respect triangles

euler line
simson lines
central lines

convex quadrilateral parallel sides newton line line connects midpoints diagonals
hexagon vertices lying conic pascal line special case conic pair lines pappus line
parallel lines lines plane never cross intersecting lines share single point common coincidental lines coincide other—every point either also
perpendicular lines lines intersect right angles
threedimensional space skew lines lines plane thus intersect
projective geometryedit
information projective geometry
many models projective geometry representation line rarely conforms notion straight curve visualised euclidean geometry elliptic geometry typical example this13 spherical representation elliptic geometry lines represented great circles sphere diametrically opposite points identified different model elliptic geometry lines represented euclidean planes passing origin even though representations visually distinct satisfy properties points determining unique line make suitable representations lines geometry
extensionsedit
rayedit
given line point consider decomposing line parts part called halfline point called initial point point considered member ray14 intuitively consists points line passing proceeding indefinitely starting direction along line however order concept proofs precise definition required
given distinct points determine unique initial point points define unique line consists points including points line times also expressed points point line determined initial point determined determine another initial point respect called opposite



thus would different points define line decomposition line disjoint union open segment rays point drawn diagram left line opposite rays since different initial points
euclidean geometry rays common endpoint form angle
definition depends upon notion betweenness points line follows rays exist geometries notion exists typically euclidean geometry affine geometry ordered field hand rays exist projective geometry geometry nonordered field like complex numbers finite field
topology space continuous embedding used define important concept space
line segmentedit
