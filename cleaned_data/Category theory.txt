basic conceptsedit
categories represent abstraction mathematical concepts many areas mathematics formalised category theory categories hence category theory uses abstraction make possible state prove many intricate subtle mathematical results fields much simpler way2
basic example category category sets objects sets arrows functions another however objects category need sets arrows need functions formalising mathematical concept meets basic conditions behaviour objects arrows valid category—and results category theory apply
arrows category theory often said represent process connecting objects many cases structurepreserving transformation connecting objects however many applications much abstract concepts represented objects morphisms important property arrows composed words arranged sequence form arrow
applications categoriesedit

study categories attempt axiomatically capture commonly found various classes related mathematical structures relating structurepreserving functions systematic study category theory allows prove general results types mathematical structures axioms category
consider following example class groups consists objects group structure proceed prove theorems groups making logical deductions axioms defining groups example immediately proven axioms identity element group unique
instead focusing merely individual objects groups possessing given structure category theory emphasizes morphisms structurepreserving mappings objects studying morphisms able learn structure objects case groups morphisms group homomorphisms group homomorphism groups preserves group structure precise sense informally process taking group another carries along information structure first group second group study group homomorphisms provides tool studying general properties groups consequences group axioms
similar type investigation occurs many mathematical theories study continuous maps morphisms topological spaces topology associated category called study smooth functions morphisms manifold theory
categories arise structure preserving functions however standard example category homotopies pointed topological spaces
axiomatizes relations instead functions obtains theory allegories
functorsedit
main article functor
also adjoint functors motivation
category type mathematical structure look processes preserve structure sense process called functor
diagram chasing visual method arguing abstract arrows joined diagrams functors represented arrows categories subject specific defining commutativity conditions functors define construct categorical diagrams sequences mitchell 1965 functor associates every object category object another category every morphism first category morphism second
fact done define category categories functors objects categories morphisms categories functors

main articles category mathematics morphism
categoriesedit
category consists following three mathematical entities

class whose elements called objects
class homc whose elements called morphisms maps arrows morphism source object target object
expression would verbally stated morphism
expression homa alternatively expressed homca mora denotes homclass morphisms
binary operation called composition morphisms three objects homb homa homa composition written governed axioms

associativity
identity every object exists morphism called identity morphism every morphism






axioms proved exactly identity morphism every object authors deviate definition given identifying object identity morphism



morphismsedit
relations among morphisms often depicted using commutative diagrams points corners representing objects arrows representing morphisms
morphisms following properties morphism

monomorphism monic implies morphisms
epimorphism epic implies morphisms
bimorphism epic monic
isomorphism exists morphism
endomorphism enda denotes class endomorphisms
automorphism endomorphism isomorphism auta denotes class automorphisms
retraction right inverse exists exists morphism
section left inverse exists exists morphism

every retraction epimorphism every section monomorphism furthermore following three statements equivalent

monomorphism retraction
epimorphism section
isomorphism

functorsedit
main article functor
functors structurepreserving maps categories thought morphisms category small categories
covariant functor category category written consists

object object
morphism morphism

following properties hold

every object
morphisms

contravariant functor like covariant functor except turns morphisms around reverses arrows specifically every morphism must assigned morphism words contravariant functor acts covariant functor opposite category
natural transformationsedit
main article natural transformation
natural transformation relation functors functors often describe natural constructions natural transformations describe natural homomorphisms constructions sometimes quite different constructions yield result expressed natural isomorphism functors
covariant functors categories natural transformation associates every object morphism every morphism means following diagram commutative



functors called naturally isomorphic exists natural transformation isomorphism every object

functor category objects functors morphisms natural transformations functors yoneda lemma famous basic results category theory describes representable functors functor categories
duality every statement theorem definition category theory dual essentially obtained reversing arrows statement true category dual true dual category duality transparent level category theory often obscured applications lead surprising relationships
adjoint functors functor left right adjoint another functor maps opposite direction pair adjoint functors typically arises construction defined universal property seen abstract powerful view universal properties

higherdimensional categoriesedit
main article higher category theory
many concepts especially equivalence categories adjoint functor pairs functor categories situated context higherdimensional categories briefly consider morphism objects process taking object another higherdimensional categories allow profitably generalize considering higherdimensional processes
example strict 2category category together morphisms morphisms processes allow transform morphism another compose bimorphisms horizontally vertically require 2dimensional exchange hold relating composition laws context standard example 2category small categories example bimorphisms morphisms simply natural transformations morphisms usual sense another basic example consider 2category single object essentially monoidal categories bicategories weaker notion 2dimensional categories composition morphisms strictly associative associative isomorphism
process extended natural numbers called ncategories even notion ωcategory corresponding ordinal number
