modern structural concrete differs roman concrete important details first consistency fluid homogeneous allowing poured forms rather requiring handlayering together placement aggregate roman practice often consisted rubble second integral reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength tension whereas roman concrete could depend upon strength concrete bonding resist tension15

longterm durability roman concrete structures found pyroclastic volcanic rock whereby crystallization strätlingite coalescence calcium–aluminumsilicate–hydrate cementing binder helped give concrete greater degree fracture resistance even seismically active environments16 roman concrete significantly resistant erosion seawater modern concrete used pyroclastic materials react seawater form altobermorite crystals time1718
