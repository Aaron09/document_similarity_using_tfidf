iucn definitionedit
international union conservation nature iucn foremost authority threatened species treats threatened species single category group three categories depending degree threatened

vulnerable species
endangered species
critically endangered species

lessthanthreatened categories near threatened least concern longer assigned category conservation dependent species evaluated sufficient data data deficient also considered threatened iucn




three categories threatened species iucn list


although threatened vulnerable used interchangeably discussing iucn categories term threatened generally used refer three categories critically endangered endangered vulnerable vulnerable used refer least risk three categories used interchangeably contexts however vulnerable species threatened species vulnerable category threatened species atrisk categories threatened species namely endangered critically endangered must definition also qualify vulnerable species threatened species also considered vulnerable
threatened species also referred redlisted species listed iucn list threatened species
subspecies populations stocks also classified threatened
united states definitionedit




threatened relation endangered


endangered species united states threatened defined species likely become endangered species within foreseeable future throughout significant portion range2 less protected protected categories checkerspot butterfly euphydryas editha bayensis example threatened subspecies protected
within state wildlife agencies authority manage species considered endangered threatened within state within states therefore included national list endangered threatened species example trumpeter swan cygnus buccinator threatened state minnesota large populations still remain canada alaska3

australian definitionedit
commonwealth australia legislation categorising protecting endangered species namely environment protection biodiversity conservation 1999 known short epbc categories4 extinct extinct wild critically endangered endangered vulnerable conservation dependent defined section could summarised

extinct reasonable doubt last member species died
extinct wild known survive cultivation despite exhaustive surveys seen wild
critically endangered extremely high risk extinction wild immediate future
endangered high risk extinction wild near future
vulnerable high risk extinction wild mediumterm future
conservation dependent focus specific conservation program without species would enter categories

epbc also recognises protects threatened ecosystems plant communities ramsar convention wetlands used migratory birds
individual states territories australia bound epbc also legislation gives protection certain species example western australias wildlife conservation 1950 species lewins rail lewinia pectoralis listed threatened species epbc recognised threatened individual states territories
