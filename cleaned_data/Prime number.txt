definition examples
natural number called prime number prime exactly positive divisors number itself1 natural numbers greater prime called composite




number prime items placed equalsize columns among ways items cannot placed several equalsize columns item without extra items leftover remainder therefore number prime


example among numbers numbers prime numbers prime excluded prime number reasons explained prime number since natural numbers dividing prime numbers divide evenly composite since number divides evenly addition prime divide evenly divisible therefore prime
even number greater prime definition even number least three distinct divisors namely accordingly term prime refers prime number greater similarly written usual decimal system prime numbers larger would since even numbers multiples numbers ending multiples
natural number divide without remainder therefore condition prime also restated number prime greater none



divides without remainder another number prime cannot written product integers larger
