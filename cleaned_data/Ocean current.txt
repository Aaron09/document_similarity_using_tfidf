ocean current seasonal directed movement seawater generated forces acting upon mean flow breaking waves wind coriolis effect cabbeling temperature salinity differences tides caused gravitational pull moon depth contours shoreline configurations interactions currents influence currents direction strength therefore ocean currents primarily horizontal water movements
ocean currents flow great distances together create global conveyor belt plays dominant role determining climate many earth’s regions specifically ocean currents influence temperature regions travel example warm currents traveling along temperate coasts increase temperature area warming breezes blow perhaps striking example gulf stream makes northwest europe much temperate region latitude another example lima peru climate cooler subtropical tropical latitudes area located effect humboldt current

horizontal vertical currents also exist pycnocline oceans deeper waters movement water differences density function water temperature salinity called thermohaline circulation ripple marks sediments scour lines erosion rocky outcrops deepocean floors evidence relatively strong localized bottom currents exist currents move rapidly centimeters inches second
currents strongly influenced bottom topography since dense bottom water must forcefully flow around depressions projections seafloor thus sometimes called contour currents bottom currents generally move equatorward near western boundaries ocean basins western boundary surface currents deepwater masses capable moving water speeds comparable winddriven surface currents water currents move meters however even slow speed coriolis effect modifies pattern flow
