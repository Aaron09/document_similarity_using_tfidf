data structureedit
file formatsedit
database published text files list rules zone transitions humanreadable format text files compiled platformindependent binary files—one time zone reference source code includes compiler called zone information compiler well code read files standard application programming interfaces localtime mktime
definition time zoneedit
within database time zone national region local clocks agreed since 197011 definition concerns first geographic areas consistent local clocks different definitions concern consistent offsets prime meridian therefore time zones defined database document multiple offsets typically including standard time daylight saving time
time zone text files time zone zone lines time zone text files first zone line time zone gives name time zone subsequent zone lines time zone leave name blank indicating apply zone previous line zone line zone specifies range date time offset standard time name rules govern daylight saving time hyphen standard time always applies format time zone abbreviations last zone line date time range date time governed line ends
daylight saving time rulesedit
rules daylight saving time specified named rule sets rule rule lines time zone text files rule line contains name rule belongs first year rule applies last year rule applies applies year rule currently effect type year rule applies applies years specified range almost always case otherwise name used argument script indicates whether year specified type month rule takes effect rule takes effect could either specific specification last sunday month time rule takes effect amount time offset rule effect letter letters time zone abbreviation example rule governs standard time governs daylight saving time
names time zonesedit
time zones unique names form arealocation americanewyork choice also made english names equivalents omit punctuation common suffixes underscore character used place spaces hyphens used appear name location names maximum length characters12
areaedit
area name continent ocean continents oceans currently used africa america antarctica arctic asia atlantic australia europe indian pacific
oceans included since islands hard connect certain continent geographically connected continent politically another also boundaries continents
special area used administrative zones particularly etcutc represents coordinated universal time order conform posix style zone names beginning etcgmt sign reversed standard 8601 convention area zones west positive sign east negative sign name etcgmt14 hours ahead
locationedit
location name specific location within area usually city small island
country names used scheme primarily would robust frequent political boundary changes names large cities tend permanent however database maintainers attempt include least zone every 31661 alpha2 country code number user interfaces database take advantage additionally desire keep locations geographically compact future time zone changes split locations different time zonescitation needed
usually populous city region chosen represent entire time zone although cities selected widely known result less ambiguous namecitation needed event name city changes convention create aliascitation needed future editions names refer database entry
cases location represented compound name example time zone americaindianaindianapolis threelevel names include americaargentina americakentucky americaindiana americanorthdakota
location selected representative entire area

data stored zoneedit
time zone multiple offsets usually daylight saving time database records exact moment transition format accommodate changes dates times transitions well zones historical rule changes going back many decades shown example
zonetabedit
file zonetab public domain lists zones columns sorting described comments file follows

file contains table following columns
3166 2character country code file iso3166tab
latitude longitude zones principal location
6709 signdegreesminutesseconds format
either ddmmdddmm ddmmssdddmmss
first latitude north longitude east
zone name used value environment variable
comments present country multiple rows

columns separated single
table sorted first country order within country
makes geographical sense
puts populous zones first contradict

data 1970edit
data 1970 aims correct city identifying region necessarily correct entire region regions created required distinguish clocks since 1970
example 19631023 19631209 brazil states minas gerais espirito santo janeiro paulo summer time however requested split americasaopaulo rejected 2010 reasoning since 1970 clocks whole region14
time germany represented europeberlin correct year 1945 trizone used different daylight saving time rules berlin15
