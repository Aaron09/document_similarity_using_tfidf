historyedit
concept digital libraries emerged 1892 early ideas paul outlet ways cease violent wars eliminate national boundaries allow humanity become balanced discussed book called birth information interlink millions documents images audio video files together people could search system called mundaneum present time idea closely associated internet vannevar bush licklider contributors advanced idea newer technology bush seen researcher assisted making bomb dropped hiroshima seeing disaster wanted create machine would show technology lead understanding instead destruction machine would include desk screens switches buttons keyboard5 named memex individuals would able access stored books files rapid speed 1956 ford foundation funded licklider analyze libraries could improved technology almost decade later book entitled libraries future included vision wanted create system would computers networks human knowledge would accessible human needs feedback would automatic machine purposes system contained three components corpus knowledge question answer licklider called procognitive system
early projects centered creation electronic card catalogue known online public access catalog opac 1980s success endeavors resulted opac replacing traditional card catalog many academic public special libraries permitted libraries undertake additional rewarding cooperative efforts support resource sharing expand access library materials beyond individual library
early example digital library education resources information center eric born digital 19666
1994 digital libraries became popular million federal funded among universities research7 universities included carnegie mellon university university californiaberkeley university michigan university illinois university californiasanta barbara stanford university
terminologyedit
term digital libraries first popularized nsfdarpanasa digital libraries initiative 19948 draw heavily vannevar bushs essay think 1945 vision terms technology user experience term virtual library initially used interchangeably digital library primarily used libraries virtual senses libraries aggregate distributed content early days digital libraries discussion similarities differences among terms digital virtual electronic9
context delos network excellence digital libraries dlorg coordination action digital library interoperability best practices modelling foundations digital library researchers practitioners software developer produced digital library reference model1011 defines digital library potentially virtual organization comprehensively collects manages preserves long depth time rich digital content offers targeted user communities specialized functionality content defined quality according comprehensive codified policies12
distinction often made content created digital format known borndigital information converted physical medium paper digitization also noted electronic content digital data format term hybrid library sometimes used libraries physical collections electronic collections example american memory digital library within library congress
important digital libraries also serve long term archives arxiv internet archive others digital public library america seek make digital information various institutions widely accessible online13
academic repositoriesedit
many academic libraries actively involved building institutional repositories institutions books papers theses works digitized born digital many repositories made available general public restrictions accordance goals open access contrast publication research commercial journals publishers often limit access rights institutional truly free corporate repositories sometimes referred digital libraries
digital archivesedit
physical archives differ physical libraries several ways traditionally archives defined

containing primary sources information typically letters papers directly produced individual organization rather secondary sources found library books periodicals
contents organized groups rather individual items
unique contents

technology used create digital libraries even revolutionary archives since breaks second third general rules words digital archives online archives still generally contain primary sources likely described individually rather addition groups collections digital contents easily reproducible indeed reproduced elsewhere oxford text archive generally considered oldest digital archive academic physical primary source materials
archives differ libraries nature materials held libraries collect individual published books serials bounded sets individual items books journals held libraries unique since multiple copies exist given copy generally prove satisfactory copy material archives manuscript libraries unique records corporate bodies papers individuals families14
fundamental characteristic archives keep context records created network relationships order preserve informative content provide understandable useful information time fundamental characteristic archives resides hierarchical organization expressing context means archival bond archival descriptions fundamental means describe understand retrieve access archival material digital level archival descriptions usually encoded means encoded archival description format standardized electronic representation archival description makes possible provide union access detailed archival descriptions resources repositories distributed throughout world
digital libraries benefit existence sophisticated formal models framework streams structures spaces scenarios societies15 allow formally describe prove properties features
given importance archives dedicated formal model called nested sets object hierarchies nestor16 built around peculiar constituents defined nestor based idea expressing hierarchical relationships objects inclusion property sets contrast binary relation nodes exploited tree nestor used formally extend model define digital archive specific case digital library able take consideration peculiar features archives
futureedit
large scale digitization projects underway google million book project internet archive continued improvements book handling presentation technologies optical character recognition development alternative depositories business models digital libraries rapidly growing popularity libraries ventured audio video collections digital libraries internet archive google books project recently received court victory proceeding bookscanning project halted authors guild17 helped open road libraries work google better reach patrons accustomed computerized information
according larry lannom director information management technology nonprofit corporation national research initiatives cnri problems associated digital libraries wrapped archiving goes state years people still read article well solved problem daniel akst author webster chronicle proposes future libraries information digital peter lyman variant information scientists university california berkeley estimate worlds total yearly production print film optical magnetic content would require roughly billion gigabytes storage therefore believe soon technologically possible average person access virtually recorded information18
searchingedit
digital libraries provide search interface allows resources found resources typically deep invisible resources since frequently cannot located search engine crawlers digital libraries create special pages sitemaps allow search engines find resources digital libraries frequently open archives initiative protocol metadata harvesting oaipmh expose metadata digital libraries search engines like google scholar yahoo scirus also oaipmh find deep resources19
general strategies searching federation digital libraries distributed searching searching previously harvested metadata
distributed searching typically involves client sending multiple search requests parallel number servers federation results gathered duplicates eliminated clustered remaining items sorted presented back client protocols like z3950 frequently used distributed searching benefit approach resourceintensive tasks indexing storage left respective servers federation drawback approach search mechanism limited different indexing ranking capabilities database therefore making difficult assemble combined result consisting relevant found items
searching previously harvested metadata involves searching locally stored index information previously collected libraries federation search performed search mechanism need make connections digital libraries searching already local representation information approach requires creation indexing harvesting mechanism operates regularly connecting digital libraries querying whole collection order discover updated resources oaipmh frequently used digital libraries allowing metadata harvested benefit approach search mechanism full control indexing ranking algorithms possibly allowing consistent results drawback harvesting indexing systems resourceintensive therefore expensive
softwareedit
number software packages general digital libraries notable ones digital library software institutional repository software focuses primarily ingest preservation access locally produced documents particularly locally produced academic outputs found institutional repository software software proprietary case library congress uses digiboard manage digital content20
digitizationedit
past years procedures digitizing books high speed comparatively cost improved considerably result possible digitize millions books year21 google bookscanning project also working libraries offer digitize books pushing forward digitize book realm
recommendation systemsedit
many digital libraries offer recommender systems reduce information overload help users discovering relevant literature examples digital libraries offering recommender systems ieee xplore europeana gesis sowiport recommender systems work mostly based contentbased filtering also approaches used collaborative filtering citationbased recommendations22 beel report different recommendation approaches digital libraries presented research articles22
typically digital libraries develop maintain recommender systems based existing search recommendation frameworks apache lucene apache mahout however also recommendationasaservice provider specializing offering recommender system digital libraries service
advantagesedit
advantages digital libraries means easily rapidly accessing books archives images various types widely recognized commercial interests public bodies alike23
traditional libraries limited storage space digital libraries potential store much information simply digital information requires little physical space contain it24 cost maintaining digital library much lower traditional library physical library must spend large sums money paying staff book maintenance rent additional books digital libraries reduce instances away fees types library require cataloging input allow users locate retrieve material digital libraries willing adopt innovations technology providing users improvements electronic audio book technology well presenting forms communication wikis blogs conventional libraries consider providing online access catalog sufficient important advantage digital conversion increased accessibility users also increase availability individuals traditional patrons library geographic location organizational affiliation

physical boundary user digital library need library physically people world gain access information long internet connection available
round clock availability major advantage digital libraries people gain access information
multiple access resources used simultaneously number institutions patrons case copyrighted material library license lending copy time achieved system digital rights management resource become inaccessible expiration lending period lender chooses make inaccessible equivalent returning resource
information retrieval user able search term word phrase title name subject search entire collection digital libraries provide userfriendly interfaces giving click able access resources
preservation conservation digitization longterm preservation solution physical collections succeed providing access copies materials would otherwise fall degradation repeated digitized collections borndigital objects pose many preservation conservation concerns analog materials please following problems section page examples
space whereas traditional libraries limited storage space digital libraries potential store much information simply digital information requires little physical space contain media storage technologies affordable ever
added value certain characteristics objects primarily quality images improved digitization enhance legibility remove visible flaws stains discoloration25
easily accessible

digital preservationedit
main article digital preservation
digital preservation aims ensure digital media information systems still interpretable indefinite future2627 necessary component must migrated preserved emulated28 typically lower levels systems floppy disks example emulated bitstreams actual files stored disks preserved operating systems emulated virtual machine meaning content digital media information systems well understood migration possible case office documents282930 however least organization wider project created offline digital library egranary reproducing materials hard drive instead bitstream environment digital library contains builtin proxy server search engine digital materials accessed using internet browser31 also materials preserved future egranary intended places situations internet connectivity slow nonexistent unreliable unsuitable expensive
copyright licensingedit
digital libraries hampered copyright unlike traditional printed works laws digital copyright still formed republication material libraries require permission rights holders conflict interest libraries publishers wish create online versions acquired content commercial purposes 2010 estimated twentythree percent books existence created 1923 thus copyright printed date five percent still print 2010 thus approximately seventytwo percent books available public32
dilution responsibility occurs result distributed nature digital resources complex intellectual property matters become involved since digital material always owned library33 content many cases public domain selfgenerated content digital libraries project gutenberg work digitize outofcopyright works make freely available public estimate number distinct books still existent library catalogues 2000 1960 made3435
fair provisions copyright 1976 provide specific guidelines circumstances libraries allowed copy digital resources four factors constitute fair purpose nature work amount substantiality used market impact36
digital libraries acquire license lend resources involve restriction lending copy time license applying system digital rights management purpose also
digital millennium copyright 1998 created united states attempt deal introduction digital works incorporates treaties year 1996 criminalizes attempt circumvent measures limit access copyrighted materials also criminalizes attempting circumvent access control37 provides exemption nonprofit libraries archives allows three copies made digital made public distributed however allows libraries archives copy work format becomes obsolete38
copyright issues persist proposals forward suggesting digital libraries exempt copyright although would beneficial public negative economic effect authors less inclined create works39
another issue complicates matters desire publishing houses restrict digit materials ebooks purchased libraries whereas printed books library owns book longer circulated publishers want limit number times ebook checked library would need repurchase book harpercollins began licensing ebook copy maximum loans affects popular titles practical effect others limit reached library repurchase access rights lower cost original price publishing perspective sounds like good balance library lending protecting feared decrease book sales libraries monitor collections acknowledge increased demand digital materials available patrons desire digital library become expanded include best sellers publisher licensing hinder process
metadata creationedit
traditional libraries ability find works interest directly related well cataloged cataloging electronic works digitized librarys existing holding simple copying moving record print electronic form complex borndigital works require substantially effort handle growing volume electronic publications tools technologies designed allow effective automated semantic classification searching full text search used items many common catalog searches cannot performed using full text including

finding texts translations texts
differentiating editionsvolumes textperiodical
inconsistent descriptorsespecially subject headings
missing deficient poor quality taxonomy practices
linking texts published pseudonyms real authors samuel clemens mark twain example
differentiating nonfiction parody onion york times

disadvantagesedit
digital libraries least digital collections unfortunately also brought problems challenges areas

user authentication access collections
copyright
digital preservation
equity access digital divide
interface design
interoperability systems software
information organization
inefficient existent taxonomy practices especially historical material
training development
quality metadata
