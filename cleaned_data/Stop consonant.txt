terminologyedit
terms stop occlusive plosive often inaccurately used interchangeably linguists distinguish agree distinction made terms refer different features consonant stop refers airflow stopped occlusive refers articulation occludes blocks vocal tract plosive refers release burst plosion consonant therefore plosive stop released typically open speech sound vowel inaccurate call unreleased stop plosive rather stops applosives
either occlusive stop used general term covering together nasals occlusive defined oral occlusives stopsplosives plus nasal occlusives nasals stop defined oral stops plosives plus nasal stops nasals ladefoged maddieson 1996 prefer restrict stop oral occlusives

call simply nasals called nasal stops linguists avoid phrase preferring reserve term stop sounds complete interruption airflow1

addition plosive pulmonic stop stops usage include ejective implosive consonants2
term plosive used oral obstruents nasals called nasal stops stop mean glottal stop plosive even mean nonglottal stop cases however word plosive restricted glottal stop note generally speaking stops plosion release burst english example stops audible release however pulmonic stops plosion environments

common occlusives distribution stops nasals
articulationedit
articulation stop three phases distinguished

catch airway closes escape hence name stop
hold occlusion airway stays closed causing slight pressure difference build hence name occlusive
release burst closure opened released airflow produces sudden impulse causing audible sound burst hence name plosive

many languages malay vietnamese wordfinal stops lack release burst even followed vowel nasal release audible release
nasal occlusives somewhat similar catch hold airflow continues nose release burst final nasals typically unreleased across languages
affricates catch hold stop release fricative affricates stop–fricative contours
