peripheral nervous system divided somatic nervous system autonomic nervous system somatic nervous system voluntary control transmits signals brain organs muscles sensory nervous system part somatic nervous system transmits signals senses taste touch including fine touch gross touch spinal cord brain autonomic nervous system selfregulating system influences function organs outside voluntary control heart rate functions digestive system

also list nerves human body
somatic system includes sensory nervous system somatosensory system consists sensory nerves somatic nerves many nerves hold functions
head neck cranial nerves carry somatosensory data twelve cranial nerves originate brainstem mainly control functions anatomic structures head exceptions nuclei olfactory nerve optic nerves forebrain thalamus respectively thus considered true cranial nerves unique cranial nerve vagus nerve receives sensory information organs thorax abdomen accessory nerve responsible innervating sternocleidomastoid trapezius muscles neither exclusively head
rest body spinal nerves responsible somatosensory information arise spinal cord usually arise plexus interconnected nerves roots arrange form single nerves nerves control functions rest body humans pairs spinal nerves cervical thoracic lumbar sacral coccygeal nerve roots named according spinal vertebrata adjacent cervical region spinal nerve roots come corresponding vertebrae nerve root skull cervical vertebrae called spinal nerve thoracic region coccygeal region spinal nerve roots come corresponding vertebrae important note method creates problem naming spinal nerve root called spinal nerve root lumbar sacral region spinal nerve roots travel within dural travel level cauda equina
cervical spinal nerves c1–c4edit
information cervical plexus
first cervical spinal nerves split recombine produce variety nerves serve neck back head
spinal nerve called suboccipital nerve provides motor innervation muscles base skull form many nerves neck providing sensory motor control include greater occipital nerve provides sensation back head lesser occipital nerve provides sensation area behind ears greater auricular nerve lesser auricular nerve
phrenic nerve nerve essential survival arises nerve roots supplies thoracic diaphragm enabling breathing spinal cord transected spontaneous breathing possible
brachial plexus c5–t1edit
information brachial plexus
last four cervical spinal nerves first thoracic spinal nerve combine form brachial plexus plexus brachialis tangled array nerves splitting combining recombining form nerves subserve upperlimb upper back although brachial plexus appear tangled highly organized predictable little variation people brachial plexus injuries
lumbosacral plexus l1–co1edit
anterior divisions lumbar nerves sacral nerves coccygeal nerve form lumbosacral plexus first lumbar nerve frequently joined branch twelfth thoracic descriptive purposes plexus usually divided three parts

autonomic nervous systemedit
autonomic nervous system controls involuntary responses regulate physiological functions5 brain spinal cord central nervous system connected organs smooth muscle heart bladder cardiac exocrine endocrine related organs ganglionic neurons5 notable physiological effects autonomic activity pupil constriction dilation salivation saliva5 autonomic nervous system always activated either sympathetic parasympathetic state5 depending situation state overshadow resulting release different kinds neurotransmitters5 lesser known division autonomic nervous system known enteric nervous system6 located around digestive tract system allows local control without input sympathetic parasympathetic branches though still receive respond signals rest body6 enteric system responsible various functions related gastrointestinal system6
sympathetic nervous systemedit
sympathetic system activated “fight flight” situation great mental stress physical danger encountered5 neurotransmitters norepinephrine epinephrine released5 increases heart rate blood flow certain areas like muscle simultaneously decreasing activities noncritical functions survival like digestion6 systems independent allows activation certain parts body others remain rested6
parasympathetic nervous systemedit
primarily using neurotransmitter acetylcholine mediator parasympathetic system allows body function “rest digest” state6 consequently parasympathetic system dominates body increases salivation activities digestion heart rate sympathetic response decrease6 unlike sympathetic system humans voluntary controls parasympathetic system prominent examples control urination defecation6
