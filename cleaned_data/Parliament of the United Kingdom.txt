laws made acts united kingdom parliament acts apply whole united kingdom including scotland continuing separation scots many acts apply scotland matched either equivalent acts apply scotland alone since 1999 legislation scottish parliament relating devolved matters
paradox known west lothian question existence devolved scottish parliament means westminster scotland vote directly matters affect english constituencies much power laws affecting constituency since devolved english parliament converse true scottish parliament overturned amended ignored westminster practice happen legislative consent motions enables parliament vote issues normally devolved scotland wales northern ireland part united kingdom legislation
laws draft form known bills introduced member either house bill introduced minister known government bill introduced another member called private members bill different categorising bills involves subject bills involving general public called public bills bill seeks grant special rights individual small group individuals body local authority called private bill public bill affects private rights private bill would called hybrid bill although draft bills take pains avoid
private members bills make majority bills less likely passed government bills three methods introduce private members bill private members ballot session names ballot given time propose bill minute rule another method granted minutes outline case piece legislation standing order third method allows bill introduced without debate days notice given table office filibustering danger opponent bill waste much limited time allotted private members bills chance success current government opposes used moral issues bills decriminalise homosexuality abortion private members bills example governments sometimes attempt private members bills pass things would rather associated handout bills bills government hands private members ballots
bill goes several stages house first stage called first reading formality second reading general principles bill debated house vote reject bill passing motion bill read second time defeats government bills extremely rare last 2005
following second reading bill sent committee house lords committee whole house grand committee used consists members house latter operates special procedures used uncontroversial bills house commons bill usually committed public bill committee consisting members committee whole house used important legislation several types committees including select committees used rarely committee considers bill clause clause reports bill amended house detailed consideration consideration stage report stage occurs however practice used called kangaroo standing order allows speaker select amendments debated device also used standing order committee chairman restrict debate committee
house considered bill third reading follows house commons amendments made passage motion bill read third time passage whole bill house lords amendments bill moved passage third reading motion house lords must vote motion bill pass following passage house bill sent house passed identical form houses presented sovereigns assent house passes amendments agree houses cannot resolve disagreements bill fails
however since passage parliament 1911 power house lords reject bills passed house commons restricted restrictions placed parliament 1949 house commons passes public bill successive sessions house lords rejects times commons direct bill presented sovereign assent disregarding rejection bill house lords case bill must passed house commons least calendar month session provision apply bills originated house lords bills seeking extend duration parliament beyond five years private bills special procedure applies relation bills classified speaker house commons money bills money bill concerns solely national taxation public funds speakers certificate deemed conclusive circumstances house lords fails pass money bill within month passage house commons lower house direct bill submitted sovereigns assent immediately18
even passage parliament acts commons possessed preeminence cases financial matters ancient custom house lords introduce bill relating taxation supply amend bill insert provision relating taxation supply amend supply bill house commons free waive privilege sometimes allow house lords pass amendments financial implications house lords remains free reject bills relating supply taxation overruled easily bills money bills bill relating revenue supply money bill example includes subjects national taxation public funds
last stage bill involves granting royal assent theoretically sovereign either grant royal assent make bill withhold veto bill modern times sovereign always grants royal assent using norman french words reyne veult queen wishes instead case king last refusal grant assent 1708 queen anne withheld assent bill settling militia scotland words reyne savisera queen think
thus every bill obtains assent three components parliament becomes except house lords overridden parliament acts 1911 1949 words enacted queens kings excellent majesty advice consent lords spiritual temporal commons present parliament assembled authority follows18 house lords authority overridden parliament acts words enacted queens kings excellent majesty advice consent commons present parliament assembled accordance provisions parliament acts 1911 1949 authority follows appear near beginning parliament words known enacting formula
