rock crystallizes melt magma lava igneous rock rock weathered eroded redeposited lithified sedimentary rock turned metamorphic rock heat pressure change mineral content resulting characteristic fabric three types melt happens magma formed igneous rock crystallize




minerals


testsedit
study three types rock geologists evaluate minerals composed mineral distinct physical properties many tests determine specimens tested

luster measurement amount light reflected surface luster broken metallic nonmetallic
color minerals grouped color mostly diagnostic impurities change mineral’s color
streak performed scratching sample porcelain plate color streak help name mineral
hardness resistance mineral scratch
breakage pattern mineral either show fracture cleavage former breakage uneven surfaces latter breakage along closely spaced parallel planes
specific gravity weight specific volume mineral
effervescence involves dripping hydrochloric acid mineral test fizzing
magnetism involves using magnet test magnetism
taste minerals distinctive taste like halite tastes like table salt
smell minerals distinctive odor example sulfur smells like rotten eggs3
