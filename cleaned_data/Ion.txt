ions charged means like charged objects

attracted opposite electric charges positive negative vice versa
repelled like charges

formation monatomic ionsedit
monatomic ions formed gain loss electrons valence shell outermost electron shell atom inner shells atom filled electrons tightly bound positively charged atomic nucleus participate kind chemical interaction process gaining losing electrons neutral atom molecule called ionization
atoms ionized bombardment radiation usual process ionization encountered chemistry transfer electrons atoms molecules transfer usually driven attaining stable closed shell electronic configurations atoms gain lose electrons depending action takes least energy
example sodium atom single electron valence shell surrounding stable filled inner shells electrons since filled shells stable sodium atom tends lose extra electron attain stable configuration becoming sodium cation process
