creoles share grammatical similarities languages phylogenetically derived9 however widely accepted theory would account perceived similarities10 moreover grammatical feature shown specific creoles111213141516
many creoles known today arose last years result worldwide expansion european maritime power trade discovery extensive european colonial empires like nonofficial minority languages creoles generally regarded popular opinion degenerate variants dialects parent languages prejudice many creoles arose european colonies stigmatized become extinct however political academic changes recent decades improved status creoles living languages object linguistic study1718 creoles even granted status official semiofficial languages particular political territories
linguists recognize creole formation universal phenomenon limited european colonial period important aspect language evolution vennemann 2003 example 1933 sigmund feist postulated creole origin germanic languages19
scholars salikoko mufwene argue pidgins creoles arise independently different circumstances pidgin need always precede creole creole evolve pidgin pidgins according mufwene emerged trade colonies among users preserved native vernaculars daytoday interactions creoles meanwhile developed settlement colonies speakers european language often indentured servants whose language would standard first place interacted extensively noneuropean slaves absorbing certain words features slaves noneuropean native languages resulting heavily basilectalized version original language servants slaves would come creole everyday vernacular rather merely situations contact speaker superstrate necessary20
historyedit
originedit
english term creole comes french créole cognate spanish term criollo portuguese crioulo descending verb criar breed raise coming latin creare produce create21 specific sense term coined 16th 17th century great expansion european maritime power trade establishment european colonies continents
terms criollo crioulo originally qualifiers used throughout spanish portuguese colonies distinguish members ethnic group born raised locally immigrated adults commonly applied nationals colonial power distinguish españoles criollos people born colonies spanish ancestors españoles peninsulares born iberian peninsula spain however brazil term also used distinguish negros crioulos blacks born brazil african slave ancestors negros africanos born africa time term derivatives creole kréol kreyol kreyòl kriol krio lost generic meaning became proper name many distinct ethnic groups developed locally immigrant communities originally therefore term creole language meant speech creole peoples
geographic distributionedit
consequence colonial european trade patterns known europeanbased creole languages arose coastal areas equatorial belt around world including americas western africa along west india along southeast asia indonesia singapore macau hong kong philippines malaysia mauritius reunion seychelles oceania22
many creoles extinct others still survive caribbean north east coasts south america guyanas western africa australia australian kriol language indian ocean
atlantic creole languages based european languages elements african possibly amerindian languages indian ocean creole languages based european languages elements malagasy possibly asian languages however creoles like nubi sango derived solely noneuropean languages
social political statusedit

classificationedit
historic classificationedit
according external history four types creoles distinguished plantation creoles fort creoles maroon creoles creolized pidgins27 nature creole language phylogenetic classification particular creole usually matter dispute especially pidgin precursor parent tongues creoles pidgins disappeared could documented
phylogenetic classification traditionally relies inheritance lexicon especially core terms grammar structure however creoles core lexicon often mixed origin grammar largely original reasons issue language parent creole—that whether language classified portuguese creole english creole etc—often definitive answer become topic longlasting controversies social prejudices political considerations interfere scientific discussion171828
substrate superstrateedit
terms substrate superstrate often used languages interact however meaning terms reasonably welldefined second language acquisition language replacement events native speakers certain source language substrate somehow compelled abandon another target language superstrate29 outcome event erstwhile speakers substrate version superstrate least formal contexts substrate survive second language informal conversation demonstrated fate many replaced european languages etruscan breton venetian influence substrate official speech often limited pronunciation modest number loanwords substrate might even disappear altogether without leaving trace29
however dispute extent terms substrate superstrate applicable genesis description creole languages30 language replacement model appropriate creole formation contexts emerging language derived multiple languages without imposed replacement other3132 substratumsuperstratum distinction becomes awkward multiple superstrata must assumed papiamentu substratum cannot identified presence survival substratal evidence inferred mere typological analogies14 hand distinction meaningful contributions parent language resulting creole shown unequal scientifically meaningful way33 literature atlantic creoles superstrate usually means european substrate noneuropean african34
decreolizationedit
since creole languages rarely attain official status speakers fully formed creole eventually feel compelled conform speech parent languages decreolization process typically brings postcreole speech continuum characterized largescale variation hypercorrection language17
generally acknowledged creoles simpler grammar internal variability older established languages35 however notions occasionally challenged36 also language complexity
phylogenetic typological comparisons creole languages divergent conclusions similarities usually higher among creoles derived related languages languages europe among broader groups include also creoles based nonindoeuropean languages like nubi sango frenchbased creoles turn similar varieties french europeanbased creoles observed particular definite articles mostly prenominal englishbased creole languages english whereas generally postnominal french creoles variety french exported quebec 17th 18th century37 moreover european languages gave rise creole languages european colonies belong subgroup western indoeuropean highly convergent grammars point whorf joined single standard average european language group38 french english particularly close since english extensive borrowing typologically closer french germanic languages39 thus claimed similarities creoles mere consequences similar parentage rather characteristic features creoles
creole genesisedit
variety theories origin creole languages attempt explain similarities among arends muysken smith 1995 outline fourfold classification explanations regarding creole genesis

theories focusing european input
theories focusing noneuropean input
gradualist developmental hypotheses
universalist approaches

theories focusing european inputedit
monogenetic theory pidgins creolesedit
monogenetic theory pidgins creoles hypothesizes derived single mediterranean lingua franca west african pidgin portuguese 17th century relexified socalled slave factories western africa source atlantic slave trade theory originally formulated hugo schuchardt late 19th century popularized late 1950s early 1960s taylor40 whinnom41 thompson42 stewart43 however hypothesis longer actively investigated examples creoles hezhou evidently nothing lingua franca
domestic origin hypothesisedit
proposed hancock 1985 origin englishbased creoles west indies domestic origin hypothesis argues towards 16th century englishspeaking traders began settle gambia sierra leone rivers well neighboring areas bullom sherbro coasts settlers intermarried local population leading mixed populations result intermarriage english pidgin created pidgin learned slaves slave depots later took west indies formed component emerging english creoles
european dialect origin hypothesisedit
french creoles foremost candidates outcome normal linguistic change creoleness sociohistoric nature relative colonial origin44 within theoretical framework french creole language phylogenetically based french specifically 17thcentury koiné french extant paris french atlantic harbours nascent french colonies supporters hypothesis suggest noncreole french dialects still spoken many parts americas share mutual descent single koiné dialects found canada mostly québec acadian communities louisiana saintbarthélemy isolates parts americas45 approaches hypothesis compatible gradualism change models imperfect language transmission koiné genesis
foreigner talk baby talkedit
foreigner talk hypothesis argues pidgin creole language forms native speakers attempt simplify language order address speakers know language similarities found type speech speech directed small child also sometimes called baby talk46
arends muysken smith 1995 suggest four different processes involved creating foreigner talk

accommodation
imitation
telegraphic condensation
conventions

could explain creole languages much common avoiding monogenetic model however hinnenkamp 1984 analyzing german foreigner talk claims inconsistent unpredictable provide model language learning
simplification input supposed account creoles simple grammar commentators raised number criticisms explanation47

great many grammatical similarities amongst pidgins creoles despite different lexifier languages
grammatical simplification explained processes innate grammar bickertons language bioprogram theory
speakers creoles lexifier language often fail understand without learning language grammar pidgin creole
pidgins often used amongst speakers different substrate languages speakers lexifier language

another problem explanation potential circularity bloomfield 1933 points often based imitation incorrect speech nonnatives pidgin therefore mistaken assuming former gave rise latter
imperfect learningedit
imperfect second language learning hypothesis claims pidgins primarily result imperfect learning dominant lexifier language slaves research naturalistic processes revealed number features interlanguage systems also seen pidgins creoles

invariant verb forms derived infinitive least marked finite verb form
loss determiners determiners demonstrative pronouns adjectives adverbs
placement negative particle preverbal position
adverbs express modality
fixed single word order inversion questions
reduced absent nominal plural marking

imperfect learning compatible approaches notably european dialect origin hypothesis universalist models language transmission48
theories focusing noneuropean inputedit
theories focusing substrate noneuropean languages attribute similarities amongst creoles similarities african substrate languages features often assumed transferred substrate language creole preserved invariant substrate language creole process relexification substrate language replaces native lexical items lexical material superstrate language retaining native grammatical categories49 problem explanation postulated substrate languages differ amongst creoles meaningful ways bickerton 1981 argues number diversity african languages paucity historical record creole genesis makes determining lexical correspondences matter chance dillard 1970 coined term cafeteria principle refer practice arbitrarily attributing features creoles influence substrate african languages assorted substandard dialects european languages
representative debate issue contributions mufwene 1993 recent view parkvall 2000
sociohistoric similarities amongst many means creoles atlantic slave trade plantation system european colonies emphasized factors linguists mcwhorter 1999
gradualist developmental hypothesesedit
class creoles might start pidgins rudimentary second languages improvised speakers nonintelligible native languages keith whinnom hymes 1971 suggests pidgins need three languages form superstrate clearly dominant others lexicon pidgin usually small drawn vocabularies speakers varying proportions morphological details like word inflections usually take years learn omitted syntax kept simple usually based strict word order initial stage aspects speech syntax lexicon pronunciation tend quite variable especially regard speakers background
pidgin manages learned children community native language become fixed acquire complex grammar fixed phonology syntax morphology syntactic embedding pidgins become full languages single generation creolization second stage pidgin language develops fully developed native language vocabulary develop contain items according rationale lexical enrichment50
universalist approachesedit
universalist models stress intervention specific general processes transmission language generation generation speaker speaker process invoked varies general tendency towards semantic transparency first language learning driven universal process general process discourse organization main universalist theory still bickertons language bioprogram theory proposed 1980s51 bickerton claims creoles inventions children growing newly founded plantations around heard pidgins spoken without enough structure function natural languages children used innate linguistic capacities transform pidgin input fullfledged language alleged common features creoles would consequence innate abilities universal

last decade seen emergence questions nature creoles particular question complex creoles question whether creoles indeed exceptional languages
creole prototypeedit
features distinguish creole languages noncreoles proposed bickerton52 example
john mcwhorter53 proposed following list features indicate creole prototype

lack inflectional morphology three inflectional affixes
lack tone monosyllabic words
lack semantically opaque word formation

mcwhorter hypothesizes three properties exactly characterize creole however creole prototype hypothesis disputed

henri wittmann 1999 david 2001 argue languages manding soninke magoua french riau indonesian three features show none sociohistoric traits creole languages
