lead highly poisonous metal whether inhaled swallowed affecting almost every organ system human body219 airborne levels mgm3 immediately dangerous life health220 ingested lead absorbed bloodstream221 primary cause toxicity predilection interfering proper functioning enzymes binding sulfhydryl groups found many enzymes222 mimicking displacing metals cofactors many enzymatic reactions223 among essential metals lead interacts calcium iron zinc224 high levels calcium iron tend provide protection lead poisoning levels cause increased susceptibility217
effectsedit
lead cause severe damage brain kidneys ultimately death mimicking calcium lead cross bloodbrain barrier degrades myelin sheaths neurons reduces numbers interferes neurotransmission routes decreases neuronal growth222
symptoms lead poisoning include nephropathy coliclike abdominal pains possibly weakness fingers wrists ankles small blood pressure increases particularly middleaged older people apparent cause anemia several studies mostly crosssectional found association increased lead exposure decreased heart rate variability225 pregnant women high levels exposure lead cause miscarriage chronic highlevel exposure shown reduce fertility males226

exposure sourcesedit
lead exposure global issue since lead mining smelting battery manufacturingdisposalrecycling common many countries lead enters body inhalation ingestion skin absorption almost inhaled lead absorbed body ingestion rate 20–70 children absorbing higher percentage adults231
poisoning typically results ingestion food water contaminated lead less commonly accidental ingestion contaminated soil dust leadbased paint232 seawater products contain lead affected nearby industrial waters233 fruit vegetables contaminated high levels lead soils grown soil contaminated particulate accumulation lead pipes lead paint residual emissions leaded gasoline234
lead water pipes problematic areas soft acidic water235 hard water forms insoluble layers pipes whereas soft acidic water dissolves lead pipes236 dissolved carbon dioxide carried water result formation soluble lead bicarbonate oxygenated water similarly dissolve lead leadii hydroxide237 drinking water time cause health problems toxicity dissolved lead harder water calcium bicarbonate sulfate contain inside pipes coated protective layer lead carbonate lead sulfate238
ingestion applied leadbased paint major source exposure children direct source chewing painted window sills alternatively applied paint deteriorates peels pulverized dust enters body handtomouth contact contaminated food water alcohol ingesting certain home remedies result exposure lead compounds239
