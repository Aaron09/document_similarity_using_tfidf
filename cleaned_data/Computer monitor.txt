historyedit
early electronic computers fitted panel light bulbs state particular bulb would indicate onoff state particular register inside computer allowed engineers operating computer monitor internal state machine panel lights came known monitor early monitors capable displaying limited amount information transient rarely considered program output instead line printer primary output device monitor limited keeping track programs operationcitation needed
technology developed engineers realized output display flexible panel light bulbs eventually giving control displayed program monitor became powerful output device rightcitation needed
computer monitors formerly known visual display units term mostly fallen 1990s
technologiesedit

multiple technologies used computer monitors 21st century used cathode tubes largely superseded monitors
cathode tubeedit
main article cathode tube
first computer monitors used cathode tubes crts prior advent home computers late 1970s common video display terminal using physically integrated keyboard components system single large chassis display monochrome less sharp detailed modern flatpanel monitor necessitating relatively large text severely limiting amount information could displayed time highresolution displays developed specialized military industrial scientific applications costly general
earliest home computers trs80 commodore limited monochrome displays color display capability already standard feature pioneering apple introduced 1977 specialty graphically sophisticated atari introduced 1979 either computer could connected antenna terminals ordinary color used purposemade color monitor optimum resolution color quality lagging several years behind 1981 introduced color graphics adapter could display four colors resolution pixels could produce pixels colors 1984 introduced enhanced graphics adapter capable producing colors resolution 3501
1980s color monitors could clearly display 1024 pixels widely available increasingly affordable following decade maximum display resolutions gradually increased prices continued fall technology remained dominant monitor market millennium partly cheaper produce offered view angles close degrees2 crts still offer image quality advantagesclarification needed lcds improvements latter made much less obvious dynamic range early panels poor although text motionless graphics sharper characteristic known pixel caused moving graphics appear noticeably smeared blurry
liquid crystal displayedit

multiple technologies used implement liquid crystal displays throughout 1990s primary technology computer monitors laptops lower power consumption lighter weight smaller physical size lcds justified higher price versus commonly laptop would offered assortment display options increasing price points active passive monochrome passive color active matrix color volume manufacturing capability improved monochrome passive color technologies dropped product lines
tftlcd variant dominant technology used computer monitors3
first standalone lcds appeared mid1990s selling high prices prices declined period years became popular 1997 competing monitors among first desktop computer monitors eizo mid1990s apple studio display 1998 apple cinema display 1999 2003 tftlcds outsold crts first time becoming primary technology used computer monitors2 main advantages lcds displays lcds consume less power take much less space considerably lighter common active matrix tftlcd technology also less flickering crts reduces strain4 hand monitors superior contrast superior response time able multiple screen resolutions natively discernible flicker refresh rate sufficiently high value monitors high temporal accuracy used vision research5
high dynamic range implemented highend monitors improve color accuracy since around late 2000s widescreen monitors become popular part television series motion pictures video games transitioning highdefinition makes standardwidth monitors unable display correctly either stretch crop content types monitors also display proper width however usually fill extra space bottom image black bars advantages widescreen monitors standardwidth monitors make work productive displaying users documents images allow displaying toolbars documents also larger viewing area typical widescreen monitor aspect ratio compared aspect ratio typical standardwidth monitor
organic lightemitting diodeedit
main article organic lightemitting diode
organic lightemitting diode oled monitors provide higher contrast better viewing angles lcds require power displaying documents white bright backgrounds 2011 25inch oled monitor cost 7500 prices expected drop6
measurements performanceedit
performance monitor measured following parameters

luminance measured candelas square meter cdm2 also called
aspect ratio ratio horizontal length vertical length monitors usually aspect ratio 1610
viewable image size usually measured diagonally actual widths heights informative since affected aspect ratio crts viewable size typically smaller tube
display resolution number distinct pixels dimension displayed given display size maximum resolution limited pitch
pitch distance subpixels color millimeters general smaller pitch sharper picture appear
refresh rate number times second display illuminated maximum refresh rate limited response time
response time time pixel monitor takes active white inactive black back active white measured milliseconds lower numbers mean faster transitions therefore fewer visible image artifacts
contrast ratio ratio luminosity brightest color white darkest color black monitor capable producing
power consumption measured watts
deltae color accuracy measured deltae lower deltae accurate color representation deltae imperceptible human deltaes considered good require sensitive spot difference
viewing angle maximum angle images monitor viewed without excessive degradation image measured degrees horizontally vertically

sizeedit
main article display size




area height width displays identical diagonal measurements vary dependent aspect ratio


twodimensional display devices computer monitors display size view able image size actual amount screen space available display picture video working space without obstruction case aspects units design main measurements display devices width height total area diagonal
size display usually monitor manufacturers given diagonal distance opposite screen corners method measurement inherited method used first generation television picture tubes circular faces common circular external diameter glass envelope described size since circular tubes used display rectangular images diagonal measurement rectangular image smaller diameter tubes face thickness glass method continued even cathode tubes manufactured rounded rectangles advantage single number specifying size confusing aspect ratio universally
introduction flat panel technology diagonal measurement became actual diagonal visible display meant eighteeninch larger visible area eighteeninch cathode tube
estimation monitor size distance opposite corners take account display aspect ratio example 21inch widescreen display less area 21inch screen screen dimensions area 1360 widescreen 1210
aspect ratioedit
main article display aspect ratio
2003 computer monitors aspect ratio 2003 2006 monitors mostly 1610 aspect ratios became commonly available first laptops later also standalone monitors reasons transition productive uses monitors besides widescreen computer game play movie viewing word processor display standard letter pages side side well displays largesize drawings application menus time78 2008 1610 became common sold aspect ratio monitors year 1610 mainstream standard laptops notebook computers9
2010 computer industry started move 1610 chosen standard highdefinition television display size cheaper manufacture
2011 nonwidescreen displays aspect ratios manufactured small quantities according samsung demand square monitors decreased rapidly last couple years predict 2011 production similar panels halted lack demand10
resolutionedit
main article display resolution
resolution computer monitors increased time 320x200 early 1980s 800x600 late 1990s since 2009 commonly sold resolution computer monitors 1920x108011 2013 topend consumer monitors limited 2560x1600 excluding apple products monitors12 apple introduced 2880x1800 retina macbook june 2012 introduced 5120x2880 retina imac october 2014 2015 major display manufacturers released 3840x2160 resolution displays
