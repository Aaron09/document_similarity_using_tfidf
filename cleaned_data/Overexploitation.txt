historyedit




giant flightless birds called overexploited point extinction4 giant haasts eagle preyed also became extinct5


concern overexploitation relatively recent though overexploitation phenomenon observed millennia example ceremonial cloaks worn hawaiian kings made mamo bird single cloak used feathers 70000 birds nowextinct species dodo flightless bird mauritius another wellknown example overexploitation many island species naive certain predators allowing humans approach kill ease6
earliest times hunting important human activity means survival whole history overexploitation form overhunting overkill hypothesis quaternary extinction events explains megafaunal extinctions occurred within relatively short period time traced human migration convincing evidence theory north american large mammal species disappeared within 1000 years arrival humans western hemisphere continents7 fastest ever recorded extinction megafauna occurred zealand 1500 years settling islands species giant birds hunted extinction māori4 second wave extinctions occurred later european settlement
recent times overexploitation resulted gradual emergence concepts sustainability sustainable development built concepts sustainable yield8 ecodevelopment910 deep ecology1112

tragedy commons refers dilemma described article name written garrett hardin first published journal science 196813
central hardins essay example useful parable understanding overexploitation occur example first sketched 1833 pamphlet william forster lloyd hypothetical simplified situation based medieval land tenure europe herders sharing common entitled cows graze hardins example herders interest succeeding acquires onto land even carrying capacity common exceeded temporarily permanently damaged result herder receives benefits additional damage common shared entire group herders make individually rational economic decision common overexploited even destroyed detriment however since herders reach rational conclusion overexploitation form overgrazing occurs immediate losses pasture degraded point gives little return

therein tragedy locked system compels increase herd without limit—in world limited ruin destination toward rush pursuing interest society believes freedom commons hardin 196813

atlantic bluefin tuna currently seriously overexploited scientists 7500 tons annually sustainable limit fishing industry continue harvest 60000 tons


wild fisheries overexploitation overfishing occurs fish stock fished size average would support longterm maximum sustainable yield fishery18 however overexploitation sustainable
fishery starts harvesting fish previously unexploited stock biomass fish stock decrease since harvesting means fish removed sustainability rate fish replenish biomass reproduction must balance rate fish harvested harvest rate increased stock biomass decrease certain point maximum harvest yield sustained reached attempts increase harvest rate result collapse fishery point called maximum sustainable yield practice usually occurs fishery fished biomass harvesting started19
possible fish stock preharvest biomass adjust harvest rate biomass remains level case fishery sustainable overexploited stock point sustainable yield less could
fish stocks said collapse biomass declines percent maximum historical biomass atlantic stocks severely overexploited 1970s 1980s leading abrupt collapse 19921 even though fishing ceased stocks failed recover1 absence apex predator many areas trophic cascades1
world fisheries overexploited point current biomass less level maximizes sustainable yield20 depleted fisheries often recover fishing pressure reduced stock biomass returns optimal biomass point harvesting resumed near maximum sustainable yield21
tragedy commons avoided within context fisheries fishing effort practices regulated appropriately fisheries management effective approach assigning measure ownership form individual transferable quotas itqs fishermen 2008 large scale study fisheries used itqs ones didnt provided strong evidence itqs help prevent collapses restore fisheries appear decline2223

endangered speciesedit




humans overexploit resources overgrazing occur naturally caused native fauna shown upper right


overexploitation threatens onethird endangered vertebrates well groups excluding edible fish illegal trade wildlife valued billion year industries responsible include trade bushmeat trade chinese medicine trade41 convention international trade endangered species wild fauna flora cites order control regulate trade endangered animals currently protects varying degree 33000 species animals plants estimated quarter endangered vertebrates united states america half endangered mammals attributed overexploitation242
living organisms require resources survive overexploitation resources protracted periods deplete natural stocks point unable recover within short time frame humans always harvested food resources needed survive human populations historically small methods collection limited small quantities exponential increase human population expanding markets increasing demand combined improved access techniques capture causing exploitation many species beyond sustainable levels43 practical terms continued reduces valuable resources levels exploitation longer sustainable lead extinction species addition dramatic unforeseen effects ecosystem44 overexploitation often occurs rapidly markets open utilising previously untapped resources locally used species




carolina parakeet hunted extinction


today overexploitation misuse natural resources everpresent threat species richness prevalent looking island ecology species inhabit islands viewed world miniature island endemic populations prone extinction overexploitation often exist densities reduced reproductive rates45 good example island snails hawaiian achatinella french polynesian partula achatinelline snails species listed extinct critically endangered46 species partulidae considered extinct listed critically endangered47 wcmc attributed overcollecting lifetime fecundity extreme vulnerability exhibited among species48
another example humble hedgehog introduced scottish island uist population greatly expanded took consuming overexploiting shorebird eggs drastic consequences breeding success twelve species avifauna affected species numbers reduced 3949
substantial human migration civil unrest controls longer exist civil unrest example congo rwanda firearms become common breakdown food distribution networks countries leaves resources natural environment vulnerable50 animals even killed target practice simply spite government populations large primates gorillas chimpanzees ungulates mammals reduced hunting certain species eliminated altogether51 decline called bushmeat crisis
overall bird species become extinct since 1500 approximately total subject overexploitation52 including

great penguinlike bird north hunted feathers meat
carolina parakeet parrot species native eastern united states hunted crop protection feathers

species affected overexploitation include

international trade chinchilla vicuña giant otter numerous species

cascade effectsedit




overexploiting otters resulted cascade effects destroyed kelp forest ecosystems


overexploitation species result knockon cascade effects particularly apply overexploitation habitat loses apex predator loss predator dramatic increase prey species occur turn unchecked prey overexploit food resources population numbers dwindle possibly point extinction
classic example cascade effects occurred otters starting 17th century phased 1911 otters hunted aggressively exceptionally warm valuable pelts could fetch 2500 caused cascade effects kelp forest ecosystems along pacific coast north america54
otters’ primary food sources urchin hunters caused otter populations decline ecological release urchin populations occurred urchins overexploited main food source kelp creating urchin barrens areas seabed denuded kelp carpeted urchins longer food urchin became locally extinct well also since kelp forest ecosystems homes many species loss kelp caused cascade effects secondary extinctions55
1911 small group otters survived remote cove international treaty signed prevent exploitation otters heavy protection otters multiplied repopulated depleted areas slowly recovered recently declining numbers fish stocks overexploitation killer whales experienced food shortage observed feeding otters reducing numbers56
