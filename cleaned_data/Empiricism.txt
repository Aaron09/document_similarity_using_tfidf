philosophical empiricists hold knowledge properly inferred deduced unless derived ones sensebased experience5 view commonly contrasted rationalism states knowledge derived reason independently senses example john locke held knowledge knowledge gods existence could arrived intuition reasoning alone similarly robert boyle prominent advocate experimental method held innate ideas67 main continental rationalists descartes spinoza leibniz also advocates empirical scientific method89

late renaissance various writers began question medieval classical understanding knowledge acquisition fundamental political historical writing niccolò machiavelli friend francesco guicciardini initiated realistic style writing machiavelli particular scornful writers politics judged everything comparison mental ideals demanded people study effectual truth instead contemporary leonardo vinci 1452–1519 said find experience something fact contradicts authority written must abandon authority base reasoning findings16

british empiricism though term used time derives 17th century period early modern philosophy modern science term became useful order describe differences perceived founders francis bacon described empiricist rené descartes described rationalist thomas hobbes baruch spinoza next generation often also described empiricist rationalist respectively john locke george berkeley david hume primary exponents empiricism 18th century enlightenment locke person normally known founder empiricism
response earlytomid17th century continental rationalism john locke 1632–1704 proposed essay concerning human understanding 1689 influential view wherein knowledge humans posteriori based upon experience locke famously attributed holding proposition human mind tabula rasa blank tablet lockes words white paper experiences derived sense impressions persons life proceeds written sources ideas sensation reflection cases distinction made simple complex ideas former unanalysable broken primary secondary qualities primary qualities essential object question without specific primary qualities object would example apple apple arrangement atomic structure apple structured differently would cease apple secondary qualities sensory information perceive primary qualities example apple perceived various colours sizes textures still identified apple therefore primary qualities dictate object essentially secondary qualities define attributes complex ideas combine simple ones divide substances modes relations according locke knowledge things perception ideas accordance discordance different quest certainty descartes




bishop george berkeley


generation later irish anglican bishop george berkeley 1685–1753 determined lockes view immediately opened door would lead eventual atheism response locke forth treatise concerning principles human knowledge 1710 important challenge empiricism things exist either result perceived virtue fact entity perceiving berkeley fills humans perceiving whenever humans around text alciphron berkeley maintained order humans nature language handwriting god17 berkeleys approach empiricism would later come called subjective idealism1819
scottish philosopher david hume 1711–1776 responded berkeleys criticisms locke well differences early modern philosophers moved empiricism level skepticism hume argued keeping empiricist view knowledge derives sense experience accepted implications normally acceptable philosophers wrote example locke divides arguments demonstrative probable view must probable must rise tomorrow neither demonstrated conform language common ought divide arguments demonstrations proofs probabilities—by ‘proofs’ meaning arguments experience leave room doubt opposition20 and21

david humes empiricism numerous philosophical schools


hume maintained knowledge even basic beliefs natural world cannot conclusively established reason rather maintained beliefs result accumulated habits developed response accumulated sense experiences among many arguments hume also added another important slant debate scientific method—that problem induction hume argued requires inductive reasoning arrive premises principle inductive reasoning therefore justification inductive reasoning circular argument22 among humes conclusions regarding problem induction certainty future resemble past thus simple instance posed hume cannot know certainty inductive reasoning continue rise east instead come expect repeatedly done past22
hume concluded things belief external world belief existence self rationally justifiable according hume beliefs accepted nonetheless profound basis instinct custom humes lasting legacy however doubt skeptical arguments cast legitimacy inductive reasoning allowing many skeptics followed cast similar doubt

logical empiricismedit
main article logical positivism
logical empiricism also logical positivism neopositivism early 20thcentury attempt synthesize essential ideas british empiricism strong emphasis sensory experience basis knowledge certain insights mathematical logic developed gottlob frege ludwig wittgenstein figures movement otto neurath moritz schlick rest vienna circle along ayer rudolf carnap hans reichenbach

pragmatismedit
late 19th early 20th century several forms pragmatic philosophy arose ideas pragmatism various forms developed mainly discussions charles sanders peirce william james harvard 1870s james popularized term pragmatism giving peirce full credit patrimony peirce later demurred tangents movement taking redubbed regarded original idea name pragmaticism along pragmatic theory truth perspective integrates basic insights empirical experiencebased rational conceptbased thinking




charles sanders peirce


charles peirce 1839–1914 highly influential laying groundwork todays empirical scientific methodcitation needed although peirce severely criticized many elements descartes peculiar brand rationalism reject rationalism outright indeed concurred main ideas rationalism importantly idea rational concepts meaningful idea rational concepts necessarily beyond data given empirical observation later years even emphasized conceptdriven side ongoing debate strict empiricism strict rationalism part counterbalance excesses cohorts taken pragmatism datadriven strictempiricist view
among peirces major contributions place inductive reasoning deductive reasoning complementary rather competitive mode latter primary trend among educated since david hume wrote century peirce added concept abductive reasoning combined three forms reasoning serve primary conceptual foundation empirically based scientific method today peirces approach presupposes objects knowledge real things characters properties real things depend perceptions everyone sufficient experience real things agree truth according peirces doctrine fallibilism conclusions science always tentative rationality scientific method depend certainty conclusions selfcorrective character continued application method science detect correct mistakes thus eventually lead discovery truth35
