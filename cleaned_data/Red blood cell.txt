inner monolayer

phosphatidylethanolamine
phosphoinositol small amounts
phosphatidylserine

asymmetric phospholipid distribution among bilayer result function several energydependent energyindependent phospholipid transport proteins proteins called “flippases” move phospholipids outer inner monolayer others called “floppases” opposite operation concentration gradient energy dependent manner additionally also “scramblase” proteins move phospholipids directions time concentration gradients energy independent manner still considerable debate ongoing regarding identity membrane maintenance proteins cell membrane
