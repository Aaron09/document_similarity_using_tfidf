1970s helios spacecraft skylab apollo telescope mount provided scientists significant data solar wind solar corona helios probes us–german collaborations studied solar wind orbit carrying spacecraft inside mercurys orbit perihelion189 skylab space station launched nasa 1973 included solar observatory module called apollo telescope mount operated astronauts resident station102 skylab made first timeresolved observations solar transition region ultraviolet emissions solar corona102 discoveries included first observations coronal mass ejections called coronal transients coronal holes known intimately associated solar wind189
1980 solar maximum mission launched nasa spacecraft designed observe gamma rays xrays radiation solar flares time high solar activity solar luminosity months launch however electronics failure caused probe standby mode spent next three years inactive state 1984 space shuttle challenger mission sts41c retrieved satellite repaired electronics rereleasing orbit solar maximum mission subsequently acquired thousands images solar corona reentering earths atmosphere june 1989190
