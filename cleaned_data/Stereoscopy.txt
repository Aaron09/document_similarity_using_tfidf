backgroundedit
stereoscopy creates illusion threedimensional depth given twodimensional images5 human vision including perception depth complex process begins acquisition visual information taken eyes much processing ensues within brain strives make sense information functions occur within brain interprets eyes assessing relative distances objects viewer depth dimension objects cues brain uses gauge relative distances depth perceived scene include6

stereopsis
accommodation
overlapping object another
subtended visual angle object known size
linear perspective convergence parallel edges
vertical position objects closer horizon scene tend perceived farther away
haze contrast saturation color greater distance generally associated greater haze desaturation shift toward blue
change size textured pattern detail

first cues exist traditional twodimensional images paintings photographs television7
stereoscopy production illusion depth photograph movie twodimensional image presentation slightly different image adds first cues stereopsis images combined brain give perception depth points image produced stereoscopy focus plane regardless depth original scene second focus duplicated therefore illusion depth incomplete also mainly effects stereoscopy unnatural human vision mismatch convergence accommodation caused difference objects perceived position front behind display screen real origin light possible crosstalk eyes caused imperfect image separation methods stereoscopy

traditional stereoscopic photography consists creating illusion starting pair images stereogram easiest enhance depth perception brain provide eyes viewer different images representing perspectives object minor deviation equal nearly equal perspectives eyes naturally receive binocular vision




stereoscopic pair images combined coloring cyan viewed using simple anaglyph glasses


avoid eyestrain distortion images presented viewer object infinite distance perceived straight ahead viewers eyes neither crossed diverging picture contains object infinite distance horizon cloud pictures spaced correspondingly closer together
advantages sidebyside viewers lack diminution brightness allowing presentation images high resolution full spectrum color simplicity creation little additional image processing required circumstances pair images presented freeviewing device additional optical equipment needed
principal disadvantage sidebyside viewers large image displays practical resolution limited lesser display medium human dimensions image increased either viewing apparatus viewer must move proportionately away order view comfortably moving closer image order detail would possible viewing equipment adjusted difference

parallel viewing method uses image pair lefteye image left righteye image right fused threedimensional image appears larger distant actual images making possible convincingly simulate lifesize scene viewer attempts look images eyes substantially parallel looking actual scene difficult normal vision focus binocular convergence habitually coordinated approach decoupling functions view image pair extremely close completely relaxed eyes making attempt focus clearly simply achieving comfortable stereoscopic fusion blurry images lookthrough approach exerting effort focus clearly increasing viewing distance necessary regardless approach used image medium comfortable viewing stereoscopic accuracy size spacing images corresponding points distant objects scene separated distance viewers eyes average interocular distance viewing much widely separated images possible eyes never diverge normal usually requires previous training tends cause strain
crosseyed viewing method swaps left right images correctly seen crosseyed left viewing image right vice versa fused threedimensional image appears smaller closer actual images large objects scenes appear miniaturized method usually easier freeviewing novices fusion fingertip placed division images slowly brought straight toward viewers eyes keeping eyes directed fingertip certain distance fused threedimensional image seem hovering finger alternatively piece paper small opening used similar manner correctly positioned image pair viewers eyes seem frame small threedimensional image

prismatic selfmasking glasses used crosseyedview advocates reduce degree convergence required allow large images displayed however viewing uses prisms mirrors lenses assist fusion focus simply type stereoscope excluded customary definition freeviewing
stereoscopically fusing separate images without mirrors prisms simultaneously keeping sharp focus without suitable viewing lenses inevitably requires unnatural combination vergence accommodation simple freeviewing therefore cannot accurately reproduce physiological depth cues realworld viewing experience different individuals experience differing degrees ease comfort achieving fusion good focus well differing tendencies fatigue strain

main article stereo photography techniques
general purpose stereo photography goal duplicate natural human vision give visual impression close possible actually correct baseline distance right left images taken would distance eyes28 images taken baseline viewed using viewing method duplicates conditions picture taken result would image pretty much would seen site photo taken could described ortho stereo

stereo windowedit
concept stereo window always important since window stereoscopic image external boundaries left right views constituting stereoscopic image object lateral sides window placed front effect results unnatural undesirable called window violation best understood returning analogy actual physical window therefore contradiction different depth cues elements image hidden window window appears closer elements elements image appear closer window stereo window must always adjusted avoid window violations
objects seen front window dont reach lateral sides window objects seen close since always limit parallax range comfortable viewing
scene viewed window entire scene would normally behind window scene distant would distance behind window nearby would appear beyond window object smaller window could even window appear partially completely front applies part larger object smaller window goal setting stereo window duplicate effect
therefore location window versus whole image must adjusted image seen beyond window case viewing easier place window front image window plane screen
contrary case projection much larger screen much better window front screen called floating window instance viewed meters away viewers first therefore people normally background image infinite course viewers seated beyond window remote image made normal conditions first viewers background infinite viewers seated behind also background infinite since parallax background equal average human interocular
entire scene including window moved backwards forwards depth horizontally sliding left right views relative moving either images away center bring whole scene away viewer whereas moving either images toward center move whole scene toward viewer possible instance projectors used projection
stereo photography window adjustments accomplished shiftingcropping images forms stereoscopy drawings computer generated images window built design images generated
