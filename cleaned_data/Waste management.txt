number concepts waste management vary usage countries regions general widely used concepts include
waste hierarchyedit
waste hierarchy refers reduce reuse recycle classify waste management strategies according desirability terms waste minimisation waste hierarchy remains cornerstone waste minimisation strategies waste hierarchy extract maximum practical benefits products generate minimum amount waste resource recovery6 waste hierarchy represented pyramid basic premise policy take action first prevent generation waste next step preferred action reduce generation waste reuse next recycling would include composting following step material recovery wastetoenergy energy recovered processes landfill combustion level hierarchy final action disposal landfills incineration without energy recovery last step final resort waste prevented diverted recovered7page needed waste hierarchy represents progression product material sequential stages pyramid waste management hierarchy represents latter parts lifecycle product7page needed
lifecycle productedit
lifecycle begins design proceeds manufacture distribution follows waste hierarchys stages reduce reuse recycle stages lifecycle offers opportunities policy intervention rethink need product redesign minimize waste potential extend use7page needed behind lifecycle product optimize worlds limited resources avoiding unnecessary generation waste
resource efficiencyedit
resource efficiency reflects understanding current global economic growth development sustained current production consumption patterns globally extracting resources produce goods planet replenish7page needed resource efficiency reduction environmental impact production consumption goods final material extraction last disposal process resource efficiency address sustainability
polluterpays principleedit
polluterpays principle principle polluting party pays impact caused environment respect waste management generally refers requirement waste generator appropriate disposal unrecoverable material
historyedit
main article history waste management
throughout history amount waste generated humans insignificant population density societal levels exploitation natural resources common waste produced premodern times mainly ashes human biodegradable waste released back ground locally minimum environmental impact tools made wood metal generally reused passed generations
however civilizations seem profligate waste output others particular maya central america fixed monthly ritual people village would gather together burn rubbish large dumps8

edwin chadwicks 1842 report sanitary condition labouring population influential securing passage first legislation aimed waste clearance disposal


following onset industrialisation sustained urban growth large population centres england buildup waste cities caused rapid deterioration levels sanitation general quality urban life streets became choked filth lack waste clearance regulations9 calls establishment municipal authority waste removal powers occurred early 1751 corbyn morris london proposed preservation health people great importance proposed cleaning city uniform public management filth beconveyed thames proper distance country10
however mid19th century spurred increasingly devastating cholera outbreaks emergence public health debate first legislation issue emerged highly influential focus report sanitary condition labouring population 184211 social reformer edwin chadwick argued importance adequate waste removal management facilities improve health wellbeing citys population
nuisance removal disease prevention 1846 began steadily evolving process provision regulated waste management london metropolitan board works first citywide authority centralized sanitation regulation rapidly expanding city public health 1875 made compulsory every household deposit weekly waste moveable receptacles disposalâ€”the first concept dustbin12




manlove alliott 1894 destructor furnace incinerators waste disposal became popular late 19th century


dramatic increase waste disposal creation first incineration plants called destructors 1874 first incinerator built nottingham manlove alliott design albert fryer10 however opposition account large amounts produced wafted neighbouring areas13
similar municipal systems waste disposal sprung turn 20th century large cities europe north america 1895 york city became first city publicsector garbage management12
early garbage removal trucks simply open bodied dump trucks pulled team horses became motorized early part 20th century first close body trucks eliminate odours dumping lever mechanism introduced 1920s britain14 soon equipped hopper mechanisms scooper loaded floor level hoisted mechanically deposit waste truck garwood load packer first truck 1938 incorporate hydraulic compactor
