inconsistent dataedit
inconsistent spectral data tholen classification scheme uses letter formal spectral type example themistian asteroid athalia spectrum stony albedo carbonaceous asteroid time classification6
multiple typesedit
underlying numerical color analysis ambiguous objects assigned three types rather whereby sequence types reflects order increasing numerical standard deviation best fitting spectral type mentioned first6 case qualifying flag unusual spectrum used tholen taxonomy encompass four letters sctu

smass classificationedit
recent taxonomy introduced schelte richard binzel 2002 based small mainbelt asteroid spectroscopic survey smass 1447 asteroids7 survey produced spectra higher resolution ecas able resolve variety narrow spectral features however somewhat smaller range wavelengths observed also albedos considered attempting keep tholen taxonomy much possible given differing data asteroids sorted types given majority bodies fall three broad categories unusual bodies categorized several smaller types

color indicesedit

taxonomic classes used nonasteroid minor planets transneptunian object spectra
photometric system brightness object measured different wavelengthspecific filters passbands photometric system three different filters used

passband ultraviolet light
passband blue light
passband sensitive visible light specifically greenyellow portion visible light

observation brightness object measured twice different filter resulting difference magnitude called color index color indices common ones addition index photometric letters stand infrared also used

wavelengths visible light

appraisaledit
classification schemes expected refined andor replaced research progresses however spectral classification based coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys 1990s still standard scientists unable agree better taxonomic system largely difficulty obtaining detailed measurements consistently large sample asteroids finer resolution spectra nonspectral data densities would useful
