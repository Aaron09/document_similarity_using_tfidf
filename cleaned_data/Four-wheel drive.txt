lamborghini murciélago powers front viscous coupling unit rear slips






hmmwv 4wdawd powers wheels evenly continuously manually lockable center differential torsen differentials front rear


wheels fixed axle turn speed vehicle goes around curves either forces slip possible balance apparent distance covered creates uncomfortable mechanically stressful wheel prevent wheels allowed turn different speeds using mechanical hydraulic differential allows driveshaft independently drive output shafts axles differential wheel different speeds
differential distributing angular force form torque evenly distributing angular velocity turning speed average output shafts equal differential ring gear powered axle requires differential distribute power left right sides power distributed four wheels third center differential used distribute power front rear axles
described system handles extremely well able accommodate various forces movement distribute power evenly smoothly making slippage unlikely slip however recovery difficult left front wheel vehicle slips patch road instance slipping wheel spin faster wheels lower traction wheel since differential applies equal torque halfshaft power reduced wheels even good traction problem happen vehicles whenever driven wheel placed surface little traction raised ground simplistic design works acceptably well vehicles much less acceptable vehicles vehicles twice many wheels lose traction increasing likelihood happen vehicles also likely drive surfaces reduced traction however since torque divided amongst four wheels rather wheel receives approximately half torque vehicle reducing potential wheel slip

limiting slippageedit
main article limitedslip differential
many differentials limiting amount engine power gets sent attached output shafts result tire loses traction acceleration either lowtraction situation driving gravel engine power overcomes available traction tire slipping receives little power engine traction situations prevent vehicle moving overcome several designs differentials either limit amount slip called limitedslip differentials temporarily lock output shafts together ensure engine power reaches driven wheels equally
locking differentials work temporarily locking together differentials output shafts causing wheels turn rate providing torque case slippage generally used center differential distributes power front rear axles drivetrain turns wheels equally would normally fight driver cause handling problems concern wheels slipping
common factoryinstalled locking differentials either computercontrolled multiplate clutch viscous coupling unit join shafts differentials commonly used offroad vehicles generally manually operated locking devices multiplate clutch vehicles computer senses slippage locks shafts causing small jolt activates disturb driver cause additional traction loss viscous coupling differentials shear stress high shaft speed differences causes dilatant fluid differential become solid linking shafts design suffers fluid degradation exponential locking behaviorcitation needed designs gearing create small rotational difference hastens torque transfer
third approach limiting slippage taken torsen differential torsen differential allows output shafts receive different amounts torque design provide traction wheel spinning freely torque provides excellent handling less extreme situationscitation needed typical torsen differential deliver twice much torque high traction side traction exceeded lower traction side
fairly recent innovation automobiles electronic traction control traction control typically uses vehicles braking system slow spinning wheel forced slowing emulates function limitedslip differential using brakes aggressively ensure wheels driven speed also emulate locking differential noted technique normally requires wheel sensors detect wheel slipping activates wheel slip detected therefore typically mechanism actively prevent wheel slip cant lock differential advance wheel slip rather system designed expressly permit wheel slip occur attempt send torque wheels best traction preventing allwheel slip requirement limiting design
operating modesedit
architecture awd4wd system described describing possible operating modes1 single vehicle ability operate multiple modes depending driver selection mohan describes modes follows

wheel drive mode mode axle typically rear axle driven drive axle disconnected operating torque split ratio 0100
four wheel drive mode depending nature torque transfer axles define three submodes

parttime mode front rear axle drives rigidly coupled transfer case since driveline permit speed differentiation axles would cause driveline windup mode recommended ‘parttime’ offroad loose surface conditions driveline windup unlikely full torque could either axle depending road condition weight axles
fulltime mode axles driven times interaxle differential permits axles turn different speeds needed allows vehicle driven ‘fulltime’ mode regardless road surface without fear driveline windup standard bevel gear differentials torque split 5050 planetary differentials provide asymmetric torque splits needed system operates permanently fulltime mode sometimes called ‘allthetime 4wd’ allwheeldrive ‘awd’ interaxle differential locked mode reverts ‘parttime mode’
ondemand mode mode transfer case operates primarily mode torque transferred secondary axle needed modulating transfer clutch ‘open’ rigidly coupled state avoiding driveline windup torque modulation achieved active electronichydraulic control systems passive devices based wheel slip wheel torque described section traction control systems

addition basic modes could implementations combine modes system could clutch across center differential example capable modulating front axle torque fulltime mode 3070 torque split center differential 0100 torque split mode
