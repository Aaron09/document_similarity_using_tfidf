rationaleedit
among modern political theorists three contending conceptions fundamental rationale democracy aggregative democracy deliberative democracy radical democracy139
aggregativeedit
theory aggregative democracy claims democratic processes solicit citizens preferences aggregate together determine social policies society adopt therefore proponents view hold democratic participation primarily focus voting policy votes gets implemented
different variants aggregative democracy exist minimalism democracy system government citizens given teams political leaders right rule periodic elections according minimalist conception citizens cannot rule example issues time clear views views wellfounded joseph schumpeter articulated view famously book capitalism socialism democracy140 contemporary proponents minimalism include william riker adam przeworski richard posner
according theory direct democracy hand citizens vote directly representatives legislative proposals proponents direct democracy offer varied reasons support view political activity valuable socialises educates citizens popular participation check powerful elites importantly citizens really rule unless directly decide laws policies
governments tend produce laws policies close views median voter—with half left half right actually desirable outcome represents action selfinterested somewhat unaccountable political elites competing votes anthony downs suggests ideological political parties necessary mediating broker individual governments downs laid view 1957 book economic theory democracy141
robert dahl argues fundamental democratic principle comes binding collective decisions person political community entitled hisher interests given equal consideration necessarily people equally satisfied collective decision uses term polyarchy refer societies exists certain institutions procedures perceived leading democracy first foremost among institutions regular occurrence free open elections used select representatives manage public policy society however polyarchic procedures create full democracy example poverty prevents political participation142 similarly ronald dworkin argues democracy substantive merely procedural ideal143
