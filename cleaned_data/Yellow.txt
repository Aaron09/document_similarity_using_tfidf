optics color printing computer screensedit







color printing typically uses four colors cyan magenta yellow black primaries combined full strength resulting secondary mixtures green blue









mixing three theoretically results black imperfect formulations give true black additional component needed









example color printing 1902 combining images yellow magenta cyan creates fullcolor picture called cmyk color model









computer display yellow created combining green light right intensity black screen




yellow found green orange spectrum visible light color human sees looks light dominant wavelength nanometers
color printing yellow three colors along magenta cyan along black overlaid right combination along black print full color image cmyk color model particular yellow used called process yellow also known pigment yellow printers yellow canary yellow subtractive primary colors along magenta cyan process yellow color fixed conversion cmyk primaries different formulations used printers variations printed color pure yellow
yellow color television computer screen created completely different combining green light right level intensity color model

traditionally complementary color yellow purple colors opposite color wheel long used painters13 vincent gogh avid student color theory used combinations yellow purple several paintings maximum contrast harmony14
hunt defines colors complementary possible reproduce tristimulus values specified achromatic stimulus additive mixture stimuli15 colored lights mixed match specified white achromatic noncolored light colors lights complementary definition however constrain version white specified nineteenth century scientists grassmann helmholtz experiments concluded finding good complement spectral yellow difficult result indigo wavelength todays color scientists would call violet purple helmholtz says yellow indigo blue complements16 grassmann reconstructs newtons category boundaries terms wavelengths says indigo therefore falls within limits color according helmholtz complementary colors yellow lie17
