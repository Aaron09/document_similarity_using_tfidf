historyedit
history user interfaces divided following phases according dominant type user interface
1945–1968 batch interfaceedit







batch computing power extremely scarce expensive user interfaces rudimentary users accommodate computers rather around user interfaces considered overhead software designed keep processor maximum utilization little overhead possible
input side user interfaces batch machines mainly punched cards equivalent media like paper tape output side added line printers media limited exception system operators console human beings interact batch machines real time
submitting batch machine involved first preparing deck punched cards describing program dataset punching program cards wasnt done computer keypunches specialized typewriterlike machines notoriously bulky unforgiving prone mechanical failure software interface similarly unforgiving strict syntaxes meant parsed smallest possible compilers interpreters




holes punched card according prearranged code transferring facts census questionnaire statistics


cards punched would drop queue wait eventually operators would feed deck computer perhaps mounting magnetic tapes supply another dataset helper software would generate printout containing final results often abort notice attached error successful runs might also write result magnetic tape generate data cards used later computation
turnaround time single often spanned entire days lucky might hours realtime response unheard worse fates card queue computers actually required even tedious errorprone process toggling programs binary code using console switches earliest machines actually partly rewired incorporate program logic using devices known plugboards
early batch systems gave currently running entire computer program decks tapes include would think operating system code talk devices whatever housekeeping needed midway batch period 1957 various groups began experiment socalled “loadandgo” systems used monitor program always resident computer programs could call monitor services another function monitor better error checking submitted jobs catching errors earlier intelligently generating useful feedback users thus monitors represented first step towards operating systems explicitly designed user interfaces
1969–present commandline user interfaceedit
main article commandline interface




teletype model


commandline interfaces clis evolved batch monitors connected system console interaction model series requestresponse transactions requests expressed textual commands specialized vocabulary latency lower batch systems dropping days hours seconds accordingly commandline systems allowed user change mind later stages transaction response realtime nearrealtime feedback earlier results software could exploratory interactive ways possible interfaces still placed relatively heavy mnemonic load user requiring serious investment effort learning time master8
earliest commandline systems combined teleprinters computers adapting mature technology proven effective mediating transfer information wires human beings teleprinters originally invented devices automatic telegraph transmission reception history going back 1902 already become wellestablished newsrooms elsewhere 1920 reusing economy certainly consideration psychology rule least surprise mattered well teleprinters provided point interface system familiar many engineers users

importantly existence accessible screen twodimensional display text could rapidly reversibly modified made economical software designers deploy interfaces could described visual rather textual pioneering applications kind computer games text editors close descendants earliest specimens rogue6 still live part unix tradition

interface designedit
primary methods used interface design include prototyping simulation
typical human–machine interface design consists following stages interaction specification interface software specification prototyping

common practices interaction specification include usercentered design persona activityoriented design scenariobased design resiliency design
common practices interface software specification include cases constrain enforcement interaction protocols intended avoid errors
common practices prototyping based interactive design based libraries interface elements controls decoration

qualityedit
great interfaces share eight qualities characteristics

clarity interface avoids ambiguity making everything clear language flow hierarchy metaphors visual elements
concision11 easy make interface clear overclarifying labeling everything leads interface bloat much stuff screen time many things screen finding youre looking difficult interface becomes tedious real challenge making great interface make concise clear time
familiarity12 even someone uses interface first time certain elements still familiar reallife metaphors used communicate meaning
responsiveness13 good interface feel sluggish means interface provide good feedback user whats happening whether users input successfully processed
consistency14 keeping interface consistent across application important allows users recognize usage patterns
aesthetics dont need make interface attractive making something look good make time users spend using application enjoyable happier users good thing
efficiency time money great interface make user productive shortcuts good design
forgiveness good interface punish users mistakes instead provide means remedy

principle least astonishmentedit
principle least astonishment pola general principle design kinds interfaces based idea human beings full attention thing time15 leading conclusion novelty minimized
habit formationedit
interface used persistently user unavoidably develop habits using interface designers role thus characterized ensuring user forms good habits designer experienced interfaces similarly develop habits often make unconscious assumptions regarding user interact interface1516
