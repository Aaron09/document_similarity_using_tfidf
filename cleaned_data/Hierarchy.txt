nomenclatureedit
also glossary graph theory taxonomy general structure
hierarchies special vocabulary terms easiest understand hierarchy diagrammed
organizational context following terms often used related hierarchies12

object entity person department concept element arrangement member
system entire objects arranged hierarchically administration
dimension another word system online analytical processing cubes
member element object system dimension level rank
rank relative value worth complexity power importance authority level object
level objects rank importance
ordering arrangement ranks levels
hierarchy arrangement particular ranks levels multiple hierarchies possible dimension system
collection objects level
superior higher level object ranked higher level parent ancestor
subordinate lower level object ranked lower level child descendent
hierarch level hierarchy usually consisting object member dimension
peer object rank therefore level
neighbour adjacent levelranking immediate superior immediate inferior
interaction relationship object direct superior subordinate superiorinferior pair

direct interaction occurs object level exactly higher lower tree objects line


distance minimum number connections objects less number objects need crossed trace path object another
span qualitative description width level diagrammed number subordinates object

mathematical context graph theory general terminology used different
hierarchies specific vocabulary pertaining subject idea behind example data structures objects known nodes superiors called parents subordinates called children business setting superior supervisorboss peer colleague
degree branchingedit
degree branching refers number direct subordinates children object graph theory equivalent number vertices connected outgoing arcs directed graph node hierarchies categorized based maximum degree highest degree present system whole categorization yields broad classes linear branching
linear hierarchy maximum degree words objects visualized lineup object excluding bottom ones exactly direct subordinate direct superior note referring objects levels every hierarchy property respect levels normally level infinite number objects example linear hierarchy hierarchy life
branching hierarchy objects degree therefore minimum degree higher1 many people word hierarchy automatically evokes image branching hierarchy1 branching hierarchies present within numerous systems including organizations classification schemes broad category branching hierarchies subdivided based degree
flat hierarchy branching hierarchy maximum degree approaches infinity wide span2 often systems intuitively regarded hierarchical moderate span therefore flat hierarchy often viewed hierarchy example diamonds graphite flat hierarchies numerous carbon atoms decomposed subatomic particles
overlapping hierarchy branching hierarchy least object parent objects1 example graduate student cosupervisors student reports directly equally level authority within university hierarchy position tenure status
history termedit
possibly first english word hierarchy cited oxford english dictionary 1880 used reference three orders three angels depicted pseudodionysius areopagite 5th–6th centuries pseudodionysius used related greek word hierarchia reference celestial hierarchy ecclesiastical hierarchy3 greek term ἱεραρχία means rule priests ἱεράρχης ierarches meaning president sacred rites highpriest4 ἱερεύς iereus priest5 ἀρχή arche amongst others first place power rule6 dionysius credited first abstract noun since hierarchical churches roman catholic catholic church hierarchy eastern orthodox churches tables organization hierarchical modern sense word traditionally pinnacle head hierarchy term came refer similar organizational methods secular settings
visualizationedit




maslows hierarchy human needs example hierarchy visualized triangle diagram


hierarchy typically depicted pyramid height level represents levels status width level represents quantity items level relative whole example directors company could apex base could thousands people subordinates
pyramids typically diagrammed tree triangle diagram note trianglepyramid diagrams hierarchical example 1992 usda food guide pyramid serve emphasize size differences levels example triangle diagram appears right organizational chart diagram hierarchy within organization depicted tree form
recently computers allowed storage navigation ever larger data sets various methods developed represent hierarchies manner makes efficient available space computers screen examples include fractal maps treemaps radial trees
visual hierarchyedit
design field mainly graphic design successful layouts formatting content documents heavily dependent rules visual hierarchy visual hierarchy also important proper organization files computers
example visually representing hierarchy nested clusters nested clusters represents hierarchical relationships using layers information child element within parent element venn diagram structure representing hierarchy effective representing simple relationships example directing someone open file computer desktop first direct towards main folder subfolders within main folder keep opening files within folders designated file located
complicated hierarchies stair structure represents hierarchical relationships visual stacking visually imagine downward staircase beginning left descending right child elements towards bottom stairs parent elements structure effective representing complicated hierarchies steps placed obvious sequences steps concealed unless steps revealed sequence computer desktop example file sought found another file opened link desired file within another document steps must completed final destination reached
informal representationedit
plain english hierarchy thought which1

element superior
element hierarch superior elements

first requirement also interpreted mean hierarchy circular relationships association objects always transitive second requirement asserts hierarchy must leader root common objects
mathematical representationedit
main article hierarchy mathematics
mathematically general form hierarchy partially ordered poset7 system case entire poset constituted elements within system element shares particular unambiguous property objects property value grouped together resulting levels referred class
hierarchy particularly used refer poset classes organized terms increasing complexity operations addition subtraction multiplication division often performed certain sequence order usually addition subtraction performed multiplication division already applied problem parenthesis also representation hierarchy show operation done prior following ones example problem typically would multiply first based rules mathematical hierarchy parentheses placed know operations within parentheses first continuing problem rules largely dominant algebraic problems ones include several steps order solve hierarchy mathematics beneficial order quickly efficiently solve problem without process slowly dissecting problem rules known proper solving certain equations
subtypesedit
nested hierarchyedit




matryoshka dolls also known nesting dolls russian dolls doll encompassed inside another smallest reached concept nesting concept applied sets resulting ordering nested hierarchy


nested hierarchy inclusion hierarchy hierarchical ordering nested sets8 concept nesting exemplified russian matryoshka dolls doll encompassed another doll outer doll outer doll holds inner dolls next outer doll holds remaining inner dolls matryoshkas represent nested hierarchy level contains object size doll generalized nested hierarchy allows multiple objects within levels object parent level general concept demonstrated mathematically formulated following example

subsumptive containment hierarchyedit
subsumptive containment hierarchy classification object classes general specific names type hierarchy taxonomic hierarchy hierarchy71213 last term describes relationship level—a lowerlevel object member higher class taxonomical structure outlined subsumptive containment hierarchy using example linnaean taxonomy seen object part level mammalia member level animalia specifically human primate primate mammal subsumptive hierarchy also defined abstractly hierarchy concepts13 example linnaean hierarchy outlined entity name like animalia group species conceptualization animal
compositional containment hierarchyedit
compositional containment hierarchy ordering parts make system—the system composed parts14 engineered structures whether natural artificial broken manner
compositional hierarchy every person encounters every moment hierarchy life every person reduced organ systems composed organs composed tissues composed cells composed molecules composed atoms fact last levels apply matter least macroscopic scale moreover levels inherit properties children
particular example also emergent properties—functions seen lower level cognition property neurons brain—and scalar quality molecules bigger atoms cells bigger molecules concepts commonly exist compositional hierarchies required general property level hierarchies characterized bidirectional causation8 upward causation involves lowerlevel entities causing property higher level entity children entities interact yield parent entities parents composed least partly children downward causation refers effect incorporation entity higherlevel entity properties interactions furthermore entities found level autonomous

ethics behavioral psychology philosophies identityedit




careeroriented purposes diagrammed using hierarchy describing less important actions support larger goal


ethics various virtues enumerated sometimes organized hierarchically according certain brands virtue theory
random examples asymmetry compositional significance levels structure small parts whole hierarchical array depend meaning membership larger partsthere hierarchy activities human life productive activity serves guided moral life moral life guided practical reason practical reason used moral political life serves contemplative reason whereby contemplate practical reason sets aside time resources contemplative reason
work diverse theorists william james 1842–1910 michel foucault 1926–1984 hayden white important critiques hierarchical epistemology advanced james famously asserts work radical empiricism clear distinctions type category constant unwritten goal scientific reasoning discovered success declared aspects world organized differently involving inherent intractable ambiguities scientific questions often considered unresolved
hierarchy ethics emerged western europe west asia north africa around 1600s aspect term hierarchy refers distinguishable real unreal feminists marxists anarchists communists critical theorists others multiple interpretations criticize hierarchies commonly found within human society especially social relationships hierarchies present parts society businesses schools families relationships often viewed necessary entities stand hierarchical arrangements animals humans plants somewhich cultures also addition hierarchy however feminists marxists critical theorists others analyze hierarchy terms values power arbitrarily assigns group another hierarchical ethics offers logical reasoning compatible religious commitments somewhich cultures hierarchy within humanity family woman children social classes might hierarchy follows king civic officials craftsmen unskilled workers
