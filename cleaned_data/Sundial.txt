introductionedit
several different types sundials sundials shadow edge shadow others line spot light indicate time
shadowcasting object known gnomon long thin object sharp straight edge sundials employ many types gnomon gnomon fixed moved according season oriented vertically horizontally aligned earths axis oriented altogether different direction determined mathematics
given sundials light indicate time line light formed allowing suns rays thin slit focusing cylindrical lens spot light formed allowing suns rays pass small hole reflecting small circular mirror
sundials also many types surfaces receive light shadow planes common surface partial spheres cylinders cones shapes used greater accuracy beauty
sundials differ portability need orientation installation many dials requires knowing local latitude precise vertical direction level plumbbob direction true north portable dials selfaligning example dials operate different principles horizontal analemmatic dial mounted together plate designs times agree plate aligned properly
sundials indicate local solar time unless corrected time obtain official clock time three types corrections need made
firstly orbit earth perfectly circular rotational axis perfectly perpendicular orbit sundials indicated solar time thus varies clock time small amounts change throughout year correction great minutes described equation time sophisticated sundial curved style hour lines incorporate correction often instead simpler sundials used small plaque gives offsets various times year
secondly solar time must corrected longitude sundial relative longitude official time zone example sundial located west greenwich england within timezone shows earlier time official time example show noon official noon passed correction often made rotating hourlines angle equal difference longitudes
lastly adjust daylight saving time sundial must shift time away solar time amount usually hour correction made adjustment plaque numbering hourlines sets numbers

common type multiple dial sundials every face platonic solid regular polyhedron usually cube82
extremely ornate sundials composed applying sundial every surface solid object
cases sundials formed hollows solid object cylindrical hollow aligned earths rotational axis edges play role styles spherical hollow ancient tradition hemisphaerium antiboreum history section cases multiface dials small enough desk whereas others large stone monuments
polyhedrals dial faces designed give time different timezones simultaneously
prismatic dialsedit
prismatic dials special case polar dials sharp edges prism concave polygon serve styles sides prism receive shadow83 examples include threedimensional cross star david gravestones

bifilar sundialedit




bifilar dial showing wires


main article bifilar sundial
invented german mathematician hugo michnik 1922 bifilar sundial nonintersecting threads parallel dial usually second thread orthogonal first86 intersection threads shadows gives local solar time
digital sundialedit
main article digital sundial
digital sundial indicates current time numerals formed sunlight striking sundials type installed deutsches museum munich sundial park genk belgium small version available commercially patent type sundial87
globe dialedit
globe dial sphere aligned earths rotational axis equipped spherical vane88 similar sundials fixed axial style globe dial determines time suns azimuthal angle apparent rotation earth angle determined rotating vane give smallest shadow
noon marksedit




noon mark greenwich royal observatory analemma narrow figure8 shape plots equation time degrees time minutes versus altitude noon sundials location altitude measured vertically equation time horizontally


simplest sundials give hours rather note exact moment 1200 noon centuries past dials used correct mechanical clocks sometimes inaccurate lose gain significant time single
colonialera houses noonmark often found carved floor windowsill90 marks indicate local noon provide simple accurate time reference households possess accurate clocks modern times asian countries post offices clocks precision noonmark turn provide times rest society typical noonmark sundial lens analemmatic plate plate engraved figureeight shape corresponds plotting equation time described versus solar declination edge suns image touches part shape current month indicates 1200 noon
sundial cannonedit
main article sundial cannon
sundial cannon sometimes called meridian cannon specialized sundial designed create audible noonmark automatically igniting quantity gunpowder noon novelties rather precision sundials sometimes installed parks europe mainly late 18th early 19th century typically consist horizontal sundial addition gnomon suitably mounted lens focus rays exactly noon firing miniature cannon loaded gunpowder ball function properly position angle lens must adjusted seasonallycitation needed
meridian linesedit
horizontal line aligned meridian gnomon facing noonsun termed meridian line indicate time instead year historically used accurately determine length solar year examples bianchini meridian line santa maria degli angeli martiri rome cassini line petronio basilica bologna91
sundial mottoesedit
information list sundial mottoes
association sundials time inspired designers centuries display mottoes part design often cast device role memento mori inviting observer reflect transience world inevitability death kill time surely kill thee mottoes whimsical count sunny hours sundial make botch done better watch collections sundial mottoes often published centuriescitation needed
using sundial compassedit
also compass compass
horizontalplate sundial made latitude used mounted plate horizontal gnomon pointing celestial pole horizon shows correct time apparent solar time conversely directions cardinal points initially unknown sundial aligned shows correct apparent solar time calculated reading clock gnomon shows direction true north south allowing sundial used compass sundial placed horizontal surface rotated vertical axis shows correct time gnomon pointing north northern hemisphere south southern hemisphere method much accurate using watch compass cardinal directionwatch face used places magnetic declination large making magnetic compass unreliable alternative method uses sundials different designs multiple dials dials attached aligned oriented show time allows directions cardinal points apparent solar time determined simultaneously without requiring clockcitation needed

notesedit



technical writing word gnomon also mean perpendicular height nodus dial plate point style intersects dial plate called gnomon root
clock showing sundial time always agrees sundial locality
strictly local mean time rather standard time used however using standard time makes sundial useful since corrected time zone longitude
equation time considered positive sundial time ahead clock time negative otherwise graph shown section equation time correction example equation time minutes standard time sundial time
example halfcylindrical dial found wellesley college massachusetts61
chauceras parsons tale four oclock according guess
since eleven feet little less
shadow time fall
considering feet tall
henry part methinks happy life
better homely swain
upon hill
carve dials quaintly point point
thereby minutes
many makes hour full complete
many hours brings
many days finish year
many years mortal live
