largescale productionline manufacturing affordable cars started ransom olds 1901 oldsmobile factory lansing michigan based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered marc isambard brunel portsmouth block mills england 1802 assembly line style mass production interchangeable parts pioneered thomas blanchard 1821 springfield armory springfield massachusetts34 concept greatly expanded henry ford beginning 1913 worlds first moving assembly line cars highland park ford plant
result fords cars came line fifteenminute intervals much faster previous methods increasing productivity eightfold using less manpower 125manhours hour minutes35 successful paint became bottleneck japan black would fast enough forcing company drop variety colors available 1913 fastdrying duco lacquer developed 1926 source fords apocryphal remark color long black35 1914 assembly line worker could model four months pay35
fords complex safety procedures—especially assigning worker specific location instead allowing roam about—dramatically reduced rate injury combination high wages high efficiency called fordism copied major industries efficiency gains assembly line also coincided economic rise united states assembly line forced workers work certain pace repetitive motions output worker countries using less productive methods
