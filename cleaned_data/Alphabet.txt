specimen protosinaitic script earliest first phonemic scripts


middle bronze apparently alphabetic system known protosinaitic script appears egyptian turquoise mines sinai peninsula dated circa 15th century apparently left canaanite workers 1999 john deborah darnell discovered even earlier version first alphabet wadi elhol dated circa 1800 showing evidence adapted specific forms egyptian hieroglyphs could dated circa 2000 strongly suggesting first alphabet developed time10 based letter appearances names believed based egyptian hieroglyphs1 script characters representing vowels although originally probably syllabary unneeded symbols discarded alphabetic cuneiform script signs including three indicate following vowel invented ugarit 15th century script used destruction ugarit11
protosinaitic script eventually developed phoenician alphabet conventionally called protocanaanite 1050 oldest text phoenician script inscription sarcophagus king ahiram script parent script western alphabets tenth century forms distinguished namely canaanite aramaic aramaic gave rise hebrew script12 south arabian alphabet sister script phoenician alphabet script geez alphabet abugida descended vowelless alphabets true alphabets called abjads currently exemplified scripts including arabic hebrew syriac omission vowels always satisfactory solution weak consonants sometimes used indicate vowel quality syllable matres lectionis letters dual function since also used pure consonants13
protosinaitic protocanaanite script ugaritic script first scripts limited number signs contrast widely used writing systems time cuneiform egyptian hieroglyphs linear phoenician script probably first phonemic script12 contained dozen distinct letters making script simple enough common traders learn another advantage phoenician could used write many different languages since recorded words phonemically
script spread phoenicians across mediterranean2 greece script modified vowels giving rise ancestor alphabets west vowels independent letter forms separate consonants therefore first true alphabet greeks chose letters representing sounds exist greek represent vowels vowels significant greek language syllabical linear script used mycenaean greeks 16th century symbols including vowels early years many variants greek alphabet situation caused many different alphabets evolve

term alphabet used linguists paleographers wide narrow sense wider sense alphabet script segmental phoneme level—that separate glyphs individual sounds larger units syllables words narrower sense scholars distinguish true alphabets types segmental script abjads abugidas three differ treat vowels abjads letters consonants leave vowels unexpressed abugidas also consonantbased indicate vowels diacritics systematic graphic modification consonants alphabets narrow sense hand consonants vowels written independent letters16 earliest known alphabet wider sense wadi elhol script believed abjad successor phoenician ancestor modern alphabets including arabic greek latin italic alphabet cyrillic greek alphabet hebrew aramaic
examples presentday abjads arabic hebrew scripts true alphabets include latin cyrillic korean hangul abugidas used write tigrinya amharic hindi thai canadian aboriginal syllabics also abugida rather syllabary name would imply since glyph stands consonant modified rotation represent following vowel true syllabary consonantvowel combination would represented separate glyph
three types augmented syllabic glyphs ugaritic example basically abjad syllabic letters time vowels indicated cyrillic basically true alphabet syllabic letters coptic letter devanagari typically abugida augmented dedicated letters initial vowels though traditions zero consonant graphic base vowels
boundaries three types segmental scripts always clearcut example sorani kurdish written arabic script normally abjad however kurdish writing vowels mandatory full letters used script true alphabet languages semitic abjad mandatory vowel diacritics effectively making abugidas hand phagspa script mongol empire based closely tibetan abugida vowel marks written preceding consonant rather diacritic marks although short written indic abugidas could argue linear arrangement made true alphabet conversely vowel marks tigrinya abugida amharic abugida ironically original source term abugida completely assimilated consonants modifications longer systematic learned syllabary rather segmental script even extreme pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic

thus primary classification alphabets reflects treat vowels tonal languages classification based treatment tone though names exist distinguish various types alphabets disregard tone entirely especially carry heavy functional load somali many languages africa americas scripts tone abjads vowels commonly tones indicated diacritics vowels treated abugidas case vietnamese true alphabet thai abugida thai tone determined primarily choice consonant diacritics disambiguation pollard script abugida vowels indicated diacritics placement diacritic relative consonant modified indicate tone rarely script separate letters tones case hmong zhuang scripts regardless whether letters diacritics used common tone marked common vowel marked indic abugidas zhuyin tones unmarked diacritic indicate lack tone like virama indic
number letters alphabet quite small book pahlavi script abjad twelve letters point even fewer later today rotokas alphabet twelve letters hawaiian alphabet sometimes claimed small actually consists letters including ʻokina five long vowels however hawaiian braille letters rotokas small alphabet phonemes represent eleven book pahlavi small many letters conflated—that graphic distinctions lost time diacritics developed compensate arabic another script lost many distinct letter shapes example commashaped letter represented however apparent simplifications perversely make script complicated later pahlavi papyri half remaining graphic distinctions twelve letters lost script could longer read sequence letters instead word learned whole—that become logograms egyptian demotic




circles containing greek cyrillic latin alphabets share many letters although different pronunciations

largest known abjad sindhi letters largest alphabets narrow sense include kabardian abkhaz cyrillic letters respectively slovak latin script however scripts either count trigraphs separate letters spanish recently uses diacritics like slovak

alphabetical order
main article alphabetical order
alphabets often come associated standard ordering letters used purposes collation—namely listing words items called alphabetical order
basic ordering latin alphabet derived northwest semitic abgad order22 well established although languages using alphabet different conventions treatment modified letters french certain combinations letters multigraphs french considered additional letters purposes collation however icelandic accented letters considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds sounds represented unaccented counterparts spanish considered separate letter accented vowels also considered single letters 1994 real academia española changed collating order dictionary 2010 tenth congress association spanish language academies changed longer letters all2324
german words starting spells german phoneme inserted words initial incidentally loanwords instead appearing initial though single letter—in contrast several languages albanian representing phonemes considered separate single letters would follow letters respectively well hungarian welsh german words umlaut collated ignoring umlaut—contrary turkish adopted graphemes word like tüfek would come dictionary exception german telephone directory umlauts sorted like since names jäger appear also spelling jaeger distinguished spoken language
danish norwegian alphabets æ—ø—å whereas swedish finnish ones conventionally å—ä—ö
unknown whether earliest alphabets defined sequence alphabets today hanunoo script learned letter time particular order used collation definite order required however dozen ugaritic tablets fourteenth century preserve alphabet sequences abcde order later used phoenician continued minor changes hebrew greek armenian gothic cyrillic latin hmħlq used southern arabia preserved today ethiopic25 orders therefore stable least 3000 years
runic used unrelated futhark sequence later simplified arabic uses sequence although arabic retains traditional abjadi order numbering
brahmic family alphabets used india unique order based phonology letters arranged according produced mouth organization used southeast asia tibet korean hangul even japanese kana alphabet
names letters
phoenician letter names letter associated word begins sound acrophony continue used varying degrees samaritan aramaic syriac hebrew greek arabic
names abandoned latin instead referred letters adding vowel usually consonant exceptions borrowed greek alphabet rather etruscan known graeca greek pronounced graeca greek zeta greek—this discrepancy inherited many european languages term forms english american english time names sometimes shifted added double double french english name american comparing names english french gives clear reflection great vowel shift pronounced todays english contemporary french french names english names derived preserve qualities english vowels great vowel shift contrast names remain languages short vowels largely unaffected shift
cyrillic originally letters given names based slavic words later abandoned well favor system similar used latin
orthography pronunciation
main article phonemic orthography
alphabet adopted developed represent given language orthography generally comes providing rules spelling words language accordance principle alphabets based rules generally letters alphabet phonemes significant sounds spoken language perfectly phonemic orthography would consistent onetoone correspondence letters phonemes writer could predict spelling word given pronunciation speaker would always know pronunciation word given spelling vice versa however ideal usually achieved practice languages spanish finnish come close others english deviate much larger degree
pronunciation language often evolves independently writing system writing systems borrowed languages designed degree letters alphabet correspond phonemes language varies greatly language another even within single language
languages fail achieve onetoone correspondence letters sounds several ways

language represent given phoneme combination letters rather single letter twoletter combinations called digraphs threeletter groups called trigraphs german uses tetragraphs four letters tsch phoneme borrowed words dsch kabardian also uses tetragraph phonemes namely кхъу letters representing sound occur several instances hungarian well instance stands
language represent phoneme different letters combinations letters example modern greek write phoneme different ways ⟨ει⟩ ⟨οι⟩ ⟨υι⟩ though last rare
language spell words unpronounced letters exist historical reasons example spelling thai word beer เบียร์ retains letter final consonant present english word borrowed silences
pronunciation individual words change according presence surrounding words sentence sandhi
different dialects language different phonemes word
language different sets symbols different rules distinct sets vocabulary items japanese hiragana katakana syllabaries various rules english spelling words latin greek original germanic vocabulary

national languages sometimes elect address problem dialects simply associating alphabet national standard however international language wide variations dialects english would impossible represent language variations single phonetic alphabet
national languages like finnish turkish russian serbocroatian serbian croatian bosnian bulgarian regular spelling system nearly onetoone correspondence letters phonemes strictly speaking national languages lack word corresponding verb spell meaning split word letters closest match verb meaning split word syllables similarly italian verb corresponding spell compitare unknown many italians spelling usually trivial italian spelling highly phonemic standard spanish tell pronunciation word spelling vice versa certain phonemes represented given letter consistently pronounced french silent letters heavy nasal vowels elision seem lack much correspondence spelling pronunciation rules pronunciation though complex actually consistent predictable fair degree accuracy
extreme languages english pronunciations many words simply memorized correspond spelling consistent english partly great vowel shift occurred orthography established english acquired large number loanwords different times retaining original spelling varying levels even english general albeit complex rules predict pronunciation spelling rules successful time rules predict spelling pronunciation higher failure rate
sometimes countries written language undergo spelling reform realign writing contemporary spoken language range simple spelling changes word forms switching entire writing system turkey switched arabic alphabet latinbased turkish alphabet
standard system symbols used linguists represent sounds language independently orthography called international phonetic alphabet
