neotethys oligocene rupelian


epoch continents continued drift toward present positions antarctica became isolated finally developed
mountain building western north america continued alps started rise europe african plate continued push north eurasian plate isolating remnants tethys brief marine incursion marks early oligocene europe marine fossils oligocene rare north america appears land bridge early oligocene north america europe since faunas regions similar sometime oligocene south america finally detached antarctica drifted north towards north america also allowed antarctic circumpolar current flow rapidly cooling antarctic continent
floraedit
angiosperms continued expansion throughout world tropical subtropical forests replaced temperate deciduous forests open plains deserts became common grasses expanded waterbank habitat eocene moving open tracts however even period grass quite common enough modern savannas
north america subtropical species dominated cashews lychee trees present temperate trees rosesclarification needed beeches pines common legumes spread sedges bulrushes ferns continued ascent

oceansedit
oligocene sees beginnings modern ocean circulation tectonic shifts causing opening closing ocean gateways cooling oceans already commenced eoceneoligocene boundary11 continued cool oligocene progressed formation permanent antarctic sheets early oligocene possible glacial activity arctic influenced oceanic cooling though extent influence still matter significant dispute
effects oceanic gateways circulationedit
opening closing ocean gateways opening drake passage opening tasmanian gateway closing tethys seaway along final formation greenland–iceland–faroes sill played vital parts reshaping oceanic currents oligocene continents shifted modern configuration ocean circulation12
drake passageedit
drake passage located south america antarctica tasmanian gateway australia antarctica opened kept antarctica completely isolated southern ocean connection south america south american continent moved north drake passage opened enabled formation antarctic circumpolar current would kept cold waters antarctica circulating around continent strengthened formation antarctic bottom water abw1213 cold water concentrated around antarctica surface temperatures consequently continental temperatures would dropped onset antarctic glaciation occurred early oligocene14 effect drake passage opening glaciation subject much research however controversy still exists exact timing passage opening whether occurred start oligocene nearer even many theories agree eoceneoligocene boundary shallow flow existed south america antarctica permitting start antarctic circumpolar current15
stemming issue opening drake passage took place dispute great influence opening drake passage global climate early researchers concluded advent highly important perhaps even trigger antarctic glaciation12 subsequent global cooling studies suggested δ18o signature strong glaciation main trigger cooling15 study pacific ocean sediments researchers shown transition warm eocene ocean temperatures cool oligocene ocean temperatures took 300000 years11 strongly implies feedbacks factors integral rapid cooling11
late oligocene opening drake passageedit
latest hypothesized time opening drake passage early miocene11 despite shallow flow south america antarctica enough deep water opening allow significant flow create true antarctic circumpolar current opening occurred late hypothesized antarctic circumpolar current could much effect early oligocene cooling would existed
early oligocene opening drake passageedit
earliest hypothesized time opening drake passage around ma11 possible issues timing continental debris cluttering seaway plates question debris along known shackleton fracture zone shown recent study fairly young million years old13 study concludes drake passage would free allow significant deep water flow around would facilitated earlier onset antarctic circumpolar current
currently opening drake passage early oligocene favored
opening tasman gatewayedit
major oceanic gateway opening time tasman tasmanian depending paper gateway australia antarctica time frame opening less disputed drake passage largely considered occurred around gateway widened antarctic circumpolar current strengthened
tethys seaway closingedit
tethys seaway gateway rather right closing oligocene significant impact ocean circulation climate collisions african plate european plate indian subcontinent asian plate tethys seaway provided lowlatitude ocean circulation16 closure tethys built mountains zagros range drew carbon dioxide atmosphere contributing global cooling17
greenland–iceland–faroesedit
gradual separation clump continental crust deepening tectonic sill north atlantic would become greenland iceland faroe islands helped increase deep water flow area14 information evolution north atlantic deep water given sections
ocean coolingedit
evidence oceanwide cooling oligocene exists mostly isotopic proxies patterns extinction18 patterns species migration19 also studied gain insight ocean conditions thought glaciation antarctica significantly contributed cooling ocean however recent evidence tends deny this1320
deep wateredit
isotopic evidence suggests early oligocene main source deep water north pacific southern ocean greenlandicelandfaroe sill deepened thereby connected norwegian–greenland atlantic ocean deep water north atlantic began come play well computer models suggest occurred modern appearance thermohaline circulation started16
north atlantic deep wateredit
