terminologyedit
originally electoral districts equivalent counties used local government hence french unofficial term comté however became common especially ontario divide counties sufficient population multiple electoral divisions constitution 1867 created electoral ontario first general election used term ridings describe districts subdivisions counties1 word riding english þriðing onethird compare farthing literally onefourth english term denoting subdivision county
canadas earliest censuses fact citizens ridings bothwell cardwell monck niagara listed electoral district county residence instead actual county although term riding longer used officially indicate electoral district passed common usage
soon confederation urban population grew importantly city dwellers gained franchise property ownership longer required gain vote rural constituencies therefore became geographically larger 20th century generally encompassed counties word riding used refer electoral division
political partys local organization generally known riding association legal term electoral district association
naming conventionsedit
electoral district names usually geographic nature chosen represent community region within electoral district boundaries electoral districts quebec named historical figures rather geography louishébert honorémercier similarly alberta provincial districts geographic names historical personages edmontondecore laurence decore calgarylougheed peter lougheed james alexander lougheed practice longer employed provinces territories2
boundary adjustmentedit
electoral district boundaries adjusted reflect population changes decennial census depending significance boundary change electoral districts name change well adjustment electoral district boundaries official date changes legislated actual effect first subsequent election thus electoral district officially cease exist continue represented status house commons next election called example gives riding associations time organize prevents confusion would result changing elected electoral district assignments middle parliament
occasions timiskaming—french river toronto—danforth ridings name changed without boundary adjustment usually happens determined later date existing name sufficiently representative districts geographic boundaries circumstance sitting riding name change elections
formulaedit
present formula adjusting electoral boundaries adopted 19853 starts number seats parliament time seat automatically allocated canadas three territories leaving total population canadas provinces thus divided resulting electoral quotient population individual province divided electoral quotient determine number seats province officially entitled
finally special rules applied senatorial clause provinces number seats house commons never lower constitutionally mandated number senators regardless provinces population3 grandfather clause provinces number seats also never fall number seats 33rd canadian parliament3
province allocated extra seats base entitlement ensure rules 2004 example prince edward island would entitled single seat according electoral quotient senatorial clause province gained three seats equal four senators quebec entitled seats electoral quotient alone grandfather clause province gained seven seats equal seats 33rd parliament saskatchewan manitoba also gained seats grandfather clause brunswick gained seats senatorial clause nova scotia newfoundland labrador gained seats clauses
third protection clause exists province lose cent seats single adjustment3 specific application rule never needed practice process results provinces maintaining number seats redistribution next senatorial grandfather clauses prior 2015 election ontario alberta british columbia traditionally countrys three fastestgrowing provinces ever gained seats redistribution provinces still held number seats held 1985 thus already protected losing even seat clauses 2012 redistribution added three seats quebec first time since 1985 seven provinces ever gained seats cent clause thus become relevant ontario alberta british columbia undergoes rapid population decline leading reduction seat entitlement future
sources incorrectly state special provision guaranteeing certain number seats quebec also applied provision proposed failed charlottetown accord rule currently exists quebecs seat allotment house commons fact governed adjustment clauses provinces provisions unique quebec alone
2008 government prime minister stephen harper proposed amendment process would given alberta british columbia ontario three provinces whose electoral districts average size larger quebec total additional seats applying quebecs average 1050004 measure initially included british columbia alberta harper later proposed alternative plan included ontario however opposition emerged quebec politicians expressed concern province losing clout ottawa proportion seats house commons reduced finally three seats allotted quebec well measure pass 2011 election called5 forward election6 passed december 2011 fair representation bill c207 resulted 2012 redistribution process
boundary reviewedit
provinces final seat allotment determined independent election boundaries commission province reviews existing boundaries proposes adjustments public input sought lead changes final boundary proposal instance proposed boundaries accurately reflect communitys historical political economic relationship surrounding region community would thus advise boundary commission wished included different electoral district
example 2003 boundary adjustment boundary commission ontario originally proposed dividing city greater sudbury three districts urban core would remained largely unchanged sudbury communities west central city would merged algoma—manitoulin form riding greater sudbury—manitoulin east north central city would merged timiskaming create riding timiskaming—greater sudbury8
regions economic transportation patterns however timiskaming—greater sudbury particularly opposed potential residents voters sudbury concerned weakening representation city divided citybased riding large rural ones rather citybased ridings9 timiskaming district much strongly aligned connected north direct highway link sudbury deputation boundary commission sudburys deputy mayor dupuis stated electoral district must mere conglomeration arbitrary random groups individuals districts much possible cohesive units common interests related representation makes representative’s articulating interests constituency much easier9 instead final report passed house commons sudbury areas existing ridings sudbury nickel belt retained minor boundary adjustments timiskaming riding merged nipissing despite opposition arose 2003 process however virtually tripartite division city proposed boundary adjustment 201210 although concerns around balancing northern ontario regions population geographic size commission announced 2013 would retain existing electoral districts again11
similarly opposition arose toronto 2012 redistribution process especially proposal would divided church wellesley neighbourhood citys primary village existing riding toronto centre riding mount pleasant along length wellesley street12 final report northern boundary toronto centre shifted north charles street13
final report produced submitted parliament approval given voting report piece legislation known representation order canadian confederation boundaries defined constitution 1867 boundaries electoral districts updated 1872 1882 1892 1903 1914 1924 1933 1947 subsequent changes known representation order occurred 1952 1966 1976 1987 1996 200314 changes come force first dissolution parliament occurs least year proclamation14 example 2003 representation order deemed effective january 200415 came force dissolution 37th canadian parliament 2004
political issuesedit
electoral district boundaries proposed armslength body rather directly political parties gerrymandering generally seen issue canada however 2006 provincial government prince edward island accused gerrymandering16 rejected independent boundary commissions report instead proposed would seen cities charlottetown summerside gain additional seat fewer seats allocated rural areas province17 alternate gave every incumbent member governing party safe seat original report would forced partys mlas compete nomination contests
unequal size electoral districts across canada sometimes given rise discussion whether canadians enjoy equal democratic representation population5 example four electoral districts prince edward island average size 33963 voters electoral districts ontario alberta british columbia average size 125000 voters slightly smaller fact entire population prince edward island
conversely pure representation population creates distinct disadvantages canadians giving rise frequent debate balance population size electoral districts geographic size whereas urban districts toronto centre vancouver quadra notredamedegrâce—lachine small less rural districts timmins—james abitibi—baiejames—nunavik—eeyou desnethé—missinippi—churchill river encompass tens hundreds thousands square kilometres size thus canadians reside major urban centres typically live within walking distance federal provincial representatives constituency offices rural resident even able call federal provincial representatives constituency offices without incurring longdistance calling charges
rural politician represents dozens geographically dispersed small towns must normally incur much greater travel expenses forced drive several hours even travel order visit parts district even need maintain constituency office order properly represent constituents ontario example highest annual expense budgets among members legislative assembly ontario consistently filed representatives timmins—james kenora provinces largest northernmost electoral districts must spend travel toronto travel within ridings additional support staff multiple communities within ridings legislator province19
