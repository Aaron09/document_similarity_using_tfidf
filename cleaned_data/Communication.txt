main article nonverbal communication
nonverbal communication describes processes conveying type information form nonlinguistic representations examples nonverbal communication include haptic communication chronemic communication gestures body language facial expressions contact dresses nonverbal communication also relates intent message examples intent voluntary intentional movements like shaking hand winking well involuntary sweating3 speech also contains nonverbal elements known paralanguage rhythm intonation tempo stress affects communication subconscious level establishes trust likewise written texts include nonverbal elements handwriting style spatial arrangement words emoticons convey emotion
nonverbal communication demonstrates wazlawicks laws cannot communicate proximity formed awareness living creatures begin interpreting signals received4 functions nonverbal communication humans complement illustrate reinforce emphasize replace substitute control regulate contradict denovative message
nonverbal cues heavily relied express communication interpret others’ communication replace substitute verbal messages however nonverbal communication ambiguous verbal messages contradict nonverbal messages observation nonverbal behaviour relied judge another’s attitudes feelings rather assuming truth verbal message alone
several reasons nonverbal communication plays vital role communication
“nonverbal communication omnipresent” included every single communication total communication nonverbal channels body face voice appearance touch distance timing environmental forces must engaged facetoface interaction written communication also nonverbal attributes emails chats allow individual’s option change text font colours stationary emoticons capitalization order capture nonverbal cues verbal medium
“nonverbal behaviours multifunctional” many different nonverbal channels engaged time communication acts allow chance simultaneous messages sent received
“nonverbal behaviours form universal language system” smiling crying pointing caressing glaring nonverbal behaviours used understood people regardless nationality nonverbal signals allow basic form communication verbal communication effective language barriers
verbaledit
verbal communication spoken written conveyance message human language defined system symbols sometimes known lexemes grammars rules symbols manipulated word language also refers common properties languages language learning normally occurs intensively human childhood thousands human languages patterns sound gesture symbols enable communication others around languages tend share certain properties although exceptions defined line language dialect constructed languages esperanto programming languages various mathematical formalism necessarily restricted properties shared human languages
previously mentioned language characterized symbolic charles ogden richards developed triangle meaning model explain symbol relationship word referent thing describes meaning thought associated word thing
properties language governed rules language follows phonological rules sounds appear language syntactic rules arrangement words punctuation sentence semantic rules agreed upon meaning words pragmatic rules meaning derived upon context
meanings attached words literal otherwise known denotative relating topic discussed meanings take context relationships account otherwise known connotative relating feelings history power dynamics communicators8
written communication historical developmentedit
time forms ideas communication evolved continuing progression technology advances include communications psychology media psychology emerging field study
progression written communication divided three information communication revolutions9

written communication first emerged pictographs pictograms made stone hence written communication mobile pictograms began develop standardized simplified forms
next step occurred writing began appear paper papyrus clay media common shared writing systems leading adaptable alphabets communication became mobile
final stage characterized transfer information controlled waves electromagnetic radiation radio microwave infrared electronic signals

communication thus process meaning assigned conveyed attempt create shared understanding gregory bateson called replication tautologies universe10 process requires vast repertoire skills interpersonal processing listening observing speaking questioning analyzing gestures evaluating enables collaboration cooperation11

barriers effectivenessedit
barriers effective communication retard distort message intention message conveyed result failure communication process cause effect undesirable include filtering selective perception information overload emotions language silence communication apprehension gender differences political correctness24
also includes lack expressing knowledgeappropriate communication occurs person uses ambiguous complex legal words medical jargon descriptions situation environment understood recipient

physical barriers physical barriers often nature environment example natural barrier exists staff located different buildings different sites likewise poor outdated equipment particularly failure management introduce technology also cause problems staff shortages another factor frequently causes communication difficulties organization
system design system design faults refer problems structures systems place organization examples might include organizational structure unclear therefore makes confusing know communicate examples could inefficient inappropriate information systems lack supervision training lack clarity roles responsibilities lead staff uncertain expected
attitudinal barriers attitudinal barriers come result problems staff organization brought example factors poor management lack consultation employees personality conflicts result people delaying refusing communicate personal attitudes individual employees lack motivation dissatisfaction work brought insufficient training enable carry particular tasks simply resistance change entrenched attitudes ideascitation needed
ambiguity wordsphrases words sounding different meaning convey different meaning altogether hence communicator must ensure receiver receives meaning better words avoided using alternatives whenever possible
individual linguistic ability jargon difficult inappropriate words communication prevent recipients understanding message poorly explained misunderstood messages also result confusion however research communication shown confusion lend legitimacy research persuasion fails2526
physiological barriers result individuals personal discomfort caused—for example—by health poor eyesight hearing difficulties
bypassingthese happens communicators sender receiver attach symbolic meanings words sender expressing thought word receiver take different meaning example asap rest room
technological multitasking absorbency rapid increase technologicallydriven communication past several decades individuals increasingly faced condensed communication form email text social updates turn notable change younger generations communicate perceive selfefficacy communicate connect others everconstant presence another world ones pocket individuals multitasking physically cognitively constant reminders something else happening somewhere else bombard though perhaps advancement longterm effects notion currently explored figures sherry turkle27
fear criticizedthis major factor prevents good communication exercise simple practices improve communication skill become effective communicators example read article newspaper collect news television present front mirror boost confidence also improve language vocabulary
gender barriers communicators whether aware often agenda notable among different genders example many women found critical addressing conflict also noted likely withdraw conflict comparison women28 breakdown comparison shows many factors communication specific genders also room improvement well established guidelines

linear communication model


first major model communication introduced claude shannon warren weaver bell laboratories 194945 original model designed mirror functioning radio telephone technologies initial model consisted three primary parts sender channel receiver sender part telephone person spoke channel telephone receiver part phone could hear person shannon weaver also recognized often static interferes listening telephone conversation deemed noise
simple model often referred transmission model standard view communication information content message natural language sent form spoken language emisor sender encoder destination receiver decoder common conception communication simply views communication means sending receiving information strengths model simplicity generality quantifiability claude shannon warren weaver structured model based following elements

information source produces message
transmitter encodes message signals
channel signals adapted transmission
noise source distorts signal propagates channel
receiver decodes reconstructs message signal
destination message arrives

shannon weaver argued three levels problems communication within theory

technical problem accurately message transmitted
semantic problem precisely meaning conveyed
effectiveness problem effectively received meaning affect behavior

daniel chandler46 critiques transmission model stating

assumes communicators isolated individuals
allowance differing purposes
allowance differing interpretations
allowance unequal power relations
allowance situational contexts

1960 david berlo expanded shannon weavers 1949 linear model communication created smcr model communication47 sendermessagechannelreceiver model communication separated model clear parts expanded upon scholars
communication usually described along major dimensions message type things communicated source emisor sender encoder form form channel medium destination receiver target decoder receiver wilbur schram 1954 also indicated also examine impact message desired undesired target message48 parties communication includes acts confer knowledge experiences give advice commands questions acts take many forms various manners communication form depends abilities group communicating together communication content form make messages sent towards destination target oneself another person another entity corporation group beings
communication seen processes information transmission three levels semiotic rules

pragmatic concerned relations signsexpressions users
semantic study relationships signs symbols represent
syntactic formal properties signs symbols

therefore communication social interaction least interacting agents share common signs common semiotic rules commonly held rule sense ignores autocommunication including intrapersonal communication diaries selftalk secondary phenomena followed primary acquisition communicative competences within social interactions
light weaknesses barnlund 2008 proposed transactional model communication49 basic premise transactional model communication individuals simultaneously engaging sending receiving messages
slightly complex form sender receiver linked reciprocally second attitude communication referred constitutive model constructionist view focuses individual communicates determining factor message interpreted communication viewed conduit passage information travels individual another information becomes separate communication particular instance communication called speech senders personal filters receivers personal filters vary depending upon different regional traditions cultures gender alter intended meaning message contents presence communication noise transmission channel case reception decoding content faulty thus speech achieve desired effect problem encodetransmitreceivedecode model processes encoding decoding imply sender receiver possess something functions codebook code books least similar identical although something like code books implied model nowhere represented model creates many conceptual difficulties
theories coregulation describe communication creative dynamic continuous process rather discrete exchange information canadian media scholar harold innis theory people different types media communicate choose offer different possibilities shape durability society50page needed famous example using ancient egypt looking ways built media different properties stone papyrus papyrus called space binding made possible transmission written orders across space empires enables waging distant military campaigns colonial administration stone time binding construction temples pyramids sustain authority generation generation media change shape communication society50page needed
noiseedit
communication model noise interference decoding messages sent channel encoder many examples noise

environmental noise noise physically disrupts communication standing next loud speakers party noise construction site next classroom making difficult hear professor
physiologicalimpairment noise physical maladies prevent effective communication actual deafness blindness preventing messages received intended
semantic noise different interpretations meanings certain words example word weed interpreted undesirable plant yard euphemism marijuana
syntactical noise mistakes grammar disrupt communication abrupt changes verb tense sentence
organizational noise poorly structured communication prevent receiver accurate interpretation example unclear badly stated directions make receiver even lost
cultural noise stereotypical assumptions cause misunderstandings unintentionally offending nonchristian person wishing merry christmas
psychological noise certain attitudes also make communication difficult instance great anger sadness cause someone lose focus present moment disorders autism also severely hamper effective communication51

face communication noise redundancy acknowledgement must often used acknowledgements messages addressee informing originator hisher communication received understood52 message repetition feedback message received necessary presence noise reduce probability misunderstanding disambiguation regards attempt reducing noise wrong interpretations semantic value meaning sign subject noise presence multiple meanings makes sensemaking difficult disambiguation attempts decrease likelihood misunderstanding also fundamental skill communication processes activated counselors psychotherapists interpreters coaching sessions based colloquium information technology disambiguation process automatic disambiguation meanings words sentences also interest concern since earliest days computer treatment language53
