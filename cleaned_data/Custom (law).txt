central issue regarding recognition custom determining appropriate methodology know practices norms actually constitutes customary immediately clear classic western theories jurisprudence reconciled useful conceptual analyses customary thus scholars like john comaroff simon roberts2 characterised customary norms terms clearly remains disagreement seen john hunds critique comaroff roberts theory preference contributions hart hund argues harts concept solves conceptual problem scholars attempted articulate customary principles identified defined operate regulating social behaviour resolving disputes3

hund finds comaroff roberts flexibility thesis repertoire norms litigants adjudicator choose process negotiating solutions uncompelling3 therefore concerned disproving calls rule scepticism part notes concept custom generally denotes convergent behaviour customs force hund therefore draws harts analysis distinguishing social rules internal external aspects habits external aspects internal aspects reflective attitude part adherents toward certain behaviours perceived obligatory according common standard external aspects manifest regular observable behaviour obligatory harts analysis social rules amount custom legal force
hart identifies three differences habits binding social rules3 first social rule exists society frowns deviation habit attempts prevent departures criticising behaviour second criticism seen socially good reason adhering habit welcomed third members group behave common habit everyone else seen common standard followed least members hund however acknowledges difficulty outsider knowing dimensios criteria depend internal point view
hund first form rule scepticism concerns widely held opinion content customary derives practice actually objective rules since behaviour informs construction view impossible distinguish behaviour rule bound behaviour not—ie behaviour motivated adherence least done recognition merely response factors hund sees problematic makes quantifying almost impossible since behaviour obviously inconsistent hund argues misconception based failure acknowledge importance internal element view using criteria described problem deciphering constitutes particular community3
