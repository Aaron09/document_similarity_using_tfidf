sociological approaches study lawedit
modern sociology lawedit
sociology became clearly established academic field learning empirical research second world war30 world study central sociology although wellknown sociologists write role society work talcott parsons instance conceived essential mechanism social control31 response criticisms developed functionalism sociological perspectives emerged critical sociologists32 developed perspective instrument power however theorists sociology philip selznick argued modern became increasingly responsive societys needs approached morally well33 still scholars notably american sociologist donald black developed resolutely scientific theory basis paradigm pure sociology equally broad orientation different autopoietic systems theory german sociologist niklas luhmann presents legal system function systems functional differentiation society3435

collective human life directly indirectly shaped like knowledge essential allpervasive fact social condition
niklas luhmann sociological theory law36

social philosopher jürgen habermas disagrees luhmann argues better system institution representing faithfully interests everyday people lifeworld another sociological theory lawyers pierre bourdieu followers social field actors struggle cultural symbolic economic capital develop reproductive professional habitus lawyer37 several continental european countries empirical research sociology developed strongly 1960s 1970s poland work adam podgórecki associates often influenced petrazyckis ideas especially notable sweden empirical research sociology period pioneered especially stjernquist norway vilhelm aubert
recent years wide range theories emerged sociology result proliferation theories sociology large among recent influences mentioned work french philosopher michel foucault german social theorist jürgen habermas feminism postmodernism deconstruction neomarxism behaviorism variety theoretical influences sociology also marked broader society field multidisciplinary society field remains popular disciplinary speciality field sociology also better organized ever institutional professional respects38
societyedit
society american movement established second world initiative mainly sociologists vested interest study law39 rationale society movement subtly summed short sentences lawrence friedman massive vital presence united states important left lawyers40 founders believed study legal institutions social context could constituted scholarly field distinguished commitment interdisciplinary dialogue multidisciplinary research methods41 establishment society association 1964 society review 1966 guaranteed continuity scholarly activities society movement allowed members influence legal education policymaking us42
view main difference sociology society latter limit theoretically methodologically sociology tries instead accommodate insights social science disciplines43 provides home sociologists social anthropologists political scientists interest also tries incorporate psychologists economists study law44 another point view sociology society seen multidisciplinary transdisciplinary enterprises although sociology special ties methods theories traditions sociology45
1970s 1980s number original empirical studies conducted society scholars conflict dispute resolution early work william felstiner example focused alternative ways solve conflicts avoidance mediation litigation together richard abel austin sarat felstiner developed idea disputes pyramid formula naming blaming claiming refers different stages conflict resolution levels pyramid46
sociological jurisprudenceedit
sociology often distinguished sociological jurisprudence latter primarily concerned debates within mainstream sociology instead engages debates within jurisprudence legal theory sociological jurisprudence seeks base legal arguments sociological insights unlike legal theory concerned mundane practices create legal institutions social operations reproduce legal systems time developed united states louis brandeis roscoe pound474849 influenced work pioneer legal sociologists austrian jurist eugen ehrlich russianfrench sociologist georges gurvitch50
although distinguishing different branches social scientific studies allows explain analyse development sociology relation mainstream sociology legal studies potentially artificial distinctions necessarily fruitful development field whole social scientific studies transcend theoretical empirical limits currently define scope need beyond artificial distinctions51
sociolegal studiesedit
sociolegal studies grown mainly interest schools promoting interdisciplinary studies law52 whether regarded emerging discipline subdiscipline methodological approach often viewed light relationship oppositional role within law53 therefore confused legal sociology many west european countries society scholarship foster much stronger disciplinary ties social sciences past presented applied branch sociology criticised empiricist atheoretical54 travers example regards sociolegal studies subfield social policy mainly concerned influencing serving government policy provision legal services55 adds given aspirations develop general theories policy process56
notable practitioners sociolegal studies include professor carol smart codirector morgan centre study relationships personal life named sociologist david morgan well professor mavis maclean john eekelaar joint directors oxford centre family policy oxflap
sociolegal methods investigation
sociology methods investigation developed specifically conducting sociolegal research instead employs wide variety social scientific methods including qualitative quantitative research techniques explore legal phenomena positivistic57 well interpretive discourse analysis ethnographic58 approaches data collection analysis used within sociolegal field59
sociology britainedit
sociology small developing subfield british sociology legal scholarship time campbell wiles wrote review society research 1976 unfortunately despite initial promise remained small field empirical sociological studies published year nevertheless excellent studies representing variety sociological traditions well major theoretical contributions popular approaches 1960s 1970s interactionism marxism
symbolic interactionism marxism
interactionism become popular america 1950s 1960s politically radical alternative structuralfunctionalism instead viewing society system regulating controlling actions individuals interactionists argued sociology address people particular situations understood actions60 sociology deviance included topics crime homosexuality mental illness became focus theoretical debates functionalists portrayed crime problem managed legal system labeling theorists contrast focused process lawmaking enforcement crime constructed problem number british sociologists researchers schools drawn ideas writing crime61
influential sociological approach period however marxism—which claimed offer scientific comprehensive understanding society whole structuralfunctionalism although emphasis struggle different groups material advantage rather valueconsensus approach caught imagination many people leftwing political views schools also generated interesting empirical studies included historical studies particular statutes used advance interests dominant economic groups also carlens memorable ethnography62 combined analytic resources marxism interactionism especially sociology erving goffman writing magistrates courts
oxford centre sociolegal studies
1980s also fruitful time empirical sociology britain mainly donald harris deliberately create conditions fruitful exchange lawyers sociologists university oxford centre sociolegal studies fortunate enough recruit number young talented social scientists including maxwell atkinson robert dingwall interested ethnomethodology conversation analysis sociology professions doreen mcbarnet became something cult figure left publishing doctoral thesis63 advanced particularly clear vigorous marxist analysis criminal justice system ethnomethodology previously mentioned review tends overlooked many reviewers field since cannot easily assimilated theoretical interests note however always offered radical thoroughgoing theorizing action interactionism although approaches common compared traditions view society structural whole like marxism structuralfunctionalism time center maxwell atkinson collaborated paul drew sociologist university york became first conversation analytic study courtroom interaction using transcripts coroners hearings northern ireland64
another area interest developed oxford period sociology professions robert dingwall philip lewis65 edited remains interesting theoretically diverse collection bringing together specialists sociology medicine best known study date however published american scholar richard abel66 employed ideas concepts functionalist marxist weberian sociology explain high incomes status british lawyers enjoyed twentieth century
recent developments
since 1980s relatively empirical studies legal institutions conducted british sociologists studies empirical time engage theoretical concerns sociology67 however exceptions begin sociology along many areas academic work enlivened renewed engagement feminism great deal interest implications foucaults ideas governmentality understanding law68 also continental thinkers niklas luhmann pierre bourdieu argue rather fewer empirical studies produced might hoped great deal interesting work published
second exception found works researchers employed resources ethnomethodology symbolic interactionism studying legal settings69 type research clearly sociological rather sociolegal research continually engages debate theoretical traditions sociology travers doctoral thesis work firm criminal lawyers took sociologists especially marxists task addressing respecting lawyers clients understand actions standard argument used ethnomethodologists debates structural traditions discipline also however explored issues raised legal thinkers critique structural traditions sociology extent social science address content legal practice
despite relatively limited developments recent empirical research theoretical debates sociology important british literature recent decades contributions david nelken exploring problems comparative sociology potential idea legal cultures70 roger cotterrell seeking develop view relations community replace sees outdated society paradigms71 scholars david schiff richard nobles examining potential luhmannian systems theory extent seen autonomous social field rather intimately interrelated aspects social72 also significant burgeoning field sociolegal research regulation governmentcitation needed british scholars prominent contributors
devising sociological concept lawedit
contrast traditional understanding separate entry sociology normally view define system rules doctrine decisions exist independently society emerged rulebased aspect admittedly important provides inadequate basis describing analysing understanding societal context73 thus legal sociology regards institutional practices evolved time developed relation interaction cultural economic sociopolitical structures institutions modern social system strive gain retain autonomy function independently social institutions systems religion polity economy remains historically functionally linked institutions thus objectives sociology remains devise empirical methodologies capable describing explaining modern laws interdependence social institutions74
influential approaches within sociology challenged definitions terms official state example eugen ehrlichs concept living georges gurvitchs social standpoint understood broadly include legal system formal official legal institutions processes also various informal unofficial forms nomativity regulation generated within groups associations communities sociological studies thus limited analysing rules institutions legal system interact social class gender race religion sexuality social categories also focus internal normative orderings various groups communities community lawyers businessmen scientists members political parties members mafia interact short studied integral constitutive part social institutions groupings communities approach developed section legal pluralism75
nonwestern sociology lawedit
interest sociology continues widespread western countries important research produced indian scholars76 find limited amount sociolegal work researchers example middle east central northern parts africa77 thus global spread sociological studies appears uneven concentrated industrialised nations democratic political systems sense global expansion legal sociology taking place uniformly across national boundaries appears correlate combination factors national wealthpoverty form political organisation well historical factors growth welfare state however none factors alone explain disparity”78
contemporary perspectivesedit
legal pluralismedit
legal pluralism concept developed legal sociologists social anthropologists describe multiple layers usually different sources legitimacy exist within single state society79 also defined situation legal systems coexist social field80 legal pluralists define broadly include system courts judges backed coercive power state also nonlegal forms normative ordering81 legal pluralism consists many different methodological approaches concept embraces diverse often contested perspectives ranging recognition different legal orders within nationstate reaching openended concept necessarily depend state recognition validity latter concept come whenever legal systems exist social field82

ideology legal positivism powerful hold imagination lawyers social scientists picture legal world able successfully masquerade fact formed foundation stone social legal theory
john griffiths legal pluralism83

legal pluralism occupied central position sociolegal theorising beginning sociology sociological theories eugen ehrlich georges gurvitch early sociological contributions legal pluralism moreover provided enduring topic sociolegal debate many decades within sociology legal anthropology84 received share criticism proponents various schools legal positivism85 critics often distinguished pluralist view normative systems makes social rule system legal86
controversy arises mainly claim true made enforced modern state87 standpoint also known legal centralism legal centralist standpoint john griffiths writes state uniform persons exclusive administrated single state institutions88 thus according legal centralism customary laws religious laws properly called except state chosen adopt treat normative order part law89
distinction often made weak strong versions legal pluralism weak version necessarily question main assumptions legal centralism recognises within domain western state legal systems customary islamic also autonomous coexistence90 thus weak version consider forms normative ordering tamanaha critics legal pluralism puts normative ordering well normative ordering something else something isolate call law…91 strong version hand rejects legal centralist formalist models myth ideal claim illusion92 regarding state among many forms forms social ordering insists modern plural private well public importantly national public official legal system often secondary rather primary locus regulation93
criticism directed legal pluralism often uses basic assumptions legal positivism question validity theories legal pluralism criticising positivistic assumptions94 roger cotterrell explains pluralist conception understood part legal sociologists effort broaden perspectives legal sociologists specification might different presupposed lawyer practice relate indeed incorporate latter must reflect legal experience take account lawyers perspectives thus pluralist approach legal theory likely recognise lawyers typically recognize species larger genus treat lawyers conception reflecting particular perspectives determined particular objectives95
autopoiesisedit
humberto maturana francisco varela originally coined concept autopoiesis within theoretical biology describe selfreproduction living cells selfreference96 concept later borrowed reconstructed sociological terms introduced sociology niklas luhmann97 luhmanns systems theory transcends classical understanding objectsubject regarding communication action basic element social system breaks traditional systems theory talcott parsons descriptions based cybernetic feedback loops structural understandings selforganisation 1960s allows work towards devising solution problem humanised subject98
perhaps challenging idea incorporated theory autopoiesis social systems defined terms human agency norms communications communication turn unity utterance information understanding constitutes social systems recursively reproducing communication sociologically radical thesis raises fear dehumanised theory society attempts highlight fact social systems constituted communicative99
according roger cotterrell luhmann treats theory basis general sociological analysis social systems mutual relations100 theoretical claims laws autonomy powerful postulates presented advance even perhaps place kind detailed empirical study social legal change comparatists legal sociologists likely favour postulates autopoiesis theory much guide empirical research explain conclusively interpret whatever research discover101
legal culturesedit
legal culture central concepts sociology study legal cultures time regarded general approaches within sociology
concept refers relatively stable patterns legallyoriented social behaviour attitudes regarded subcategory concept culture102 relatively concept according david nelken traced terms like legal tradition legal style much longer history comparative early political science presupposes invites explore existence systematic variations patterns books action relation them103
approach focuses cultural aspects legal behaviour legal institutions thus affinity cultural anthropology legal pluralism comparative
lawrence friedman among sociolegal scholars introduced idea legal culture sociology friedman legal culture refers public knowledge attitudes behaviour patterns toward legal system104 also consist bodies custom organically related culture whole105 friedman stresses plurality legal cultures points explore legal cultures different levels abstraction level legal system state country community friedman also known introducing distinction internal external legal cultures somewhat oversimplified former refers general attitudes perceptions among functionaries legal system judiciary latter refer attitude citizenry legal system order generally
feminismedit
always regarded important sites engagement feminism pointed ruth fletcher feminist engagement taken many forms years also indicates successful merging theory practice litigation campaigns reform legal education feminists engaged explicitly legal profession taking provisions specialist advice services womens groups played role making accessible need subjecting legal concepts methods critical analysis feminists questioned terms legal debate106
globalizationedit
globalization often defined terms economic processes bring radical cultural developments level world society although essential ingredient process globalization important studies globalization already conducted 1990s example yves dezalay bryant garth107 volkmar gessner108 laws importance creating maintaining globalization processes often neglected within sociology globalization remain arguably somewhat underdeveloped within sociology law109
pointed halliday osinsky economic globalization cannot understood apart global business regulation legal construction markets increasingly depends cultural globalization cannot explained without attention intellectual property rights institutionalized global governance regimes globalization protections vulnerable populations cannot comprehended without tracing impact international criminal humanitarian international tribunals global contestation institutions democracy state building cannot meaningful unless considered relation constitutionalism110
sociolegal approaches study globalization global society often overlap make studies legal cultures legal pluralism111
