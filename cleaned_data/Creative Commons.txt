creative commons website states since licenses functions differently resources placed different licenses necessarily combined another without violating license terms36 works licensed incompatible licenses recombined derivative work without obtaining permission copyright owner373839
richard stallman stated 2005 couldn’t support creative commons activity adopted additional licenses give everyone minimum freedom freedom freedom share noncommercially published work40 licenses since retired creative commons41
