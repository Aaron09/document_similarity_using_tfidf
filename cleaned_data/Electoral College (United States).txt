discouragement turnout participationedit
except closely fought swing states voter turnout largely insignificant entrenched political party domination states electoral college decreases advantage political party campaign might gain encouraging voters turn except swing states118 presidential election decided national popular vote contrast campaigns parties would strong incentive work increase turnout everywhere119 individuals would similarly stronger incentive persuade friends neighbors turn vote differences turnout swing states nonswing states current electoral college system suggest replacing electoral college direct election popular vote would likely increase turnout participation significantly118

according criticism electoral college reduces elections mere count electors particular state result obscures voting problems within particular state example particular state blocks groups voting perhaps voter suppression methods imposing reading tests poll taxes registration requirements legally disfranchising specific minority groups voting inside state would reduced states electoral count would disenfranchisement effect overall electoral tally critics contend disenfranchisement partially obscured electoral college related argument electoral college dampening effect voter turnout incentive states reach citizens include elections states electoral count remains fixed event according view elections popular vote states would motivated include citizens elections since state would political clout nationally critics contend electoral college system insulates states negative publicity well possible federal penalties disenfranching subgroups citizens
legal scholars akhil amar vikram amar argued original electoral college compromise enacted partially enabled southern states disenfranchise slave populations120 permitted southern states disfranchise large numbers slaves allowing states maintain political clout within federation using threefifths compromise noted constitutional framer james madison believed question counting slaves presented serious challenge substitution electors obviated difficulty seemed whole liable fewest objections121 akhil vikram amar added

founders system also encouraged continued disfranchisement women direct national election system state gave women vote would automatically doubled national clout electoral college however state incentive increase franchise slaves mattered many women lived state many empowered state voter turnout gets precisely number electoral votes high turnout contrast welldesigned direct election system could spur states vote
