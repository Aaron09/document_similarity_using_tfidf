physics fluid substance continually deforms flows applied shear stress fluids subset phases matter include liquids gases plasmas extent plastic solids fluids substances zero shear modulus simpler terms fluid substance cannot resist shear force applied
although term fluid includes liquid phases common usage fluid often used synonym liquid implication could also present example brake fluid hydraulic perform required incompressible function colloquial usage term also common medicine nutrition take plenty fluids
liquids form free surface surface created container gases distinction solids fluid entirely obvious distinction made evaluating viscosity substance silly putty considered behave like solid fluid depending time period observed best described viscoelastic fluid many examples substances proving difficult classify particularly interesting pitch demonstrated pitch drop experiment currently running university queensland

properties typically function inability support shear stress static equilibrium contrast solids respond shear springlike restoring force means small deformations whether shear normal reversible
solids respond restoring forces shear stresses normal stresses—both compressive tensile contrast ideal fluids respond restoring forces normal stresses called pressure fluids subjected compressive stress corresponding positive pressure tensile stress corresponding negative pressure solids liquids also tensile strengths exceeded solids causes irreversible deformation fracture liquids causes onset cavitation gases tensile strength freely expand response changes pressure
solids liquids free surfaces cost amount free energy form case solids amount free energy form given unit surface area called surface energy whereas liquids quantity called surface tension ability liquids flow results different behaviour response surface tension solids although equilibrium minimise surface energy liquids tend form rounded droplets whereas pure solids tend form crystals gases free surfaces freely diffuse
