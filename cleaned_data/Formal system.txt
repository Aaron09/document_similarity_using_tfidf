backgroundedit
formal system uses primitive symbols sometimes known alphabet finitely construct formal language axioms inferential rules formation
system thus consists valid formulas built finite combinations primitive symbols—combinations formed axioms accordance stated rules1
formally expressed following

finite symbols used constructing formulas finite strings symbols
grammar tells wellformed formulas abbreviated constructed symbols alphabet usually required decision procedure deciding whether formula well formed
axioms axiom schemata axiom must
inference rules

recursiveedit
formal system said recursive effective recursively enumerable axioms inference rules decidable sets semidecidable sets respectively
inference entailmentedit
entailment system logical foundation distinguishes formal system others basis abstract model often formal system basis even identified larger theory field euclidean geometry consistent usage modern mathematics model theoryclarification needed
formal languageedit
main articles formal language formal grammar
formal language language defined formal system like languages linguistics formal languages generally aspects

syntax language language looks like formally possible expressions valid utterances language studied formal language theory
semantics language utterances language mean formalized various ways depending type language question

computer science linguistics formal grammar precise description formal language strings main categories formal grammar generative grammars sets rules strings language generated analytic grammars reductive grammar23 sets rules string analyzed determine whether member language short analytic grammar describes recognize strings members whereas generative grammar describes write strings
logical systemedit
logical system short logic formal system together form semanticsdisputed discuss usually form modeltheoretic interpretation assigns truth values sentences formal language formulae contain free variables logic sound sentences derived true interpretation complete conversely true sentences derived
deductive inferenceedit
deductive system also called deductive apparatus consists axioms axiom schemata rules inference used derive theorems system4
deductive systems preserve deductive qualities formulas expressed system usually quality concerned truth opposed falsehood however modalities justification belief preserved instead
order sustain deductive integrity deductive apparatus must definable without reference intended interpretation language ensure line derivation merely syntactic consequence lines precede element interpretation language gets involved deductive nature system
