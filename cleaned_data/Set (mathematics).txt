definitionedit




passage translation original definition georg cantor german word menge translated aggregate


welldefined collection distinct objects objects make also known sets elements members anything numbers people letters alphabet sets georg cantor founders theory gave following definition beginning beiträge begründung transfiniten mengenlehre1

gathering together whole definite distinct objects perception anschauung thought—which called elements

sets conventionally denoted capital letters sets equal precisely elements2
technical reasons cantors definition turned inadequate today contexts rigor required axiomatic theory notion taken primitive notion properties sets defined collection axioms basic properties elements sets equal every element element property called extensionality sets
describing setsedit
main article notation
ways describing specifying members intensional definition using rule semantic description

whose members first four positive integers
colors french flag

second extension listing member extensional definition denoted enclosing list members curly brackets


blue white

often choice specifying either intensionally extensionally examples instance
extensional definition member listed times example however extensionality definitions sets differ definitions lists members multiple times define fact hence exactly identical moreover order elements listed irrelevant unlike sequence tuple illustrate important points example



sets many elements enumeration members abbreviated instance first thousand positive integers specified extensionally

1000

ellipsis indicates list continues obvious ellipses also used sets infinitely many members thus positive even numbers written
notation braces also used intensional specification usage braces meaning playing card suits whose four members general form setbuilder notation instance twenty smallest integers four less perfect square denoted

integer

notation colon means description interpreted numbers form whole number range inclusive sometimes vertical used instead colon
membershipedit
main article element mathematics
objects denoted read belongs element member written read belong
example respect sets 1234 blue white integer defined


green

subsetsedit
main article subset
every member also member said subset written also pronounced contained equivalently write read superset includes contains relationship sets established called inclusion containment
subset equal called proper subset written proper subset proper superset
expressions used differently different authors authors mean respectively whereas others mean respectively




subset



example



proper subset people





empty subset every every subset








every subset universal







obvious useful identity often used show seemingly different sets equal







partition nonempty subsets every element exactly subsets
power setsedit
main article power
power subsets power contains empty subsets example power power usually written
power finite elements elements example contains three elements power shown contains elements
power infinite either countable uncountable always uncountable moreover power always strictly bigger original sense pair every element exactly element never onto surjection onto
every partition subset powerset
cardinalityedit
main article cardinality
cardinality number members example blue white
unique members called empty null denoted symbol notations used empty cardinality empty zero example threesided squares zero members thus empty though seem trivial empty like number zero important mathematics indeed existence fundamental concepts axiomatic theory
sets infinite cardinality natural numbers instance infinite infinite cardinalities greater others instance real numbers greater cardinality natural numbers however shown cardinality number points straight line cardinality segment line entire plane indeed finitedimensional euclidean space
special setsedit
sets hold great mathematical importance referred regularity acquired special names notational conventions identify empty denoted another unit contains exactly element namely many sets represented using blackboard bold bold typeface special sets numbers include

denoting primes









displaystyle mathbb

denoting natural numbers sometimes defined excluding









displaystyle mathbb

denoting integers whether positive negative zero
denoting rational numbers proper improper fractions example integers since every integer expressed fraction









displaystyle mathbb

denoting real numbers includes rational numbers together irrational numbers numbers cannot rewritten fractions well transcendental numbers numbers cannot defined
denoting complex numbers example
denoting quaternions example

positive negative sets denoted superscript example represents positive rational numbers
sets numbers infinite number elements considered proper subset sets listed primes used less frequently others outside number theory related fields
basic operationsedit
several fundamental operations constructing sets given sets
unionsedit




union denoted



main article union theory
sets added together union denoted things members either
examples









basic properties unions













intersectionsedit
main article intersection theory
also constructed determining members sets common intersection denoted things members said disjoint




intersection denoted



examples








basic properties intersections













complementsedit




relative complement








complement







symmetric difference



main article complement theory
sets also subtracted relative complement also called settheoretic difference denoted elements members members note valid subtract members removing element green effect
certain settings sets discussion considered subsets given universal cases called absolute complement simply complement denoted







examples





integers even integers integers



basic properties complements


















extension complement symmetric difference defined sets

























displaystyle adelta basetminus bcup bsetminus



example symmetric difference 78910 9101112 781112 power becomes boolean ring symmetric difference addition ring empty neutral element intersection multiplication ring
cartesian productedit
main article cartesian product
constructed associating every element every element another cartesian product sets denoted ordered pairs member member
examples



white green white green white green





basic properties cartesian products










finite sets cardinality cartesian product product cardinalities







applicationsedit
theory seen foundation virtually mathematics derived example structures abstract algebra groups fields rings sets closed operations
main applications naive theory constructing relations relation domain codomain subset cartesian product given concept quick ordered pairs real quite familiar domain codomain also squares subset reals placed functional notation relation becomes reason equivalent given value function defined corresponding ordered pair member
axiomatic theoryedit
main article axiomatic theory
although initially naive theory defines merely welldefined collection well accepted soon several obstacles found definition spawned several paradoxes notably

russells paradox—it shows sets contain exist
cantors paradox—it shows sets cannot exist

reason phrase welldefined welldefined important free theory paradoxes nearly mathematics redefined terms theory attempt avoid paradoxes theory axiomatized based firstorder logic thus axiomatic theory born
purposes however naive theory still useful
principle inclusion exclusionedit
main article inclusion–exclusion principle




inclusionexclusion principle used calculate size union sets size union size sets minus size intersection


inclusion–exclusion principle counting technique used count number elements union sets size size intersection known expressed symbolically











































displaystyle acup babacap



general form principle used find cardinality finite union sets
