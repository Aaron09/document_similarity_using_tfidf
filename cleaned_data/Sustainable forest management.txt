independent certificationedit
main article certified wood
growing environmental awareness consumer demand socially responsible businesses helped thirdparty forest certification emerge 1990s credible tool communicating environmental social performance forest operations
many potential users certification including forest managers scientists policy makers investors environmental advocates business consumers wood paper individuals
thirdparty forest certification independent organization develops standards good forest management independent auditors issue certificates forest operations comply standards forest certification verifies forests wellmanaged defined particular standard chainofcustody certification tracks wood paper products certified forest processing point sale
rise certification emergence several different systems throughout world result single accepted forest management standard worldwide system takes somewhat different approach defining standards sustainable forest management
2009â€“2010 forest products annual market review united nations economic commission europefood agriculture organization stated years many issues previously divided certification systems become much less distinct largest certification systems generally structural programmatic requirements24
thirdparty forest certification important tool seeking ensure paper wood products purchase come forests wellmanaged legally harvested incorporating thirdparty certification forest product procurement practices centerpiece comprehensive wood paper policies include factors protection sensitive forest values thoughtful material selection efficient products25

although majority forests continue owned formally government effectiveness forest governance increasingly independent formal ownership34 since neoliberal ideology 1980s emanation climate change challenges evidence state failing effectively manage environmental resources emerged35 neoliberal regimes developing countries role state diminished market forces increasingly taken dominant socioeconomic role36 though critiques neoliberal policies maintained market forces inappropriate sustaining environment fact major cause environmental destruction37 hardins tragedy commons 1968 shown people cannot left wish land environmental resources thus decentralization management offers alternative solution forest governance34
shifting natural resource management responsibilities central state local governments occurring usually part broader decentralization process38 according rondinelli cheema 1983 four distinct decentralization options privatization transfer authority central government nongovernmental sectors otherwise known marketbased service provision delegation centrally nominated local authority devolution transfer power locally acceptable authority deconcentration redistribution authority central government field delegations central government major effective decentralization increased broadbased participation localpublic decision making 2000 world bank report reveals local government knows needs desires constituents better national government time easier hold local leaders accountable study west african tropical forest argued downwardly accountable andor representative authorities meaningful discretional powers basic institutional element decentralization lead efficiency development equity39 collaborates world bank report 2000 says decentralization improve resource allocation efficiency accountability equity linking cost benefit local services closely40
