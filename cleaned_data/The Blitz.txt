luftwaffe strategic bombingedit
main article strategic bombing
1920s 1930s power theorists like giulio douhet billy mitchell claimed forces could wars obviating need land fighting13 thought bombers would always could resisted particularly night industry seats government factories communications could destroyed depriving opponent means make bombing civilians would cause collapse morale loss production remaining factories democracies public opinion allowed thought particularly vulnerable united states army corps usaac adopted much apocalyptic thinking policy bomber command became attempt achieve victory destruction civilian communications industry14
luftwaffe took cautious view strategic bombing oppose strategic bombardment industries cities believed could greatly affect balance power battlefield disrupting production damaging civilian morale believe power alone could decisive luftwaffe policy systematic terror bombing luftwaffe adopt official policy deliberate bombing civilians 194215

vital industries transport centres would targeted shutdown valid military targets could claimed civilians targeted directly breakdown production would affect morale fight german legal scholars 1930s carefully worked guidelines type bombing permissible international direct attacks civilians ruled terror bombing concept attacking vital industries—and probable heavy civilian casualties breakdown civilian morale—was ruled acceptable16





walter wever


beginning national socialist regime 1939 debate german military journals role strategic bombardment contributors arguing along lines british americans17 general walter wever chief luftwaffe general staff march 1935 june 1936 championed strategic bombing building suitable aircraft although emphasised importance aviation operational tactical terms wever outlined five points strategy

destroy enemy force bombing bases aircraft factories defeat enemy forces attacking german targets
prevent movement large enemy ground forces decisive areas destroying railways roads particularly bridges tunnels indispensable movement supply forces
support operations army formations independent railways armoured forces motorised forces impeding enemy advance participating directly ground operations
support naval operations attacking naval bases protecting german naval bases participating directly naval battles
paralyse enemy armed forces stopping production armaments factories18

wever argued solely educated tactical operational matters also grand strategy economics armament production mentality potential opponents also known mirror imaging wevers vision realised staff studies subjects fell wayside academies focused tactics technology operational planning rather independent strategic offensives19

planned hitler never insisted upon luftwaffe planning strategic bombing campaign even give ample warning staff britain even russia possibility amount firm operational tactical preparation bombing campaign minimal largely failure hitler supreme commander insist upon commitment21
ultimately hitler trapped within vision bombing terror weapon formed 1930s threatened smaller nations accepting german rule rather submit bombardment fact important implications showed extent hitler personally mistook allied strategy morale breaking instead economic warfare collapse morale additional bonus22 hitler much attracted political aspects bombing mere threat produced diplomatic results 1930s expected threat german retaliation would persuade allies adopt policy moderation begin policy unrestricted bombing hope reasons political prestige within germany german population would protected allied bombings proved impossible began fear popular feeling would turn regime redoubled efforts mount similar terror offensive britain order produce stalemate sides would hesitate bombing all22
