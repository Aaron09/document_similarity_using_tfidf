conventional standard statesedit
many standard states nonphysical states often referred hypothetical states nevertheless thermodynamic properties welldefined usually extrapolation limiting condition zero pressure zero concentration specified condition usually unit concentration pressure using ideal extrapolating function ideal solution ideal behavior empirical measurements
gasesedit
standard state hypothetical state would pure substance obeying ideal equation standard pressure real perfectly ideal behavior definition standard state allows corrections nonideality made consistently different gases
liquids solidsedit
standard state liquids solids simply state pure substance subjected total pressure elements reference point δhfo defined stable allotrope element graphite case carbon βphase white case exception white phosphorus common allotrope phosphorus defined standard state despite fact metastable5
solutesedit
substance solution solute standard state hypothetical state would standard state molality amount concentration exhibiting infinitedilution behavior reason unusual definition behavior solute limit infinite dilution described equations similar equations ideal gases hence taking infinitedilution behavior standard state allows corrections nonideality made consistently different solutes standard state molality kg−1 standard state amount concentration dm−3
