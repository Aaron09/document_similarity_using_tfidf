updated köppen–geiger climate map1
































































köppen climate classification widely used climate classification systems first published russian german climatologist wladimir köppen 188423 several later modifications köppen notably 1918 193645 later german climatologist rudolf geiger 1954 1961 collaborated köppen changes classification system thus sometimes called köppen–geiger climate classification system67
köppen climate classification system modified within trewartha climate classification system middle 1960s revised 1980 trewartha system sought create refined middle latitude climate zone criticisms köppen system climate group broad8200–1

köppen climate classification scheme divides climates five main climate groups tropical temperate continental polar9 second letter indicates seasonal precipitation type third letter indicates level heat10
group tropical megathermal climates
type climate every month year average temperature higher significant precipitation

tropical rainforest climate average precipitation least every month
tropical monsoon climate driest month nearly always occurs soon winter solstice side equator precipitation less total annual precipitation
tropical savanna climate driest month precipitation less less total annual precipitation

group arid semiarid climates
type climate defined little precipitation
multiply average annual temperature celsius

total precipitation spring summer months april–september northern hemisphere october–march southern
30–70 total precipitation received spring summer
less total precipitation received spring summer

annual precipitation less threshold classification arid desert climate range 50–100 threshold classification semiarid steppe climate
