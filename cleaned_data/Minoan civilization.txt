etymologyedit
term minoan refers mythical king minos knossos origin debated commonly attributed archeologist arthur evans 1851–19415 minos associated greek mythology labyrinth evans identified site knossos
however karl hoeck already used title minoische kreta 1825 volume kreta appears first known word minoan mean ancient cretan
evans probably read hoecks book continued using term writings findings6 early civilization crete whole proposed—and suggestion generally adopted archaeologists countries—to apply name minoan7 evans said applied invented
hoeck idea archaeological crete existed mind crete mythology although evans 1931 claim term unminted used called brazen suggestion karadimas momigliano6 coined archaeological meaning
