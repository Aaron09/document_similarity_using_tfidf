rocket engines primarily used rockets rocket sleds experimental aircraft rocket engines extremely powerful heaviest vehicle ever leave ground saturn rocket powered five rocket engines generating combined million horsepower42 1342 gigawatt rocket engines also need push anything fact york times denied error rocket engines particularly simple sometimes consisting nothing catalyst case hydrogen peroxide rocket43 makes attractive option vehicles packs despite simplicity rocket engines often dangerous susceptible explosions fuel flammable poisonous corrosive cryogenic also suffer poor efficiency reasons rocket engines used absolutely necessarycitation needed
electric motors used electric vehicles electric bicycles electric scooters small boats subways trains trolleybuses trams experimental aircraft electric motors efficient efficiency common44 electric motors also built powerful reliable lowmaintenance size electric motors deliver range speeds torques without necessarily using gearbox although economical electric motors limited chiefly difficulty supplying electricitycitation needed
compressed motors used vehicles experimentally simple efficient safe cheap reliable operate variety conditions difficulties using motors cooling effect expanding engines limited quickly absorb heat surroundings45 cooling effect however double conditioning compressed motors also lose effectiveness falling pressurecitation needed
thrusters used satellites spacecraft effective vacuum limits spaceborne vehicles thrusters primarily electricity also need propellant caesium recently xenon4647 thrusters achieve extremely high speeds little propellant however powerhungry48
converting energy workedit
mechanical energy motors engines produce must converted work wheels propellers nozzles similar means aside converting mechanical energy motion wheels allow vehicle roll along surface exception railed vehicles steered49 wheels ancient technology specimens discovered 5000 years ago50 wheels used plethora vehicles including motor vehicles armoured personnel carriers amphibious vehicles airplanes trains skateboards wheelbarrows
nozzles used conjunction almost reaction engines51 vehicles using nozzles include aircraft rockets personal watercraft nozzles take shape cone bell51 unorthodox designs created aerospike nozzles intangible electromagnetic field nozzle vectored thruster52
continuous track sometimes used instead wheels power land vehicles continuous track advantages larger contact area easy repairs small damage high maneuverability53 examples vehicles using continuous track tanks snowmobiles excavators continuous tracks used together allow steering largest vehicle world54 bagger propelled continuous tracks
propellers well screws fans rotors used move fluid propellers used toys since ancient times however leonardo vinci devised earliest propeller driven vehicles aerialscrew55 1661 toogood hays adopted screw ship propeller56 since propeller tested many terrestrial vehicles including schienenzeppelin train numerous cars57 modern times propellers prevalent watercraft aircraft well amphibious vehicles hovercraft ground effect vehicles intuitively propellers cannot work space working fluid however sources suggested since space never empty propeller could made work space58
similarly propeller vehicles vehicles wings propulsion sailboats sailplanes propelled forward component lift generated sailswings5960 ornithopters also produce thrust aerodynamically ornithopters large rounded leading edges produce lift leadingedge suction forces61
paddle wheels used older watercraft reconstructions ships known paddle steamers paddle wheels simply push water design construction simple oldest ship scheduled service skibladner62 many pedalo boats also paddle wheels propulsion
screwpropelled vehicles propelled augerlike cylinders fitted helical flanges produce thrust land water commonly used allterrain vehicles zil2906 sovietdesigned screwpropelled vehicle designed retrieve cosmonauts siberian wilderness63
frictionedit
almost useful energy produced engine usually dissipated friction minimising frictional losses important many vehicles main sources friction rolling friction fluid drag drag water drag
wheels bearing friction pneumatic tyres give rolling friction steel wheels steel tracks lower still64
aerodynamic drag reduced streamlined design features
friction desirable important supplying traction facilitate motion land land vehicles rely friction accelerating decelerating changing direction sudden reductions traction cause loss control accidents

legislationedit
motor vehicle trailer categories defined according following international classification73

category passenger vehicles
category motor vehicles carriage goods
category trailers semitrailers

european unionedit
european union classifications vehicle types defined by74

commission directive 2001116ec december 2001 adapting technical progress council directive 70156eec approximation laws member states relating typeapproval motor vehicles trailers75
directive 200224ec european parliament council march 2002 relating typeapproval three wheeled motor vehicles repealing council directive 9261eec

european community based communitys wvta whole vehicle typeapproval system system manufacturers obtain certification vehicle type member state meets technical requirements market euwide need tests total technical harmonization already achieved three vehicle categories passenger cars motorcycles tractors soon extend vehicle categories coaches utility vehicles essential european manufacturers ensured access large market possible
community typeapproval system allows manufacturers benefit fully internal market opportunities worldwide technical harmonization context united nations economic commission europe unece offers market beyond european borders
licensingedit
many cases unlawful operate vehicle without license certification least strict form regulation usually limits passengers driver carry prohibits completely canadian ultralight license without endorsements76 next level licensing allow passengers without form compensation payment private drivers license usually conditions commercial licenses allow transport passengers cargo tightly regulated strict form licensing generally reserved school buses hazardous materials transports emergency vehicles
driver motor vehicle typically required hold valid drivers license driving public lands whereas pilot aircraft must license times regardless jurisdiction aircraft flying
registrationedit
vehicles often required registered registration purely legal reasons insurance reasons help enforcement recover stolen vehicles toronto police service example offers free optional bicycle registration online77 motor vehicles registration often takes form vehicle registration plate makes easy identify vehicle russia trucks buses licence plate numbers repeated large black letters backcitation needed aircraft similar system used tail number painted various surfaces like motor vehicles aircraft watercraft also registration numbers jurisdictions however vessel name still primary means identification case since ancient times reason duplicate registration names generally rejected canada boats engine power greater require registration78 leading ubiquitous engine
registration conditional vehicle approved public highways case uk79 ontario80 many states also requirements vehicles operating public highways81 aircraft stringent requirements pose high risk damage people property event accident requires aircraft airworthiness certificate8283 aircraft must flown time certified84 provision experimental airworthiness certificate85 experimental aircraft restricted operation including overflights populated areas busy airspace unessential passengers84 materials parts used certified aircraft must meet criteria forth technical standard orders86
