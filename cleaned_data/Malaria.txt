signs symptoms




main symptoms malaria12


signs symptoms malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection12 however symptoms occur later taken antimalarial medications prevention5 initial manifestations disease—common malaria species—are similar flulike symptoms13 resemble conditions sepsis gastroenteritis viral diseases5 presentation include headache fever shivering joint pain vomiting hemolytic anemia jaundice hemoglobin urine retinal damage convulsions14
classic symptom malaria paroxysm—a cyclical occurrence sudden coldness followed shivering fever sweating occurring every days tertian fever vivax ovale infections every three days quartan fever malariae falciparum infection cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours less pronounced almost continuous fever15
severe malaria usually caused falciparum often referred falciparum malaria symptoms falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days infection13 individuals cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms including abnormal posturing nystagmus conjugate gaze palsy failure eyes turn together direction opisthotonus seizures coma13
complications
malaria several serious complications among development respiratory distress occurs adults children severe falciparum malaria possible causes include respiratory compensation metabolic acidosis noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema concomitant pneumonia severe anaemia although rare young children severe malaria acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs 5–25 adults pregnant women16 coinfection malaria increases mortality17 renal failure feature blackwater fever hemoglobin lysed blood cells leaks urine13
infection falciparum result cerebral malaria form severe malaria involves encephalopathy associated retinal whitening useful clinical sign distinguishing malaria causes fever18 enlarged spleen enlarged liver severe headache blood sugar hemoglobin urine renal failure occur13 complications include spontaneous bleeding coagulopathy shock19
malaria pregnant women important cause stillbirths infant mortality abortion birth weight20 particularly falciparum infection also vivax21
cause
main article plasmodium
malaria parasites belong genus plasmodium phylum apicomplexa humans malaria caused falciparum malariae ovale vivax knowlesi2223 among infected falciparum common species identified followed vivax although falciparum traditionally accounts majority deaths24 recent evidence suggests vivax malaria associated potentially lifethreatening conditions often diagnosis falciparum infection25 vivax proportionally common outside africa26 documented human infections several species plasmodium higher apes however except knowlesi—a zoonotic species causes malaria macaques23—these mostly limited public health importance27
global warming likely affect malaria transmission severity geographic distribution effects uncertain2829
life cycle




life cycle malaria parasites mosquito causes infection bite first sporozoites enter bloodstream migrate liver infect liver cells multiply merozoites rupture liver cells return bloodstream merozoites infect blood cells develop ring forms trophozoites schizonts turn produce merozoites sexual forms also produced taken mosquito infect insect continue life cycle


life cycle plasmodium female anopheles mosquito definitive host transmits motile infective form called sporozoite vertebrate host human secondary host thus acting transmission vector sporozoite travels blood vessels liver cells hepatocytes reproduces asexually tissue schizogony producing thousands merozoites infect blood cells initiate series asexual multiplication cycles blood schizogony produce infective merozoites point cells burst infective cycle begins anew30
merozoites develop immature gametocytes precursors male female gametes fertilized mosquito bites infected person gametocytes taken blood mature mosquito male female gametocytes fuse form ookinete—a fertilized motile zygote ookinetes develop sporozoites migrate insects salivary glands ready infect vertebrate host sporozoites injected skin saliva mosquito takes subsequent blood meal31
female mosquitoes feed blood male mosquitoes feed plant nectar transmit disease females anopheles genus mosquito prefer feed night usually start searching meal dusk continue throughout night taking meal32 malaria parasites also transmitted blood transfusions although rare33
recurrent malaria
symptoms malaria recur varying symptomfree periods depending upon cause recurrence classified either recrudescence relapse reinfection recrudescence symptoms return symptomfree period caused parasites surviving blood result inadequate ineffective treatment34 relapse symptoms reappear parasites eliminated blood persist dormant hypnozoites liver cells relapse commonly occurs 8–24 weeks commonly seen vivax ovale infections5 vivax malaria cases temperate areas often involve overwintering hypnozoites relapses beginning year mosquito bite35 reinfection means parasite caused past infection eliminated body parasite introduced reinfection cannot readily distinguished recrudescence although recurrence infection within weeks treatment initial infection typically attributed treatment failure36 people develop immunity exposed frequent infections37

malaria infection develops phases involves liver exoerythrocytic phase involves blood cells erythrocytes erythrocytic phase infected mosquito pierces persons skin take blood meal sporozoites mosquitos saliva enter bloodstream migrate liver infect hepatocytes multiplying asexually asymptomatically period 8–30 days38
potential dormant period liver organisms differentiate yield thousands merozoites following rupture host cells escape blood infect blood cells begin erythrocytic stage life cycle38 parasite escapes liver undetected wrapping cell membrane infected host liver cell39
within blood cells parasites multiply asexually periodically breaking host cells invade fresh blood cells several amplification cycles occur thus classical descriptions waves fever arise simultaneous waves merozoites escaping infecting blood cells38
vivax sporozoites immediately develop exoerythrocyticphase merozoites instead produce hypnozoites remain dormant periods ranging several months 7–10 months typical several years period dormancy reactivate produce merozoites hypnozoites responsible long incubation late relapses vivax infections35 although existence ovale uncertain40
parasite relatively protected attack bodys immune system human life cycle resides within liver blood cells relatively invisible immune surveillance however circulating infected blood cells destroyed spleen avoid fate falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins surface infected blood cells causing blood cells stick walls small blood vessels thereby sequestering parasite passage general circulation spleen41 blockage microvasculature causes symptoms placental malaria42 sequestered blood cells breach blood–brain barrier cause cerebral malaria43
genetic resistance
main article human genetic resistance malaria
according 2005 review high levels mortality morbidity caused malaria—especially falciparum species—it placed greatest selective pressure human genome recent history several genetic factors provide resistance including sickle cell trait thalassaemia traits glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency absence duffy antigens blood cells4445
impact sickle cell trait malaria immunity illustrates evolutionary tradeoffs occurred endemic malaria sickle cell trait causes change hemoglobin molecule blood normally blood cells flexible biconcave shape allows move narrow capillaries however modified hemoglobin molecules exposed amounts oxygen crowd together dehydration stick together forming strands cause cell sickle distort curved shape strands molecule effective taking releasing oxygen cell flexible enough circulate freely early stages malaria parasite cause infected cells sickle removed circulation sooner reduces frequency malaria parasites complete life cycle cell individuals homozygous copies abnormal hemoglobin beta allele sicklecell anaemia heterozygous abnormal allele normal allele experience resistance malaria without severe anemia although shorter life expectancy homozygous condition would tend disfavor traits survival trait preserved malariaprone regions benefits provided heterozygous form4546
