roughly percentagepoint increase rate unemployment 2007 2013 percentage point result cyclical weakness demand goods services percentage point arose structural factors factors chiefly stigma workers face erosion skills stem longterm unemployment together worth onehalf percentage point increase unemployment rate decrease efficiency employers filling vacancies probably least part result mismatches skills locations also worth onehalf percentage point increase unemployment rate
