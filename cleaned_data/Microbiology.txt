microbiology greek μῑκρος mīkros small βίος bios life λογία logia study microorganisms unicellular single cell multicellular cell colony acellular lacking cells1 microbiology encompasses numerous subdisciplines including virology parasitology mycology bacteriology
eukaryotic microorganisms possess membranebound cell organelles include fungi protists whereas prokaryotic organisms—all microorganisms—are conventionally classified lacking membranebound organelles include eubacteria archaebacteria microbiologists traditionally relied culture staining microscopy however less microorganisms present common environments cultured isolation using current means2 microbiologists often rely molecular biology tools sequence based identification example rrna gene sequence used bacteria identification
viruses variably classified organisms3 considered either simple microorganisms complex molecules prions never considered microorganisms investigated virologists however clinical effects traced originally presumed chronic viral infections virologists took search—discovering infectious proteins
existence microorganisms predicted many centuries first observed example jains india marcus terentius varro ancient rome first recorded microscope observation fruiting bodies moulds robert hooke 1666 jesuit priest athanasius kircher likely first microbes mentioned observing milk putrid material 1658 antonie leeuwenhoek considered father microbiology observed experimented microscopic organisms 1676 using simple microscopes design scientific microbiology developed 19th century work louis pasteur medical microbiology robert koch

avicenna hypothesized existence microorganisms


existence microorganisms hypothesized many centuries actual discovery existence unseen microbiological life postulated jainism based mahavira’s teachings early century bce4 paul dundas notes mahavira asserted existence unseen microbiological creatures living earth water fire5 jain scriptures describe nigodas submicroscopic creatures living large clusters short life said pervade every part universe even tissues plants flesh animals6 roman marcus terentius varro made references microbes warned locating homestead vicinity swamps bred certain minute creatures cannot seen eyes float enter body mouth nose thereby cause serious diseases7
golden islamic civilization scientists hypothesized existence microorganisms avicenna book canon medicine zuhr also known avenzoar discovered scabies mites alrazi gave earliest known description smallpox book virtuous life alhawi8
1546 girolamo fracastoro proposed epidemic diseases caused transferable seedlike entities could transmit infection direct indirect contact vehicle transmission9

1676 antonie leeuwenhoek lived life delft holland observed bacteria microorganisms using singlelens microscope design141 considered father microbiology pioneered simple singlelensed microscopes design14 leeuwenhoek often cited first observe microbes robert hooke made first recorded microscopic observation fruiting bodies moulds 166515 however suggested jesuit priest called athanasius kircher first observe microorganisms16
kircher among first design magic lanterns projection purposes must well acquainted properties lenses16 wrote concerning wonderful structure things nature investigated microscope 1646 stating would believe vinegar milk abound innumerable multitude worms also noted putrid material full innumerable creeping animalcules published scrutinium pestis examination plague 1658 stating correctly disease caused microbes though likely white blood cells rather plague agent itself16
