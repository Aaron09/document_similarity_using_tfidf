postulatesedit



reflections type made clear long shortly 1900 shortly plancks trailblazing work neither mechanics electrodynamics could except limiting cases claim exact validity gradually despaired possibility discovering true laws means constructive efforts based known facts longer desperately tried came conviction discovery universal formal principle could lead assured results could universal principle found



albert einstein autobiographical notes12


einstein discerned fundamental propositions seemed assured regardless exact validity known laws either mechanics electrodynamics propositions constancy speed light independence physical laws especially constancy speed light choice inertial system initial presentation special relativity 1905 expressed postulates

principle relativity laws states physical systems undergo change affected whether changes state referred systems uniform translatory motion relative other1
principle invariant light speed light always propagated empty space definite velocity speed independent state motion emitting body preface1 light vacuum propagates speed fixed constant independent direction least system inertial coordinates stationary system regardless state motion light source

derivation special relativity depends explicit postulates also several tacit assumptions made almost theories physics including isotropy homogeneity space independence measuring rods clocks past history13
following einsteins original presentation special relativity 1905 many different sets postulates proposed various alternative derivations14 however common postulates remains employed einstein original paper mathematical statement principle relativity made later einstein introduces concept simplicity mentioned

special principle relativity system coordinates chosen relation physical laws hold good simplest form laws hold good relation system coordinates moving uniform translation relatively

henri poincaré provided mathematical framework relativity theory proving lorentz transformations subset poincaré group symmetry transformations einstein later derived transformations axioms
many einsteins papers present derivations lorentz transformation based upon principles16
einstein consistently based derivation lorentz invariance essential core special relativity basic principles relativity lightspeed invariance wrote

insight fundamental special theory relativity assumptions relativity light speed invariance compatible relations type lorentz transformation postulated conversion coordinates times events universal principle special theory relativity contained postulate laws physics invariant respect lorentz transformations transition inertial system arbitrarily chosen inertial system restricting principle natural laws12

thus many modern treatments special relativity base single postulate universal lorentz covariance equivalently single postulate minkowski spacetime1718
principle relativity alone without assuming constancy speed light using isotropy space symmetry implied principle special relativity show spacetime transformations inertial frames either euclidean galilean lorentzian lorentzian case obtain relativistic interval conservation certain finite limiting speed experiments suggest speed speed light vacuum1920
constancy speed light motivated maxwells theory electromagnetism lack evidence luminiferous ether conflicting evidence extent einstein influenced null result michelson–morley experiment2122 case null result michelson–morley experiment helped notion constancy speed light gain widespread rapid acceptance
lack absolute reference frameedit
principle relativity states physical laws form inertial reference frame dates back galileo incorporated newtonian physics however late 19th century existence electromagnetic waves physicists suggest universe filled substance called aether would medium waves vibrations travelled aether thought constitute absolute reference frame speeds could measured could considered fixed motionless aether supposedly possessed wonderful properties sufficiently elastic support electromagnetic waves waves could interact matter offered resistance bodies passing results various experiments including michelson–morley experiment theory special relativity showing aether23 einsteins solution discard notion aether absolute state rest relativity reference frame moving uniform motion observe laws physics particular speed light vacuum always measured even measured multiple systems moving different constant velocities
reference frames coordinates lorentz transformationedit
reference frames relative motionedit




primed system motion relative unprimed system constant velocity along xaxis perspective observer stationary unprimed system principle relativity observer stationary primed system view likewise construction except velocity record changing speed propagation interaction infinite nonrelativistic mechanics finite value require modification transformation equations mapping events frame another


reference frames play crucial role relativity theory term reference frame used observational perspective space undergoing change motion acceleration position measured along spatial axes addition reference frame ability determine measurements time events using clock reference device uniform periodicity
event occurrence assigned single unique time location space relative reference frame point spacetime since speed light constant relativity every reference frame pulses light used unambiguously measure distances refer back times events occurred clock even though light takes time reach clock event transpired
example explosion firecracker considered event completely specify event four spacetime coordinates time occurrence 3dimensional spatial location define reference point lets call reference frame
relativity theory often want calculate position point different reference point
suppose second reference frame whose spatial axes clock exactly coincide time zero moving constant velocity respect along xaxis
since absolute reference frame relativity theory concept moving doesnt strictly exist everything always moving respect reference frame instead frames move speed direction said comoving therefore comoving

said scientists make fundamental distinction measurement observation hand versus visual appearance sees
