relation heat temperatureedit
discovery laws thermodynamics quantity energy transferred heat measured changes states participating bodies
general rules important exceptions indicated noted following paragraphs section stated follows
bodies temperature ranges expand heated mostly heating body constant volume increases pressure exerts constraining walls increases temperature also mostly heating body constant pressure increases volume increases temperature
beyond substances three ordinarily recognized states matter solid liquid fourth less obviously recognized plasma many finely differentiated states matter example glass liquid crystal many cases fixed temperature pressure substance exist several distinct states matter might viewed body example float glass water water said constitute phases within body definite rules known telling distinct phases coexist body mostly fixed pressure definite temperature heating causes solid melt evaporate definite temperature heating causes liquid evaporate cases cooling reverse effects
commonest cases rule heating measured changes state body cases supply called thermometric bodies allow definition empirical temperatures 1848 temperatures defined thus tight link apparently logically determined heat temperature though recognized conceptually thoroughly distinct especially joseph black later eighteenth century
important exceptions break obviously apparent link heat temperature make clear empirical definitions temperature contingent peculiar properties particular thermometric substances thus precluded title absolute example water contracts heated near cannot used thermometric substance near temperature also certain temperature range contracts heating moreover many substances exist metastable states negative pressure survive transiently special conditions facts sometimes called anomalous reasons thermodynamic definition absolute temperature
