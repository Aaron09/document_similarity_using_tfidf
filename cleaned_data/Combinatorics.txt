combinatorics area mathematics primarily concerned counting means obtaining results certain properties finite structures closely related many areas mathematics many applications ranging logic statistical physics evolutionary biology computer science
fully understand scope combinatorics requires great deal amplification details universally agreed upon1 according ryser definition subject difficult crosses many mathematical subdivisions2 area described types problems addresses combinatorics involved

enumeration counting specified structures sometimes referred arrangements configurations general sense associated finite systems
existence structures satisfy certain given criteria
construction structures perhaps many ways
optimization finding best structure solution among several possibilities largest smallest satisfying optimality criterion

leon mirsky said combinatorics range linked studies something common diverge widely objectives methods degree coherence attained3 define combinatorics perhaps describe subdivisions problems techniques approach used however also purely historical reasons including including topics combinatorics umbrella4 although primarily concerned finite systems combinatorial questions techniques extended infinite specifically countable discrete setting
combinatorics well known breadth problems tackles combinatorial problems arise many areas pure mathematics notably algebra probability theory topology geometry5 well many application areas many combinatorial questions historically considered isolation giving solution problem arising mathematical context later twentieth century however powerful general theoretical methods developed making combinatorics independent branch mathematics right6 oldest accessible parts combinatorics graph theory numerous natural connections areas combinatorics used frequently computer science obtain formulas estimates analysis algorithms
