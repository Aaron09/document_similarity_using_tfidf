market structuresedit
economics idea monopoly important study management structures directly concerns normative aspects economic competition provides basis topics industrial organization economics regulation four basic types market structures traditional economic analysis perfect competition monopolistic competition oligopoly monopoly monopoly structure single supplier produces sells given product single seller certain market close substitutes product market structure pure monopoly sometimes many sellers industry andor exist many close substitutes goods produced nevertheless companies retain market power termed monopolistic competition whereas oligopoly companies interact strategically

profit maximizer maximizes profits
price maker decides price good product sold determining quantity order demand price desired firm
high barriers sellers unable enter market monopoly
single seller monopoly seller good produces output5 therefore whole market served single company practical purposes company industry
price discrimination monopolist change price quantity product sells higher quantities lower price elastic market sells lower quantities higher price less elastic market

sources monopoly poweredit
monopolies derive market power barriers entry circumstances prevent greatly impede potential competitors ability compete market three major types barriers entry economic legal deliberate6

economic barriers economic barriers include economies scale capital requirements cost advantages technological superiority7
economies scale decreasing unit costs larger volumes production8 decreasing costs coupled large initial costs often large fixed costs give monopolies advantage wouldbe competitors monopolies often position reduce prices entrants operating costs thereby prevent competing8 thus size industry relative minimum efficient scale limit number companies effectively compete within industry example industry large enough support company minimum efficient scale companies entering industry operate size less cannot produce average cost competitive dominant company finally longterm average cost constantly decreasingclarification needed least cost method provide good service single company9
capital requirements production processes require large investments capital perhaps form large research development costs substantial sunk costs limit number companies industry10 example economies scale
technological superiority monopoly better able acquire integrate best possible technology producing goods entrants either expertise unable meet large fixed costs needed efficient technology8 thus large company often produce goods cheaper several small companies11
substitute goods monopoly sells good close substitute absence substitutes makes demand good relatively inelastic enabling monopolies extract positive profits
control natural resources prime source monopoly power control resources materials critical production final good
network externalities product person affect value product people network effect direct relationship proportion people using product demand product words people using product greater probability another individual start product reflects fads fashion trends12 social networks also play crucial role development acquisition market power famous current example market dominance microsoft office suite operating system personal computerscitation needed
legal barriers legal rights provide opportunity monopolise market good intellectual property rights including patents copyrights give monopolist exclusive control production selling certain goods property rights give company exclusive control materials necessary produce good
manipulation company wanting monopolise market engage various types deliberate action exclude competitors eliminate competition actions include collusion lobbying governmental authorities force anticompetitive practices

addition barriers entry competition barriers exit source market power barriers exit market conditions make difficult expensive company involvement market high liquidation costs primary barrier exiting13 market exit shutdown sometimes separate events decision whether shut operate affected exit barrierscitation needed company shut price falls minimum average variable costs
monopoly versus competitive marketsedit
monopoly perfect competition mark extremes market structures14 similarity cost functions same15 monopolies perfectly competitive companies minimize cost maximize profit shutdown decisions assumed perfectly competitive factors markets distinctions important distinctions follows

marginal revenue price perfectly competitive market price equals marginal cost monopolistic market however price marginal cost16
product differentiation zero product differentiation perfectly competitive market every product perfectly homogeneous perfect substitute monopoly great absolute product differentiation sense available substitute monopolized good monopolist sole supplier good question17 customer either buys monopolizing entity terms without
number competitors markets populated infinite number buyers sellers monopoly involves single seller17
barriers entry barriers entry factors circumstances prevent entry market wouldbe competitors limit companies operating expanding within market markets free entry exit barriers entry exit competition monopolies relatively high barriers entry barriers must strong enough prevent discourage potential competitor entering market
elasticity demand price elasticity demand percentage change demand caused percent change relative price successful monopoly would relatively inelastic demand curve coefficient elasticity indicative effective barriers entry company perfectly elastic demand curve coefficient elasticity perfectly competitive demand curve infinitecitation needed
excess profits excess positive profits profit normal expected return investment company make excess profits short term excess profits attract competitors enter market freely decrease prices eventually reducing excess profits zero18 monopoly preserve excess profits barriers entry prevent competitors entering market19
profit maximization company maximizes profits producing price equals marginal costs monopoly maximises profits producing marginal revenue equals marginal costs20 rules equivalent demand curve company perfectly elastic flat demand curve identical average revenue curve price line since average revenue curve constant marginal revenue curve also constant equals demand curve average revenue price thus price line also identical demand curve
pmax quantity price profit monopolist obtains control formerly perfectly competitive industry monopolist would increase prices reduce production realise positive economic profits21
supply curve perfectly competitive market well defined supply function onetoone relationship price quantity supplied22 monopolistic market supply relationship exists monopolist cannot trace short term supply curve given price unique quantity supplied pindyck rubenfeld note change demand lead changes prices change output changes output change price both23 monopolies produce marginal revenue equals marginal costs specific demand curve supply curve would pricequantity combination point marginal revenue equals marginal cost demand curve shifted marginal revenue curve would shift well equilibrium supply point would established locus points would supply curve conventional sense2425

significant distinction company monopoly monopoly downwardsloping demand curve rather perceived perfectly elastic curve company26 practically variations mentioned relate fact downwardsloping demand curve necessity distinct marginal revenue curve implications fact best made manifest linear demand curve assume inverse demand curve form total revenue curve marginal revenue curve thus several things evident first marginal revenue curve intercept inverse demand curve second slope marginal revenue curve twice inverse demand curve third intercept marginal revenue curve half inverse demand curve quite evident marginal revenue curve inverse demand curve points26 since companies maximise profits equating must case profitmaximizing quantity less price implies monopoly produces less quantity higher price market perfectly competitive
fact monopoly downwardsloping demand curve means relationship total revenue output monopoly much different competitive companies27 total revenue equals price times quantity competitive company perfectly elastic demand curve meaning total revenue proportional output27 thus total revenue curve competitive company slope equal market price27 competitive company sell output desires market price monopoly increase sales must reduce price thus total revenue curve monopoly parabola begins origin reaches maximum value continuously decreases total revenue zero28 total revenue maximum value slope total revenue function zero slope total revenue function marginal revenue revenue maximizing quantity price occur example assume monopoly’s demand function total revenue function would marginal revenue would setting marginal revenue equal zero

revenue maximizing quantity monopoly units revenue maximizing price
company monopoly experience price pressure competitors although experience pricing pressure potential competition company increases prices much others enter market able provide good substitute lesser price29 idea monopolies markets easy entry need regulated known revolution monopoly theory30
monopolist extract premiumclarification needed getting complementary markets total profits monopolist could earn sought leverage monopoly market monopolizing complementary market equal extra profits could earn anyway charging monopoly product however monopoly profit theorem true customers monopoly good stranded poorly informed tied good high fixed costs
pure monopoly economic rationality perfectly competitive companies optimise profit function given constraints assumptions increasing marginal costs exogenous inputs prices control concentrated single agent entrepreneur optimal decision equate marginal cost marginal revenue production nonetheless pure monopoly unlike competitive company alter market price convenience decrease production results higher price economics jargon said pure monopolies downwardsloping demand important consequence behaviour worth noticing typically monopoly selects higher price lesser quantity output pricetaking company less available higher price31

price elasticity demand firm faces32 markup rules indicate ratio profit margin price inversely proportional price elasticity demand32 implication rule elastic demand product less pricing power monopoly
market poweredit
market power ability increase products price marginal cost without losing customers33 perfectly competitive companies zero market power comes setting prices companies market price takers price interaction demand supply market aggregate level individual companies simply take price determined market produce quantity output maximizes companys profits company attempted increase prices market level customers would abandon company purchase market price companies monopoly considerable although unlimited market power monopoly power prices quantities although both34 monopoly price maker35 monopoly market36 prices monopolist based circumstances interaction demand supply primary factors determining monopoly market power companys demand curve cost structure37
market power ability affect terms conditions exchange price product single company price imposed market perfect competition3839 although monopolys market power great still limited demand side market monopoly negatively sloped demand curve perfectly inelastic curve consequently price increase result loss customers
price discriminationedit
price discrimination allows monopolist increase profit charging higher prices identical goods willing able example economic textbooks cost united states developing countries like ethiopia case publisher using governmentgranted copyright monopoly price discriminate generally wealthier american economics students generally poorer ethiopian economics students similarly patented medications cost countries presumed poorer customer base typically high general price listed various market segments varying discounts example framing make process charging people higher prices socially acceptablecitation needed perfect price discrimination would allow monopolist charge customer exact maximum amount would willing would allow monopolist extract consumer surplus market perfect price discrimination theoretical construct advances information technology micromarketing bring closer realm possibility
important realize partial price discrimination cause customers inappropriately pooled high price customers excluded market example poor student might excluded purchasing economics textbook price student able purchase ethiopian price similarly wealthy student ethiopia able willing price though naturally would hide fact monopolist reduced third world price deadweight losses decrease monopolists profits monopolists substantial economic interest improving market information market segmentingcitation needed
important information remember considering monopoly model diagram associated conclusions displayed result monopoly prices higher production output lesser competitive company follow requirement monopoly charge different prices different customers monopoly restricted engaging price discrimination termed first degree price discrimination customers charged amount monopoly permitted charge individualised prices termed third degree price discrimination quantity produced price charged marginal customer would identical competitive company thus eliminating deadweight loss however gains trade social welfare would accrue monopolist none consumer essence every consumer would indifferent going completely without product service able purchase monopolistcitation needed
long price elasticity demand customers less absolute value advantageous company increase prices receives money fewer goods price increase price elasticity tends increase optimum case greater customerscitation needed
company maximizes profit selling marginal revenue equals marginal cost company engage price discrimination charge profit maximizing price customers circumstances customers would willing higher price would lower price price discrimination strategy charge less price sensitive buyers higher price price sensitive buyers lower price40 thus additional revenue generated sources basic problem identify customers willingness
purpose price discrimination transfer consumer surplus producer41 consumer surplus difference value good consumer price consumer must market purchase it42 price discrimination limited monopolies
market power company’s ability increase prices without losing customers company market power engage price discrimination perfect competition market form price discrimination would impossible perfectly competitive company perfectly elastic demand curve zero market power41434445
three forms price discrimination first degree price discrimination charges consumer maximum price consumer willing second degree price discrimination involves quantity discounts third degree price discrimination involves grouping consumers according willingness measured price elasticities demand charging group different price third degree price discrimination prevalent typecitation needed
three conditions must present company engage successful price discrimination first company must market power46 second company must able sort customers according willingness good47 third firm must able prevent resell
company must degree market power practice price discrimination without market power company cannot charge market price48 market structure characterized downward sloping demand curve market power monopoly monopolistic competition oligopoly46 market structure market power perfect competition48
company wishing practice price discrimination must able prevent middlemen brokers acquiring consumer surplus company accomplishes preventing limiting resale many methods used prevent resale example persons required show photographic identification boarding pass boarding airplane travelers assume practice strictly matter security however primary purpose requesting photographic identification confirm ticket purchaser person board airplane someone repurchased ticket discount buyercitation needed
inability prevent resale largest obstacle successful price discrimination43 companies however developed numerous methods prevent resale example universities require students show identification entering sporting events governments make illegal resale tickets products boston baseball tickets resold legally team
three basic forms price discrimination first second third degree price discrimination first degree price discrimination company charges maximum price customer willing maximum price consumer willing unit good reservation price thus unit seller tries price equal consumer’s reservation price49 direct information consumer’s willingness rarely available sellers tend rely secondary information person lives postal codes example catalog retailers mail highpriced catalogs highincome postal codes5051 first degree price discrimination frequently occurs regard professional services transactions involving direct buyerseller negotiations example accountant prepared consumers return information used charge customers based estimate ability pay52
second degree price discrimination quantity discrimination customers charged different prices based much single price schedule consumers prices vary depending quantity good bought53 theory second degree price discrimination consumer willing certain quantity good given price companies know consumer’s willingness decreases units purchasedcitation needed task seller identify price points reduce price reached hope reduced price trigger additional purchases consumer example sell unit blocks rather individual units
third degree price discrimination multimarket price discrimination54 seller divides consumers different groups according willingness measured price elasticity demand group consumers effectively becomes separate market demand curve marginal revenue curve44 firm attempts maximize profits segment equating mc465556 generally company charges higher price group price inelastic demand relatively lesser price group elastic demand57 examples third degree price discrimination abound airlines charge higher prices business travelers vacation travelers reasoning demand curve vacation traveler relatively elastic demand curve business traveler relatively inelastic determinant price elasticity demand used segment markets example seniors elastic demand movies young adults generally free time thus theaters offer discount tickets seniors58
exampleedit
assume uniform pricing system monopolist would sell five units price unit assume marginal cost unit total revenue would total costs would profits would monopolist practiced price discrimination would sell first unit second unit total revenue would total cost would profit would 1250059 several things worth noting monopolist acquires consumer surplus eliminates practically deadweight loss willing sell anyone willing least marginal cost59 thus price discrimination promotes efficiency secondly pricing scheme price average revenue equals marginal revenue monopolist behaving like perfectly competitive company60 thirdly discriminating monopolist produces larger quantity monopolist operating uniform pricing scheme61
