aviation term altitude several meanings always qualified explicitly adding modifier true altitude implicitly context communication parties exchanging altitude information must clear definition used1
aviation altitude measured using either mean level local ground level ground level reference datum
pressure altitude divided feet flight level used transition altitude 18000 feet 5500 3000 feet jurisdictions altimeter reads 18000 standard pressure setting aircraft said flight level flying flight level altimeter always standard pressure 2992 inhg 101325
flight deck definitive instrument measuring altitude pressure altimeter aneroid barometer front face indicating distance feet metres instead atmospheric pressure
several types aviation altitude

indicated altitude reading altimeter local barometric pressure mean level aviation radiotelephony usage vertical distance level point object considered point measured mean level referred radio altitudesee qnh2
absolute altitude height aircraft terrain flying measured using radar altimeter absolute altimeter1 also referred radar height feetmetres ground level
true altitude actual elevation mean level indicated altitude corrected nonstandard temperature pressure
height elevation ground reference point commonly terrain elevation aviation radiotelephony usage vertical distance level point object considered point measured specified datum referred radio height specified datum airfield elevation qfe2
pressure altitude elevation standard datum airpressure plane typically 101325 millibars 2992 pressure altitude used indicate flight level standard altitude reporting class airspace roughly 18000 feet pressure altitude indicated altitude altimeter setting 2992 101325 millibars
density altitude altitude corrected nonisa international standard atmosphere atmospheric conditions aircraft performance depends density altitude affected barometric pressure humidity temperature density altitude airport especially high elevation high preclude takeoff particularly helicopters heavily loaded aircraft

types altitude explained simply various ways measuring altitude

indicated altitude altitude shown altimeter
absolute altitude altitude terms distance ground directly
true altitude altitude terms elevation level
height altitude terms distance certain point
pressure altitude pressure terms altitude international standard atmosphere
density altitude density terms altitude international standard atmosphere

atmospheric studiesedit

earths atmosphere divided several altitude regions regions start finish varying heights depending season distance poles altitudes stated averages3

troposphere surface 8000 metres poles 18000 metres equator ending tropopause
stratosphere troposphere kilometres
mesosphere stratosphere kilometres
thermosphere mesosphere kilometres
exosphere thermosphere 10000 kilometres 6200

high altitude pressureedit

high altitude atmospheric pressure lower level competing physical effects gravity causes close possible ground heat content causes molecules bounce expand8
temperature profileedit
temperature profile atmosphere result interaction radiation convection sunlight visible spectrum hits ground heats ground heats surface radiation transfer heat ground space greenhouse effect gases atmosphere would keep ground roughly temperature would decay exponentially height9
however tends expand lowers density thus tends rise transfer heat upward process convection convection comes equilibrium parcel given altitude density surroundings poor conductor heat parcel rise fall without exchanging heat known adiabatic process characteristic pressuretemperature curve pressure gets lower temperature decreases rate decrease temperature elevation known adiabatic lapse rate approximately kilometer 1000 feet altitude9

athletesedit
athletes high altitude produces contradictory effects performance explosive events sprints metres long jump triple jump reduction atmospheric pressure signifies less atmospheric resistance generally results improved athletic performance23 endurance events races 5000 metres predominant effect reduction oxygen generally reduces athletes performance high altitude sports organizations acknowledge effects altitude performance international association athletic federations iaaf example marks record performances achieved altitude greater 1000 metres 3300 letter
athletes also take advantage altitude acclimatization increase performance changes help body cope high altitude increase performance back level2526 changes basis altitude training forms integral part training athletes number endurance sports including track field distance running triathlon cycling swimming

decreased oxygen availability decreased temperature make life high altitude challenging despite environmental conditions many species successfully adapted high altitudes animals developed physiological adaptations enhance oxygen uptake delivery tissues used sustain metabolism strategies used animals adapt high altitude depend morphology phylogeny example small mammals face challenge maintaining body heat cold temperatures small volume surface area ratio oxygen used source metabolic heat production hypobaric hypoxia high altitudes problematic
also general trend smaller body sizes lower species richness high altitudes likely lower oxygen partial pressures27 factors decrease productivity high altitude habitats meaning less energy available consumption growth activity28
