ancient medieval viewsedit
earliest recorded western philosophy time expounded ancient egyptian thinker ptahhotep 2650–2600 said

follow desire long live perform ordered lessen time following desire wasting time abomination spirit
11th maxim ptahhotep

vedas earliest texts indian philosophy hindu philosophy dating back late millennium describe ancient hindu cosmology universe goes repeated cycles creation destruction rebirth cycle lasting 4320000 years2 ancient greek philosophers including parmenides heraclitus wrote essays nature time3
incas regarded space time single concept named pacha quechua pacha aymara pacha456
plato timaeus identified time period motion heavenly bodies space things come aristotle book physics defined time number changes respect place object innermost motionless boundary surrounds
book augustines confessions ruminates nature time asking time asks know wish explain asketh know goes comment difficulty thinking time pointing inaccuracy common speech things speak properly things speak improperly still things intended understood augustine presented first philosophical argument reality creation aristotle context discussion time saying knowledge time depends knowledge movement things therefore time cannot creatures measure passing confessions book city book
contrast ancient greek philosophers believed universe infinite past beginning medieval philosophers theologians developed concept universe finite past beginning known temporal finitism christian philosopher john philoponus presented early arguments adopted later christian philosophers theologians form argument impossibility existence actual infinite states8

actual infinite cannot exist
infinite temporal regress events actual infinite
infinite temporal regress events cannot exist

early 11th century muslim physicist alhaytham alhacen alhazen discussed space perception epistemological implications book optics 1021 also rejected aristotles definition topos physics geometric demonstrations defined place mathematical spatial extension9 experimental proof intromission model vision changes understanding visual perception space contrary previous emission theory vision supported euclid ptolemy tying visual perception space prior bodily experience alhacen unequivocally rejected intuitiveness spatial perception therefore autonomy vision without tangible notions distance size correlation sight tell next nothing things10
realism antirealismedit
traditional realist position ontology time space existence apart human mind idealists contrast deny doubt existence objects independent mind antirealists whose ontological position objects outside mind exist nevertheless doubt independent existence time space
1781 immanuel kant published critique pure reason influential works history philosophy space time describes time priori notion together priori notions space allows comprehend sense experience kant denies either space time substance entities learned experience holds rather elements systematic framework structure experience spatial measurements used quantify apart objects temporal measurements used quantitatively compare interval duration events although space time held transcendentally ideal sense also empirically real—that mere illusions
idealist writers mctaggart unreality time argued time illusion also flow time
writers discussed part realists regard instance gottfried leibniz held monads existed least independently mind observer
absolutism relationalismedit
leibniz newtonedit
great debate defining notions space time real objects absolute mere orderings upon actual objects relational began physicists isaac newton spokesman samuel clarke gottfried leibniz papers leibniz–clarke correspondence
arguing absolutist position leibniz offers number thought experiments purpose showing contradiction assuming existence facts absolute location velocity arguments trade heavily principles central philosophy principle sufficient reason identity indiscernibles principle sufficient reason holds every fact reason sufficient explain otherwise identity indiscernibles states telling entities apart thing
example leibniz uses involves proposed universes situated absolute space discernible difference latter positioned five feet left first example possible thing absolute space exists situation however possible according leibniz universes position absolute space would sufficient reason might well anywhere else therefore contradicts principle sufficient reason could exist distinct universes ways indiscernible thus contradicting identity indiscernibles
standing clarkes newtons response leibnizs arguments bucket argument water bucket hung rope spin start flat surface water begins spin bucket surface water become concave bucket stopped water continue spin spin continues surface remain concave concave surface apparently result interaction bucket water since surface flat bucket first starts spin becomes concave water starts spin remains concave bucket stops
response clarke argues necessity existence absolute space account phenomena like rotation acceleration cannot accounted purely relationalist account clarke argues since curvature water occurs rotating bucket well stationary bucket containing spinning water explained stating water rotating relation presence third thing—absolute space
leibniz describes space exists relation objects existence apart existence objects motion exists relation objects newtonian space provided absolute frame reference within objects motion newtons system frame reference exists independently objects contained within objects described moving relation space many centuries evidence concave water surface held authority
machedit
another important figure debate 19thcentury physicist ernst mach deny existence phenomena like seen bucket argument still denied absolutist conclusion offering different answer bucket rotating relation fixed stars
mach suggested thought experiments like bucket argument problematic imagine universe contains bucket newtons account bucket could spin relative absolute space water contained would form characteristic concave surface absence anything else universe would difficult confirm bucket indeed spinning seems equally possible surface water bucket would remain flat
mach argued effect water experiment otherwise empty universe would remain flat another object introduced universe perhaps distant star would something relative bucket could seen rotating water inside bucket could possibly slight curve account curve observe increase number objects universe also increases curvature water mach argued momentum object whether angular linear exists result effects objects universe machs principle
einsteinedit
albert einstein proposed laws physics based principle relativity principle holds rules physics must observers regardless frame reference used light propagates speed reference frames theory motivated maxwells equations show electromagnetic waves propagate vacuum speed light however maxwells equations give indication speed relative prior einstein thought speed relative fixed medium called luminiferous ether contrast theory special relativity postulates light propagates speed light inertial frames examines implications postulate
attempts measure speed relative ether failed seen confirmation einsteins postulate light propagates speed reference frames special relativity formalization principle relativity contain privileged inertial frame reference luminiferous ether absolute space einstein inferred frame exists
einstein generalized relativity frames reference noninertial achieved positing equivalence principle states force felt observer given gravitational field felt observer accelerating frame reference indistinguishable conclusion mass object warps geometry spacetime surrounding described einsteins field equations
classical physics inertial reference frame object experiences forces accelerate general relativity inertial frame reference following geodesic spacetime object moves geodesic experiences force object free fall experience force following geodesic object standing earth however experience force held geodesic surface planet light bucket water rotating empty space experience force rotates respect geodesic water become concave rotating respect distant stars rotating respect geodesic
einstein partially advocates machs principle distant stars explain inertia provide gravitational field acceleration inertia occur contrary leibnizs account warped spacetime integral part object defining characteristics volume mass holds contrary idealist beliefs objects exist independently mind seems relativistics commits also hold space temporality exactly type independent existence
conventionalismedit
position conventionalism states fact matter geometry space time decided convention first proponent view henri poincaré reacting creation noneuclidean geometry argued geometry applied space decided convention since different geometries describe objects equally well based considerations sphereworld
view developed updated include considerations relativistic physics hans reichenbach reichenbachs conventionalism applying space time focuses around idea coordinative definition
coordinative definition major features first coordinating units length certain physical objects motivated fact never directly apprehend length instead must choose physical object standard metre bureau international poids mesures international bureau weights measures wavelength cadmium stand unit length second feature deals separated objects although presumably directly test equality length measuring rods next another find much rods distant another even supposing rods whenever brought near another seen equal length justified stating always equal length impossibility undermines ability decide equality length distant objects sameness length contrary must definition
coordinative definition effect reichenbachs conventionalism general theory relativity light assumed discovered mark equal distances equal times setting coordinative definition however geometry spacetime
absolutismrelationalism debate contemporary philosophy still disagreement correctness conventionalist doctrine

building insights historical debates absolutism conventionalism well reflecting import technical apparatus general theory relativity details structure spacetime made large proportion discussion within philosophy space time well philosophy physics following short list topics
relativity simultaneityedit
according special relativity point universe different events compose present instant used rietdijk–putnam argument demonstrate relativity predicts block universe events fixed four dimensionscitation needed
invariance covarianceedit
bringing bear lessons absolutismrelationalism debate powerful mathematical tools invented 19th 20th century michael friedman draws distinction invariance upon mathematical transformation covariance upon transformation
invariance symmetry applies objects symmetry group spacetime theory designates features objects invariant absolute dynamical variable
covariance applies formulations theories covariance group designates range coordinate systems laws physics hold
distinction illustrated revisiting leibnizs thought experiment universe shifted five feet example position object seen property object location invariant similarly covariance group classical mechanics coordinate systems obtained another shifts position well translations allowed galilean transformation
classical case invariance symmetry group covariance group coincide interestingly enough part ways relativistic physics symmetry group general theory relativity includes differentiable transformations properties object dynamical words absolute objects formulations general theory relativity unlike classical mechanics share standard single formulation paired transformations covariance group general theory relativity covariance group every theory
historical frameworksedit
application modern mathematical methods league idea invariance covariance groups interpret historical views space time modern mathematical language
translations theory space time seen manifold paired vector spaces vector spaces facts objects theory historical development spacetime theories generally seen start position many facts objects incorporated theory history progresses structure removed
example aristotelian space time absolute position special places center cosmos circumference newtonian space time absolute position galilean invariant special positions
holesedit
general theory relativity traditional debate absolutism relationalism shifted whether spacetime substance since general theory relativity largely rules existence absolute positions powerful argument spacetime substantivalism offered john earman known hole argument
technical mathematical argument paraphrased follows
define function identity function elements manifold excepting small neighbourhood belonging comes differ identity smooth function
function construct mathematical models second generated applying proper elements first models identical prior time time function created foliation spacetime differ
considerations show since substantivalism allows construction holes universe must view indeterministic earman argues case substantivalism case determinism indeterminism question physics commitment substantivalism
direction timeedit
problem direction time arises directly contradictory facts firstly fundamental physical laws timereversal invariant cinematographic film taken process describable means aforementioned laws played backwards would still portray physically possible process secondly experience time macroscopic level timereversal invariant11 glasses fall break shards glass cannot reassemble onto tables memories past none future feel cant change past influence future
causation solutionedit
solution problem takes metaphysical view direction time follows asymmetry causation know past elements past causes effect perception feel cant affect past affect future cant affect past affect future
main objections view first problem distinguishing cause effect nonarbitrary causation constructing temporal ordering could easily become circular second problem view explanatory power causation account successful account timeasymmetric phenomena like perception action account many others
however asymmetry causation observed nonarbitrary metaphysical case human hand dropping water smashes fragments hard floor spilling liquid order causes resultant pattern fragments water spill easily attributable terms trajectory irregularities structure angle impact floor however applying event reverse difficult explain various pieces human hand reassemble precisely shape water position entirely within causes resultant structure shape encapsulation water hand within easily attributable neither hand floor achieve formations water asymmetry perceivable account features relationship agent capacities human hand capable nonanimal agency floors capable pieces came possess exactly nature number assembling short asymmetry attributable relationship temporal direction hand implications form functional capacity
application ideas form functional capacity dictates temporal direction relation complex scenarios involving specific nonmetaphysical agency merely dependent human perception time however last observation sufficient invalidate implications example progressive nature time general
thermodynamics solutionedit
second major family solutions problem generated literature finds existence direction time relating nature thermodynamics
answer classical thermodynamics states basic physical theory fact timereversal symmetric thermodynamics particular second thermodynamics states entropy closed system never decreases explains often glass breaking coming back together
statistical mechanics things become complicated hand statistical mechanics superior classical thermodynamics thermodynamic behavior glass breaking explained fundamental laws physics paired statistical postulate statistical mechanics unlike classical thermodynamics timereversal symmetric second thermodynamics arises statistical mechanics merely states overwhelmingly likely entropy increase absolute
current thermodynamic solutions problem direction time find fact feature laws nature account discrepancy
laws solutionedit
third type solution problem direction time although much less represented argues laws timereversal symmetric example certain processes quantum mechanics relating weak nuclear force timereversible keeping mind dealing quantum mechanics timereversibility comprises complex definition type solution insufficient timeasymmetric phenomena quantum mechanics account uniformity macroscopic timeasymmetry relies assumption quantum mechanics final correct description physical processescitation needed
recent proponent laws solution maudlin argues fundamental laws physics laws temporal evolution maudlin 2007 however elsewhere maudlin argues passage time intrinsic asymmetry temporal structure world asymmetry grounds distinction sequences runs past future sequences future past ibid 2010 edition thus arguably difficult assess whether maudlin suggesting direction time consequence laws primitive
flow timeedit
problem flow time treated analytic philosophy owes beginning paper written mctaggart paper mctaggart proposes temporal series first series means account intuitions temporal becoming moving called aseries aseries orders events according past present future simpliciter comparison bseries eliminates reference present associated temporal modalities past future orders events temporal relations earlier later
mctaggart paper unreality time argues time unreal since aseries inconsistent bseries alone cannot account nature time aseries describes essential feature
building framework camps solution offered first atheorist solution takes becoming central feature time tries construct bseries aseries offering account bfacts come afacts second camp btheorist solution takes decisive mctaggarts arguments aseries tries construct aseries bseries example temporal indexicals
dualitiesedit

quantum field theory models shown possible theories different spacetime backgrounds like adscft tduality equivalent
presentism eternalismedit
main articles presentism philosophy time eternalism philosophy time
according presentism time ordering various realities certain time things exist others reality deal cannot example homer exists present time eternalist hand holds time dimension reality three spatial dimensions hence things—past present future—can said real things present according theory homer really exist though must still special language talking somebody exists distant time—just would special language talking something away words near directly comparable phrases past minute
endurantism perdurantismedit
main articles endurantism perdurantism
positions persistence objects somewhat similar endurantist holds object persist time exist completely different times instance existence regard somehow separate previous future instances though still numerically identical perdurantist hand holds thing exist time exist continuous reality consider thing whole must consider aggregate temporal parts instances existing endurantism seen conventional view flows prephilosophical ideas talk somebody think talking person complete object part crosstemporal perdurantists attacked position example perdurantist david lewis argument perdurantists state superiority view perdurantism able take account change objects
relations questions mean whole presentists also endurantists eternalists also perdurantists vice versa necessary connection possible claim instance times passage indicates series ordered realities objects within realities somehow exist outside reality whole even though realities wholes related however positions rarely adopted
