jurisdictions notably united states prevalent many countries prevent parties relitigating facts appeal history unscrupulous lawyers deliberately reserving issues order ambush appellate courts invited error problem idea efficient force parties fully litigate relevant issues fact trial court thus party raise issue fact trial court level generally cannot raise appeal
lawsuit finally resolved allotted time appeal expired matter judicata meaning plaintiff bring another action based claim addition parties later attempt relitigate matter already ruled previous lawsuit estopped
