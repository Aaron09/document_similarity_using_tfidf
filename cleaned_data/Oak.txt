hybridization




hybrid white possibly quercus stellata muhlenbergii


interspecific hybridization quite common among oaks usually species within section common white group subgenus quercus section quercus list quercus species intersection hybrids except species sections quercus mesobalanus unknown recent systematic studies appear confirm high tendency quercus species hybridize combination factors white oaks unable discriminate pollination species section wind pollinated weak internal barriers hybridization hybridization produces functional seeds fertile hybrid offspring6 ecological stresses especially near habitat margins also cause breakdown mate recognition well reduction male function pollen quantity quality parent species67
frequent hybridization among oaks consequences populations around world notably hybridization produced large populations hybrids copious amounts introgression evolution species8 frequent hybridization high levels introgression caused different species populations share genetic information9 high rates hybridization introgression produces genetic data often differentiate clearly morphologically distinct species instead differentiates populations10 numerous hypotheses proposed explain species able remain morphologically ecologically distinct high levels gene flow phenomenon still largely mystery botanists
fagaceae beech family oaks belong slow evolving clade compared angiosperms1112 patterns hybridization introgression quercus pose great challenge concept species since species often defined group “actually potentially interbreeding populations reproductively isolated groups”13 definition many species quercus would lumped together according geographic ecological habitat despite clear distinctions morphology large extent genetic data
