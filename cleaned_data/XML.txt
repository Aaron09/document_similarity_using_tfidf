applications xmledit
essence extensible markup languages necessary explained markup language example markup language standard generalized markup language
hundreds document formats using syntax developed7 including atom soap xhtml xmlbased formats become default many officeproductivity tools including microsoft office office open openofficeorg libreoffice opendocument apples iworkcitation needed also provided base language communication protocols xmpp applications microsoft framework files configuration apple implementation registry based xml8
industry data standards fpml mismo based rich features schema specification many standards quite complex uncommon specification comprise several thousand pages
publishing dita industry data standard used extensively underpin various publishing formats
widely used services oriented architecture disparate systems communicate exchanging messages message exchange format standardised schema also referred canonical schema
come common interchange data internet ietf rfc3023 superseded rfc7303 gave rules construction internet media types sending also defines media types applicationxml textxml data nothing semantics textxml criticizedi potential source encoding problems suggested deprecated9
7303 also recommends xmlbased languages given media types ending example imagesvgxml
guidelines networked context appear 3470 also known ietf document covering many aspects designing deploying xmlbased language
terminologyedit
material section based specification exhaustive list constructs appear provides introduction constructs often encountered daytoday

character
document string characters almost every legal unicode character appear document


processor application
processor analyzes markup passes structured information application specification places requirements processor must application outside scope processor specification calls often referred colloquially parser


markup content
characters making document divided markup content distinguished application simple syntactic rules generally strings constitute markup either begin character begin character strings characters markup content however cdata section delimiters cdata classified markup text classified content addition whitespace outermost element classified markup



markup construct begins ends tags come three flavors

starttag section
endtag section
emptyelement linebreak




element
element logical document component either begins starttag ends matching endtag consists emptyelement characters starttag endtag elements content contain markup including elements called child elements example greetinghello worldgreeting another linebreak


attribute
attribute markup construct consisting name–value pair exists within starttag emptyelement example srcmadonnajpg altmadonna names attributes values madonnajpg madonna respectively another example step number3connect bstep name attribute number value attribute single value attribute appear element common situation list multiple values desired must done encoding list wellformed attributeii format beyond defines usually either comma semicolon delimited list individual values known contain spacesiii spacedelimited list used classinner greetingboxwelcomediv attribute class value inner greetingbox also indicates class names inner greetingbox


declaration
documents begin declaration describes information example version10 encodingutf8

characters escapingedit
documents consist entirely characters unicode repertoire except small number specifically excluded control characters character defined unicode appear within content document
includes facilities identifying encoding unicode characters make document expressing characters reason another cannot used directly
valid charactersedit
main article valid characters
unicode code points following ranges valid documents10

u0009 horizontal u000a line feed u000d carriage return controls accepted
u0020–ud7ff ue000–ufffd excludes noncharacters surrogates ufffe uffff forbidden
u10000–u10ffff includes code points supplementary planes including noncharacters

1111 extends allowed characters include plus remaining characters range u0001–u001f time however restricts control characters u0009 horizontal u000a line feed u000d carriage return u0085 next line requiring written escaped form example u0001 must written equivalent case characters restriction backwards incompatibility introduced allow common encoding errors detected
code point u0000 null character permitted document
encoding detectionedit
unicode character encoded bytes storage transmission variety different ways called encodings unicode defines encodings cover entire repertoire wellknown ones include utf8 utf1612 many text encodings predate unicode ascii isoiec 8859 character repertoires almost every case subsets unicode character
allows unicodedefined encodings encodings whose characters also appear unicode also provides mechanism whereby processor reliably without prior knowledge determine encoding used13 encodings utf8 utf16 necessarily recognized every parser
escapingedit
provides escape facilities including characters problematic include directly example

characters syntax markers never appear content outside cdata section allowed recommended entity values14
character encodings support subset unicode example legal encode document ascii ascii lacks code points unicode characters
might possible type character authors machine
characters glyphs cannot visually distinguished characters nonbreaking space space cyrillic capital letter x410 latin capital letter

five predefined entities

represents
represents
represents
apos represents
quot represents

permitted unicode characters represented numeric character reference consider chinese character whose numeric code unicode hexadecimal 4e2d decimal 20013 user whose keyboard offers method entering character could still insert document encoded either 20013 x4e2d similarly string jörg could encoded inclusion document jxf6rg
permitted however null character control characters excluded even using numeric character reference15 alternative encoding mechanism base64 needed represent characters
commentsedit
comments appear anywhere document outside markup comments cannot appear declaration comments begin compatibility sgml string doublehyphen allowed inside comments16 means comments cannot nested ampersand special significance within comments entity character references recognized represent characters outside character document encoding
example valid comment need escape code comments
international useedit



example contains armenian text without proper rendering support question marks boxes symbols instead armenian letters





example contains cyrillic text without proper rendering support question marks boxes misplaced vowels missing conjuncts instead cyrillic letters


fifth edition support direct almost unicode character element names attributes comments character data processing instructions ones special symbolic meaning lessthan sign following wellformed document including chinese armenian cyrillic characters


version10 encodingutf8

wellformedness errorhandlingedit
main article wellformed document
specification defines document wellformed text meaning satisfies list syntax rules provided specification points fairly lengthy list include

document contains properly encoded legal unicode characters
none special syntax characters appear except performing markupdelineation roles
starttag endtag emptyelement delimit elements correctly nested none missing none overlapping
names casesensitive starttag endtag must match exactly
names cannot contain characters space character cannot begin numeric digit
single root element contains elements

definition document excludes texts contain violations wellformedness rules simply processor encounters violation required report errors cease normal processing policy occasionally referred draconian error handling stands notable contrast behavior programs process html designed produce reasonable result even presence severe markup errors17 xmls policy area criticized violation postels conservative send liberal accept18
specification defines valid document wellformed document also conforms rules document type definition dtd1920
schemas validationedit
addition wellformed document valid means contains reference document type definition elements attributes declared follow grammatical rules specifies
processors classified validating nonvalidating depending whether check documents validity processor discovers validity error must able report continue normal processing
example schema grammar since initial publication substantial work area schema languages schema languages typically constrain elements used document attributes applied order appear allowable parentchild relationships
document type definitionedit
main article document type definition
oldest schema language document type definition inherited sgml
dtds following benefits

support ubiquitous inclusion standard
dtds terse compared elementbased schema languages consequently present information single screen
dtds allow declaration standard public entity sets publishing characters
dtds define document type rather types used namespace thus grouping constraints document single collection

dtds following limitations

explicit support newer features importantly namespaces
lack expressiveness dtds simpler sgml dtds certain structures cannot expressed regular grammars dtds support rudimentary datatypes
lack readability designers typically make heavy parameter entities behave essentially textual macros make easier define complex grammars expense clarity
syntax based regular expression syntax inherited sgml describe schema typical apis attempt offer applications structured representation syntax less accessible programmers elementbased syntax

peculiar features distinguish dtds schema types syntactic support embedding within documents defining entities arbitrary fragments text andor markup processor inserts document wherever referenced like character escapes
technology still used many applications ubiquity
schemaedit
main article schema
newer schema language described successor dtds schema often referred initialism schema instances schema definition xsds powerful dtds describing languages rich datatyping system allow detailed constraints documents logical structure xsds also xmlbased format makes possible ordinary tools help process
xsschema element defines schema


version10 encodingiso88591

schematronedit
schematron language making assertions presence absence patterns document typically uses xpath expressions schematron standard part rulebased validation isoiec 19757 dsdl

related specificationsedit
cluster specifications closely related developed starting soon initial publication frequently case term used refer together technologies come seen part core

namespaces enable document contain elements attributes taken different vocabularies without naming collisions occurring although namespaces part specification virtually software also supports namespaces
base defines xmlbase attribute used base resolution relative references within scope single element
information infoset abstract data model documents terms information items infoset commonly used specifications languages convenience describing constraints constructs languages allow
extensible stylesheet language family languages used transform render documents split three parts




xslt transformations language transforming documents documents formats html plain text xslfo xslt tightly coupled xpath uses address components input document mainly elements attributes
xslfo formatting objects language rendering documents often used generate pdfs
xpath path language nonxml language addressing components elements attributes document xpath widely used corexml specifications programming libraries accessing xmlencoded data




xquery query query language strongly rooted xpath schema provides methods access manipulate return mainly conceived query language databases
signature defines syntax processing rules creating digital signatures content
encryption defines syntax processing rules encrypting content
xmlmodel part schema association isoiec 19757 dsdl defines means associating document schema types mentioned

specifications conceived part core failed find wide adoption including xinclude xlink xpointer
programming interfacesedit
design goals include shall easy write programs process documents5 despite specification contains almost information programmers might processing infoset specification provides vocabulary refer constructs within document provide guidance access information variety apis accessing developed used standardized
existing apis processing tend fall categories

streamoriented apis accessible programming language example stax
treetraversal apis accessible programming language example
data binding provides automated translation document programminglanguage objects
declarative transformation languages xslt xquery
syntax extensions generalpurpose programming languages example linq scala

streamoriented facilities require less memory certain tasks based linear traversal document faster simpler alternatives treetraversal databinding apis typically require much memory often found convenient programmers include declarative retrieval document components xpath expressions
xslt designed declarative description document transformations widely implemented serverside packages browsers xquery overlaps xslt functionality designed searching large databases
simple xmledit
main article simple
simple lexical eventdriven document read serially contents reported callbacks various methods handler object users design fast efficient implement difficult extracting information random since tends burden application author keeping track part document processed better suited situations certain types information always handled matter occur document
pull parsingedit
pull parsing21 treats document series items read sequence using iterator design pattern allows writing recursive descent parsers structure code performing parsing mirrors structure parsed intermediate parsed results used accessed local variables within methods performing parsing passed method parameters lowerlevel methods returned method return values higherlevel methods examples pull parsers include stax java programming language xmlpullparser smalltalk xmlreader elementtreeiterparse python systemxmlxmlreader framework traversal nodeiterator treewalker
pull parser creates iterator sequentially visits various elements attributes data document code uses iterator test current item tell example whether starttag endtag text inspect attributes local name namespace values attributes value text also move iterator next item code thus extract information document traverses recursivedescent approach tends lend keeping data typed local variables code parsing instance typically requires parser manually maintain intermediate data within stack elements parent elements element parsed pullparsing code straightforward understand maintain parsing code
document object modeledit
main article document object model
document object model allows navigation entire document tree node objects representing documents contents document created parser generated manually users limitations data types nodes abstract implementations provide programming languagespecific bindings implementations tend memory intensive generally require entire document loaded memory constructed tree objects access allowed
data bindingedit
data binding binding documents hierarchy custom strongly typed objects contrast generic objects created parser approach simplifies code development many cases allows problems identified compile time rather runtime suitable applications document structure known fixed time application written example data binding systems include java architecture binding jaxb serialization framework22 serialization gsoap
