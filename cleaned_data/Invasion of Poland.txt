several common misconceptions regarding polish september campaign
combat polish cavalry german tanksedit
polish army fight german tanks horsemounted cavalry wielding lances swords 1939 polish army made cavalry units117 polish cavalry never charged german tanks entrenched infantry artillery usually acted mobile infantry like dragoons reconnaissance units executed cavalry charges rare situations foot soldiers armies including german soviet also fielded extensively used elite horse cavalry units time polish cavalry consisted eleven brigades emphasized military doctrine equipped anti tank rifles light artillery highly effective bofors antitank myth originated correspondents reports similar battle krojanty polish cavalry brigade fired upon ambush hidden armored vehicles mounted successful sabrecharge german infantry also cases polish cavalry dashing tanks trying break encirclement gave impression attacknote 7118
polish forceedit
polish force destroyed ground first days though numerically inferior moved bases small camouflaged airfields shortly trainers auxiliary aircraft destroyed ground polish force significantly outnumbered fighters outmatched advanced german fighters remained active second week campaign inflicting significant damage luftwaffe119 luftwaffe lost aircraft operational causes damaged poles lost aircraft120
polish resistance invasionedit
common false belief poland offered little resistance surrendered quickly first days germany sustained heavy losses poland cost germans tanks armored vehicles campaign losses tanks never recovered121122 thousands soldiers strength123 duration september campaign lasted week half less battle france 1940 even though anglofrench forces much closer parity germans numerical strength equipmentnote furthermore polish army preparing romanian bridgehead would prolonged polish defence plan cancelled soviet invasion poland september 1939124 poland also never officially surrendered germans german occupation several guerilla troops continued fight henryk dobrzańskis guerilla troops organised armia krajowa underground organisations forest partisans leśni

first blitzkrieg strategyedit
often assumed blitzkrieg strategy germany first used poland ideas blitzkrieg mobile warfare already used spain china siberia many early postwar histories barrie pitts second world publishing 1966 attribute german victory enormous development military technique occurred 1918 1940 cite germany translated british interwar theories action called result blitzkrieg idea repudiated authors matthew cooper writes

throughout polish campaign employment mechanized units revealed idea intended solely ease advance support activities infantry thus strategic exploitation armoured idea stillborn paralysis command breakdown morale made ultimate german ground forces incidental byproducts traditional manoeuvers rapid encirclement supporting activities flying artillery luftwaffe purpose physical destruction enemy troops vernichtungsgedanke polish campaign
cooper125

vernichtungsgedanke strategy dating back frederick great applied polish campaign little changed french campaigns 1870 1914 tanks

left much desired… fear enemy action flanks advance fear prove disastrous german prospects west 1940 soviet union 1941 present beginning
cooper52

john ellis writing brute force asserted

considerable justice matthew coopers assertion panzer divisions given kind strategic mission characterize authentic armoured blitzkrieg almost always closely subordinated various mass infantry armies
ellis126 emphasis original

zaloga madej polish campaign 1939 also address subject mythical interpretations blitzkrieg importance arms campaign western accounts september campaign stressed shock value panzers stuka attacks

tended underestimate punishing effect german artillery polish units mobile available significant quantity artillery shattered many units branch wehrmacht
