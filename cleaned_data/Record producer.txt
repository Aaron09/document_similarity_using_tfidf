historyedit
beginning record industry producer role technically limited record shot artists performing live4
role producers changed progressively 1950s 1960s technological developments development multitrack recording caused major change recording process multitracking elements song lead vocals backup vocals rhythm section instrument accompaniment solos orchestral parts performed simultaneously singers musicians assembled large studio performance recorded multitrack recording tracks rhythm section accompaniment parts bassline drums rhythm guitar could recorded first vocals solos could added later using many takes attempts took well song used instruments longer necessary players studio time band could record backing tracks week horn section could brought week later horn shots punches string section could brought week
facilitated recording process allow multiple takes multitrack recording another profound effect music production enabled producers audio engineers create sounds would impossible live performance style ordering examples include psychedelic rock sound effects 1960s playing back sound recorded instruments backward changing tape produce unique sound effects period instruments popular music began shift acoustic instruments traditional music piano upright bass bass acoustic guitar electric piano electronic organ synthesizer electric bass electric guitar instruments electric electronic thus used instrument amplifiers speaker enclosures speaker cabinets create sound
electric electronic instruments amplifiers enabled performers producers change tone sound instruments produce unique electric sounds would impossible achieve acoustic instruments live performers singer backup vocals guitarist play layers backing parts solo7
technologies like multitracking changed goal recording producer could blend together multiple takes edit together different sections create desired sound example jazz fusion bandleadercomposer miles davis album bitches brew producer edited sections together extensive improvisation sessions




phil spector producing modern folk quartet 1966


producers like phil spector george martin soon creating recordings practical terms almost impossible realize live performance producers became creative figures studio examples engineers includes meek macero brian wilson biddu8




brian wilson mixing board brother studios 1976


another related phenomenon 1960s emergence performerproducer acts like beatles rolling stones beach boys kinks gained expertise studio recording techniques many groups eventually took frequently uncredited producers work many recordings acts rolling stones kinks officially credited various producers time number performers since asserted many recordings period either wholly selfproduced rolling stones decca recordings collaborations group recording engineer small faces immediate recordings made olympic studios engineer glyn johnsnb
beach boys probably best example trend artists becoming producers within years bands commercial breakthrough group leader brian wilson taken father murry sole producer recordings 1963 1967 alongside beatles martin wilson also pioneered many production innovations 1964 developed spectors techniques level sophistication using multiple studios multiple takes instrumental vocal components capture best possible combinations sound performance using tape editing extensively assemble perfect composite performance elements
20th century digital recording producing tools widespread availability relatively affordable computers music software made music producing accessible
equipment technologyedit




mixing console


numerous technologies utilized record producers modernday recordings recording mixing tasks commonly centralized within computers using digital audio workstations tools logic ableton cubase studio often used third party virtual studio technology plugins9 logic tools considered industry standard daws1011 however also main mixer outboard effects gear midi controllers recording device
music production done using sophisticated software musicians producers prefer minutiae older analog technology professor albin claims increased automation newer processes newer instruments reduces level control manipulation available musicians producers12
studio applicationedit
production changed drastically years advancing technology producers role changed always seen jack trades duties require broad knowledge recording process13
trackingedit
