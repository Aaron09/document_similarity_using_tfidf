guido rossum creator python


main article history python
python conceived late 1980s30 implementation began december 198931 guido rossum centrum wiskunde informatica netherlands successor language inspired setl32 capable exception handling interfacing amoeba operating system6 rossum remains pythons principal author continuing central role pythons development reflected title given python community benevolent dictator life bdfl
origins python rossum wrote 199633



december 1989 looking hobby programming project would keep occupied week around christmas office would closed home computer much else hands decided write interpreter scripting language thinking lately descendant would appeal unixc hackers chose python working title project slightly irreverent mood monty pythons flying circus



python released october 2000 many major features including cycledetecting garbage collector support unicode release development process became transparent communitybacked34
python initially called python 3000 py3k released december 2008 long testing period major revision language backwardcompatible previous versions35 however many major features backported backwardcompatible python 26x36 version series
python endoflife date sunset date initially 2015 postponed 2020 concern large body existing code could easily forwardported python 33738 january 2017 google announced work python transcompiler register speculated response python planned endoflife39 google cited performance concurrent workloads motivation40
features philosophyedit
python multiparadigm programming language objectoriented programming structured programming fully supported many features support functional programming aspectoriented programming including metaprogramming41 metaobjects magic methods42 many paradigms supported extensions including design contract4344 logic programming45
python uses dynamic typing combination reference counting cycledetecting garbage collector memory management also features dynamic name resolution late binding binds method variable names program execution
pythons design offers support functional programming lisp tradition filter reduce functions list comprehensions dictionaries sets generator expressions46 standard library modules itertools functools implement functional tools borrowed haskell standard ml47
languages core philosophy summarized document python includes aphorisms as48

beautiful better ugly
explicit better implicit
simple better complex
complex better complicated
readability counts

rather functionality built core python designed highly extensible compact modularity made particularly popular means adding programmable interfaces existing applications rossums vision small core language large standard library easily extensible interpreter stemmed frustrations espoused opposite approach30
offering choice coding methodology python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax perl favor simpler lesscluttered grammar alex martelli describe something clever considered compliment python culture49 pythons philosophy rejects perl approach language design favor one—and preferably one—obvious it48
pythons developers strive avoid premature optimization reject patches noncritical parts cpython would offer marginal increases speed cost clarity50 speed important python programmer move timecritical functions extension modules written languages pypy justintime compiler cython also available translates python script makes direct clevel calls python interpreter
important goal pythons developers keeping reflected languages name—a tribute british comedy group monty python51—and occasionally playful approaches tutorials reference materials examples refer spam eggs famous monty python sketch instead standard bar5253
common neologism python community pythonic wide range meanings related program style code pythonic uses python idioms well natural shows fluency language conforms pythons minimalist philosophy emphasis readability contrast code difficult understand reads like rough transcription another programming language called unpythonic
users admirers python especially considered knowledgeable experienced often referred pythonists pythonistas pythoneers5455
syntax semanticsedit
main article python syntax semantics
python meant easily readable language formatting visually uncluttered often uses english keywords languages punctuation unlike many languages curly brackets delimit blocks semicolons statements optional fewer syntactic exceptions special cases pascal56
indentationedit
main article python syntax semantics indentation
python uses whitespace indentation rather curly braces keywords delimit blocks increase indentation comes certain statements decrease indentation signifies current block57 feature also sometimes termed offside rule
statements control flowedit
pythons statements include among others

assignment statement token equals sign operates differently traditional imperative programming languages fundamental mechanism including nature pythons version variables illuminates many features language assignment translates typed variable name receives copy numeric value righthand value copied allocated storage location lefthand variable name symbolic address memory allocated variable large enough potentially quite large declared type simplest case python assignment using example translates generic name receives reference separate dynamically allocated object numeric type value termed binding name object since names storage location doesnt contain indicated value improper call variable names subsequently rebound time objects greatly varying types including strings procedures complex objects data methods successive assignments common value multiple names result allocating storage three names numeric object three names bound since name generic reference holder unreasonable associate fixed data type however given time name bound object type thus dynamic typing
statement conditionally executes block code along else elif contraction elseif
statement iterates iterable object capturing element local variable attached block
statement executes block code long condition true
statement allows exceptions raised attached code block caught handled except clauses also ensures cleanup code finally block always regardless block exits
class statement executes block code attaches local namespace class objectoriented programming
statement defines function method
statement python encloses code block within context manager example acquiring lock block code releasing lock afterwards opening file closing allowing resource acquisition initialization raiilike behavior
pass statement serves syntactically needed create empty code block
assert statement used debugging check conditions ought apply
yield statement returns value generator function python yield also operator form used implement coroutines
import statement used import modules whose functions variables used current program ways using import module name import import module name
print statement changed print function python

python support tail call optimization firstclass continuations according guido rossum never will5960 however better support coroutinelike functionality provided extending pythons generators61 generators lazy iterators information passed unidirectionally generator python possible pass information back generator function python information passed multiple stack levels62
expressionsedit
python expressions similar languages java

addition subtraction multiplication behavior division differs types divisions python floor division integer division63 python also added operator exponentiation
python enables support matrix multiplication operator6465
python compares value versus java compares numerics value66 objects reference67 value comparisons java objects performed equals method pythons operator used compare object identities comparison reference python comparisons chained example
python uses words boolean operators rather symbolic used java
python type expression termed list comprehension python extended list comprehensions general expression termed generator expression46
anonymous functions implemented using lambda expressions however limited body expression
conditional expressions python written else different order operands operator common many languages
python makes distinction lists tuples lists written mutable cannot used keys dictionaries dictionary keys must immutable python tuples written immutable thus used keys dictionaries provided elements tuple immutable operator used concatenate tuples directly modify contents rather produces tuple containing elements provided tuples thus given variable initially equal executing first evaluates yields assigned back thereby effectively modifying contents conforming immutable nature tuple objects parentheses optional tuples unambiguous contexts69
python features sequence unpacking multiple expressions evaluating anything assigned variable writable property associated identical manner forming tuple literals whole left hand side equal sign assignment statement statement expects iterable object right hand side equal sign produces number values provided writable expressions iterated iterate assigning produced values corresponding expression leftcitation needed
python string format operator functions analogous printf format strings spams eggsd blah evaluates spamblah eggs2 python supplemented format method class spam0 eggs1formatblah python added fstrings fspamblah eggs270
python various kinds string literals

strings delimited single double quote marks unlike unix shells perl perlinfluenced languages single quote marks double quote marks function identically kinds string backslash escape character string interpolation became available python formatted string literals70
triplequoted strings begin series three single double quote marks span multiple lines function like documents shells perl ruby
string varieties denoted prefixing string literal escape sequences interpreted hence strings useful literal backslashes common regular expressions windowsstyle paths compare quoting


python array index array slicing expressions lists denoted akey astartstop astartstopstep indexes zerobased negative indexes relative slices take elements start index including stop index third slice parameter called step stride allows elements skipped reversed slice indexes omitted example returns copy entire list element slice shallow copy

python distinction expressions statements rigidly enforced contrast languages common lisp scheme ruby leads duplicating functionality example

list comprehensions forloops
conditional expressions blocks
eval exec builtin functions python exec statement former expressions latter statements

statements cannot part expression list comprehensions lambda expressions expressions cannot contain statements particular case assignment statement cannot form part conditional expression conditional statement advantage avoiding classic error mistaking assignment operator equality operator conditions syntactically valid probably unintended code causes syntax error python
methodsedit
methods objects functions attached objects class syntax instancemethodargument normal methods functions syntactic sugar classmethodinstance argument python methods explicit self parameter access instance data contrast implicit self objectoriented programming languages java objectivec ruby71
typingedit
python uses duck typing typed objects untyped variable names type constraints checked compile time rather operations object fail signifying given object suitable type despite dynamically typed python strongly typed forbidding operations welldefined example adding number string rather silently attempting make sense
python allows programmers define types using classes often used objectoriented programming instances classes constructed calling class example spamclass eggsclass classes instances metaclass type instance allowing metaprogramming reflection
version python kinds classes oldstyle newstyle72 syntax styles difference whether class object inherited directly indirectly newstyle classes inherit object instances type versions python python onwards kinds classes used oldstyle classes eliminated python
long term plan support gradual typing73 python syntax language allows specifying static types checked default implementation cpython experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compiletime type checking74

behavior division changed significantly time79

python earlier division behavior operator integer division operands integers floatingpoint division otherwise integer division rounds towards
python changes integer division round towards negative infinity floor division operator introduced adding future import division causes module python rules division next
python changes always floatingpoint division python terms pre30 classic division version30 real division floor division

rounding towards negative infinity though different languages adds consistency instance means equation always true also means equation valid positive negative values however maintaining validity equation means result expected halfopen interval positive integer interval negative80
python provides round function rounding float nearest integer tiebreaking versions roundawayfromzero round05 round05 −1081 python uses round even round15 round25
