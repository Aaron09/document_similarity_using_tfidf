early lifeedit
born town krasnoturinsk sverdlovsk oblast urals priest became interested natural sciences child father wanted alexander join priesthood sent seminary school yekaterinburg2 developed interest science mathematics instead going theology school 1877 enrolled petersburg university studied physics24 graduation honors 1882 stayed laboratory assistant university however salary university inadequate support family 1883 took post teacher head laboratory russian navys torpedo school kronstadt kotlin island2
popovs radio wave receiveredit




drawing popovs radio wave based lightning detector


along teaching duties naval school popov pursued related areas research trying solve problem failure electrical wire insulation steel ships turned problem electrical resonance explore oscillations high frequency electrical currents5 interest area study including field hertzian radio waves intensified trip 1893 chicago worlds columbian exposition united states able confer researchers field6
popov also read 1894 article british physicist oliver lodges experiments related discovery radio waves german physicist heinrich hertz years earlier6 june 1894 death hertz british physicist oliver lodge gave memorial lecture hertz experiments demonstration quasi optical nature hertzian waves radio waves demonstrated transmission distances meters7 lodge used detector called coherer glass tube containing metal filings electrodes4 received waves antenna applied electrodes coherer became conductive allowing current battery pass impulse picked mirror galvanometer receiving signal metal filings coherer reset manually operated vibrator vibrations bell placed table nearby rang every time transmission received7 popov work design sensitive radio wave receiver could used lightning detector warn thunderstorms detecting electromagnetic pulses lightning strikes1 using coherer receiver12
operating principleedit




circuit popovs lightning detector


popovs lightning detector coherer connected antenna separate circuit relay battery operated electric bell radio noise generated lightning strike turned coherer current battery applied relay closing contacts applied current electromagnet bell pulling ring bell popov added innovative automatic reset feature self tapping coherer bell would spring back coherer restoring receptive state3 chokes coherers leads prevented radio signal across coherer short circuiting passing circuit connected receiver wire antenna suspended high ground earth antenna idea based lightning early monopole wire aerial8

1895 popov presented paper relation metallic powders electric oscillations described lightning detector russian physical chemical society petersburg6 eastern sources regard popovs lightning detector first radio receiver9 celebrated since 1945 russian federation radio day2 however evidence popov sent type message occasion first account communication popov demonstration march 1896 physical chemical society accounts morse code message генрих герц heinrich hertz russian received transmitter meters away transcribed blackboard society president2 historian charles susskind 1962 concluded popov radio waves actual wireless communication mid18964
1895 italian inventor guglielmo marconi began work purpose built wireless telegraphy system based hertzian radio waves developing sparkgap transmitter much improved automaticallyreset coherer receiver mid1895 marconi transmitted messages mile 1600 meters came idea grounding transmitter well receiver mid1896 transmitting radio messages mile half 2400 meters10 popov marconis early work seems done without knowledge others system although reading marconi’s june 1896 patent disclosures popov develop long range wireless telegraphy system4




popovs receivers chart recorder white cylinder record lightning strikes


paper experiments relation metallic powders electrical oscillations published december 1895 apply patent invention3 july 1895 installed receiver siphon recorder roof institute forestry building petersburg1 able detect thunderstorms range however also aware communication potential paper read 1895 meeting concluded24

express hope apparatus applied signaling great distances electric vibrations high frequency soon invented powerful generator vibrations

1896 article depicting popovs invention reprinted journal russian physical chemical society march 1896 effected transmission radio waves different campus buildings petersburg november 1897 french entrepreneur eugene ducretet made transmitter receiver based wireless telegraphy laboratory according ducretet built devices using popovs lightning detector model 1898 ducretet manufacturing equipment wireless telegraphy based popovs instructions time popov effected shiptoshore communication distance miles 1898 miles 1899
