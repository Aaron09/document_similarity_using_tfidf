environmental effectsedit
main article environmental effects pesticides
pesticide raises number environmental concerns sprayed insecticides herbicides reach destination target species including nontarget species water soil40 pesticide drift occurs pesticides suspended particles carried wind areas potentially contaminating pesticides causes water pollution pesticides persistent organic pollutants contribute soil contamination
addition pesticide reduces biodiversity contributes pollinator decline44 destroys habitat especially birds45 threatens endangered species40
pests develop resistance pesticide pesticide resistance necessitating pesticide alternatively greater dose pesticide used counteract resistance although cause worsening ambient pollution problem
stockholm convention persistent organic pollutants listed dangerous persistent organic chemicals mostly obsolete organochlorine pesticides465 since chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides dissolve fats excreted organisms tend retain almost indefinitely biological magnification process whereby chlorinated hydrocarbons pesticides concentrated level food chain among marine animals pesticide concentrations higher carnivorous fishes even fisheating birds mammals ecological pyramid47 global distillation process whereby pesticides transported warmer colder regions earth particular poles mountain tops pesticides evaporate atmosphere relatively high temperature carried considerable distances thousands kilometers wind area lower temperature condense carried back ground rain snow48

push pull strategyedit
main article push–pull technology
term pushpull established 1987 approach integrated pest management strategy uses mixture behaviormodifying stimuli manipulate distribution abundance insects push means insects repelled deterred away whatever resource protected pull means certain stimuli semiochemical stimuli pheromones food additives visual stimuli genetically altered plants used attract pests trap crops killed59 numerous different components involved order implement pushpull strategy
many case studies testing effectiveness pushpull approach done across world successful pushpull strategy developed africa subsistence farming another successful case study performed control helicoverpa cotton crops australia europe middle east united states pushpull strategies successfully used controlling sitona lineatus bean fields59
