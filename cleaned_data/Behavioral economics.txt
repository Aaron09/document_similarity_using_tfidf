historyedit
classical period economics microeconomics closely linked psychology example adam smith wrote theory moral sentiments proposed psychological explanations individual behavior including concerns fairness justice8 jeremy bentham wrote extensively psychological underpinnings utility however development neoclassical economics economists sought reshape discipline natural science deducing economic behavior assumptions nature economic agents developed concept homo economicus whose psychology fundamentally rational
however many important neoclassical economists employed sophisticated psychological explanations including francis edgeworth vilfredo pareto irving fisher economic psychology emerged 20th century works gabriel tarde9 george katona10 laszlo garai11 expected utility discounted utility models began gain acceptance generating testable hypotheses decisionmaking given uncertainty intertemporal consumption respectively observed repeatable anomalies eventually challenged hypotheses steps taken nobel prizewinner maurice allais example setting allais paradox decision problem first presented 1953 contradicts expected utility hypothesis

prospect theoryedit
1979 kahneman tversky wrote prospect theory analysis decision risk used cognitive psychology explain various divergences economic decision making neoclassical theory14 prospect theory stages editing stage evaluation stage
editing stage risky situations simplified using various heuristics choice evaluation phase risky alternatives evaluated using various psychological principles include following

reference dependence evaluating outcomes decision maker mind reference level outcomes compared reference point classified gains greater reference point losses less reference point
loss aversion losses bite equivalent gains 1979 paper published econometrica kahneman tversky found median coefficient loss aversion losses bite times equivalent gainsverification needed
nonlinear probability weighting evidence indicates decision makers overweight small probabilities underweight large probabilities—this gives rise inverses shaped probability weighting function
diminishing sensitivity gains losses size gains losses relative reference point increase absolute value marginal effect decision makers utility satisfaction falls

prospect theory able explain everything main existing decision theories—expected utility theory rank dependent utility theory—can explain however converse false prospect theory used explain range phenomena existing decision theories great difficulty explaining include backward bending labor supply curves asymmetric price elasticities evasion comovement stock prices consumption
1992 journal risk uncertainty kahneman tversky gave revised account prospect theory called cumulative prospect theoryverification needed theory eliminated editing phase prospect theory focused evaluation phase main feature allowed nonlinear probability weighting cumulative manner originally suggested john quiggins rank dependent utility theory
psychological traits overconfidence projection bias effects limited attention part theory developments include conference university chicago15 special behavioral economics edition quarterly journal economics memory amos tversky kahnemans 2002 nobel prize integrated insights psychological research economic science especially concerning human judgment decisionmaking uncertainty16
intertemporal choiceedit
also time inconsistency
behavioral economics also applied intertemporal choice intertemporal choice defined making decision effects decision happening different time intertemporal choice behavior largely inconsistent exemplified george ainslies hyperbolic discounting—one prominently studied observations—and developed david laibson odonoghue matthew rabin hyperbolic discounting describes tendency discount outcomes near future outcomes future pattern discounting dynamically inconsistent timeinconsistent therefore inconsistent basic models rational choice since rate discount time time near future high time present time near future
pattern also explained models subadditive discounting distinguish delay interval discounting people less patient pertimeunit shorter intervals regardless occur

quantitative behavioral financeedit
quantitative behavioral finance uses mathematical statistical methodology understand behavioral biases marketing research study shows little evidence escalating biases impact marketing decisions32 leading contributors include gunduz caginalp editor journal behavioral finance 2001–04 collaborators include 2002 nobel laureate vernon smith david porter balenovich33 vladimira ilieva ahmet duran34 sturm35
financial modelsedit
financial models used money management asset valuation incorporate behavioral finance parameters examples

thalers model price reactions information three phases underreaction adjustment overreaction creating price trend


characteristic overreaction average returns following announcements good news lower following news words overreaction occurs market reacts strongly long news thus requiring adjustment opposite direction result outperforming assets period likely underperform following period also applies customers irrational purchasing habits36

game theoryedit
main article behavioral game theory
behavioral game theory invented colin camerer analyzes interactive strategic decisions behavior using methods game theory39 experimental economics experimental psychology experiments include testing deviations typical simplifications economic theory independence axiom40 neglect altruism41 fairness42 framing effects43 positive side method applied interactive learning44 social preferences45 research program subject development last three decades46
economic reasoning nonhuman animalsedit
handful comparative psychologists attempted demonstrate quasieconomic reasoning nonhuman animals early attempts along lines focus behavior rats pigeons studies draw tenets comparative psychology main goal discover analogs human behavior experimentallytractable nonhuman animals also methodologically similar work ferster skinner47 methodological similarities aside early researchers nonhuman economics deviate behaviorism terminology although studies primarily operant conditioning chamber using food rewards peckingbarpressing behavior researchers describe pecking barpressing terms reinforcement stimulusresponse relationships instead terms work demand budget labor recent studies adopted slightly different approach taking evolutionary perspective comparing economic behavior humans species nonhuman primate capuchin monkey48
nonhuman animal studiesedit
many early studies nonhuman economic reasoning performed rats pigeons operant conditioning chamber studies looked things like peck rate case pigeon barpressing rate case given certain conditions reward early researchers claim example response pattern peckingbarpressing rate appropriate analogy human labor supply49 researchers field advocate appropriateness using animal economic behavior understand elementary components human economic behavior50 paper battalio green kagel49 write

space considerations permit detailed discussion reasons economists take seriously investigation economic theories using nonhuman subjectsstudies economic behavior nonhuman animals provide laboratory identifying testing better understanding general laws economic behavior laboratory predicated fact behavior well structure vary continuously across species principles economic behavior would unique among behavioral principles apply variation course behavior nonhumans

labor supplyedit
typical laboratory environment study labor supply pigeons follows pigeons first deprived food since animals become hungry food becomes highly desired pigeons placed operant conditioning chamber orienting exploring environment chamber discover pecking small disk located side chamber food delivered effect pecking behavior becomes reinforced associated food long pigeon pecks disk stimulus regularly
circumstance pigeon said work food pecking food thought currency value currency adjusted several ways including amount food delivered rate food delivery type food delivered foods desirable others
economic behavior similar observed humans discovered hungry pigeons stop workingwork less reward reduced researchers argue similar labor supply behavior humans like humans even need work much given wage pigeons demonstrate decreases pecking work reward value reduced49
demandedit
human economics typical demand curve negative slope means price certain good increases amount consumers willing able purchase decreases researchers studying demand curves nonhuman animals rats also find downward slopes
researchers studied demand rats manner distinct studying labor supply pigeons specifically operant conditioning chamber containing rats experimental subjects require press instead pecking small disk receive reward reward food reward pellets water commodity drink cherry cola unlike previous pigeon studies work analog pecking monetary analog reward work analog experiment barpressing circumstances researchers claim changing number presses required obtain commodity item analogous changing price commodity item human economics51
effect results demand studies nonhuman animals show barpressing requirement cost increases number times animal presses equal greater barpressing requirement payment decreases
evolutionary psychologyedit
information evolutionary economics
evolutionary psychology perspective states many perceived limitations rational choice explained rational context maximizing biological fitness ancestral environment necessarily current thus living subsistence level reduction resources result death rational place greater value preventing losses obtaining gains also explain behavioral differences groups males less riskaverse females since males variable reproductive success females unsuccessful riskseeking limit reproductive success sexes males potentially increase reproductive success successful riskseeking much females can52
artificial intelligent machinesedit
