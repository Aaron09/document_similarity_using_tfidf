asexual reproduction ascomycetes characteristicsedit
ascomycetes
ascomycetes spore shooters fungi produce microscopic spores inside special elongated cells sacs known asci give group name
asexual reproduction
asexual reproduction dominant form propagation ascomycota responsible rapid spread fungi areas asexual reproduction ascomycetes diverse structural functional points view important general production conidia chlamydospores also frequently produced furthermore ascomycota also reproduce asexually budding
conidia formation
asexual reproduction occur vegetative reproductive spores conidia asexual nonmotile haploid spore fungus named greek word dust conia hence also known conidiospores mitospores conidiospores commonly contain nucleus products mitotic cell divisions thus sometimes call mitospores genetically identical mycelium originate typically formed ends specialized hyphae conidiophores depending species dispersed wind water animals conidiophores simply branch mycelia formed fruiting bodies







hypha creates sporing conidiating similar normal hyphal differentiated common differentiation formation bottle shaped cell called phialide spores produced asexual structures single hyphae groups conidiophores structures bear conidia aggregated form thick structure
order moniliales single hyphae exception aggregations termed coremia synnema produce structures rather like cornstokes many conidia produced mass aggregated conidiophores
diverse conidia conidiophores sometimes develop asexual sporocarps different characteristics aecervulus pycnidium sporodochium species ascomycetes form structures within plant tissue either parasite saprophytes fungi evolved complex asexual sporing structures probably influenced cultural conditions plant tissue substrate structures called sporodochium cushion conidiophores created pseudoparenchymatous stroma plant tissue pycnidium globose flaskshaped parenchymatous structure lined inner wall conidiophores acervulus flat saucer shaped conidiophores produced plant cuticle eventually erupt cuticle dispersal







budding
asexual reproduction process ascomycetes also involves budding clearly observe yeast termed “blastic process” involves blowing blebbing hyphal wall blastic process involve wall layers cell wall synthesized extruded within wall









initial events budding seen development ring chitin around point appear reinforces stabilizes cell wall enzymatic activity turgor pressure weaken extrude cell wall cell wall material incorporated phase cell contents forced progeny cell final phase mitosis ends cell plate point cell wall grow inwards forms
characteristics ascomycetes
ascomycota morphologically diverse group includes organisms unicellular yeasts complex fungi
2000 identified genera 30000 species ascomycota
unifying characteristic among diverse groups presence reproductive structure known ascus though cases reduced role life cycle
many ascomycetes commercial importance play beneficial role yeasts used baking brewing wine fermentation plus truffles morels held gourmet delicacies
many cause tree diseases dutch disease apple blights
plant pathogenic ascomycetes apple scab rice blast ergot fungi black knot powdery mildews
yeasts used produce alcoholic beverages breads mold penicillium used produce antibiotic penicillin
almost half members phylum ascomycota form symbiotic associations algae form lichens
others morels highly prized edible fungi form important mychorrhizal relationships plants thereby providing enhanced water nutrient uptake cases protection insects
almost ascomycetes terrestrial parasitic however adapted marine freshwater environments
cell walls hyphae variably composed chitin βglucans basidiomycota however fibers matrix glycoprotein containing sugars galactose mannose
mycelium ascomycetes usually made septate hyphae however necessarily fixed number nuclei divisions
septal walls septal pores provide cytoplasmic continuity throughout individual hyphae appropriate conditions nuclei also migrate septal compartments septal pores
unique character ascomycota present ascomycetes presence woronin bodies side septa separating hyphal segments control septal pores adjoining hypha ruptured woronin bodies block pores prevent loss cytoplasm ruptured compartment woronin bodies spherical hexagonal rectangular membrane bound structures crystalline protein matrix
modern classification ascomycotaedit
three subphyla described accepted

pezizomycotina largest subphylum contains ascomycetes produce ascocarps fruiting bodies except genus neolecta taphrinomycotina roughly equivalent previous taxon euascomycetes pezizomycotina includes macroscopic ascos truffles ergot ascolichens fungi discomycetes pyrenomycetes lorchels caterpillar fungus1 also contains microscopic fungi powdery mildews dermatophytic fungi laboulbeniales
saccharomycotina comprise true yeasts bakers yeast candida singlecelled unicellular fungi reproduce vegetatively budding species previously classified taxon called hemiascomycetes
taphrinomycotina include disparate basal group within ascomycota recognized following molecular analyses taxon originally named archiascomycetes archaeascomycetes includes hyphal fungi neolecta taphrina archaeorhizomyces fission yeasts schizosaccharomyces mammalian lung parasite pneumocystis

outdated taxon namesedit
several outdated taxon names—based morphological features—are still occasionally used species ascomycota include following sexual teleomorphic groups defined structures sexual fruiting bodies discomycetes included species forming apothecia pyrenomycetes included fungi formed perithecia pseudothecia structure resembling morphological structures plectomycetes included species form cleistothecia hemiascomycetes included yeasts yeastlike fungi placed saccharomycotina taphrinomycotina euascomycetes included remaining species ascomycota pezizomycotina neolecta taphrinomycotina
ascomycetes reproduce sexually known produce asci therefore anamorphic species anamorphs produce conidia mitospores previously described mitosporic ascomycota taxonomists placed group separate artificial phylum deuteromycota fungi imperfecti recent molecular analyses identified close relationships ascusbearing taxa anamorphic species grouped ascomycota despite absence defining ascus sexual asexual isolates species commonly carry different binomial species names example aspergillus nidulans emericella nidulans asexual sexual isolates respectively species
species deuteromycota classified coelomycetes produced conidia minute flask saucershaped conidiomata known technically pycnidia acervuli5 hyphomycetes species conidiophores hyphal structures carry conidiaforming cells free loosely organized mostly isolated sometimes also appear bundles cells aligned parallel described synnematal cushionshaped masses described sporodochial6
