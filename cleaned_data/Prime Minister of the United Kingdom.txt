party governmentedit
british governments ministries generally formed party prime minister cabinet usually members political party almost always majority seats house commons coalition governments ministry consists representatives parties minority governments oneparty ministry formed party command majority commons relatively rare party government system sometimes called general rule almost three hundred years
early reign william 1689–1702 preferred mixed ministries coalitions consisting tories whigs william thought composition would dilute power party also give benefit differing points view however approach work well members could agree leader policies often worked odds
1697 william formed homogeneous whig ministry known junto government often cited first true cabinet members whigs reflecting majority composition commons28
anne 1702–1714 followed pattern preferred tory cabinets approach worked well long parliament also predominantly tory however 1708 whigs obtained majority anne call form government refusing accept idea politicians could force merely party majority29 never parted entire ministry accepted entirely regardless results election anne preferred retain minority government rather dictated parliament consequently chief ministers sidney godolphin earl godolphin robert harley called prime minister difficulty executing policy face hostile parliament3031
williams annes experiments political composition cabinet illustrated strengths party government weaknesses coalition minority governments nevertheless 1830s constitutional convention established sovereign must select prime minister cabinet party whose views reflect majority parliament since ministries reflected party rule
