economic activity governed five year plans divided monthly segments government planners frequently attempting meet plan targets regardless whether market existed goods produced168 little coordination existed departments cars could produced filling stations roads built hospital warsaw 1980s could stand empty four years waiting production equipment fill it168 nevertheless political objectives propagandists could boast increased vehicle production completion another hospital168
inefficient bureaucracies frequently created instance bulgarian farms meet least hundred different plan fulfillment figures168 socialist product requirements produced distorted black market consequences broken light bulbs possessed significant market values eastern bloc offices broken light bulb required submitted light bulb would issued169
factory managers foremen could hold posts cleared nomenklatura list system partyapproved cadres169 decisions constrained party politics considered good management169 laborers work assigned pattern norms sanctions nonfulfillment169 however system really served increase inefficiency norms management would merely increase them169 stakhanovite system employed highlight achievements successful work brigades shock brigades introduced plants show others much could accomplished169

soviet union unprecedented affordability housing health care education173 apartment rent average amounted percent family budget figure reached percent municipal services factored tram tickets kopecki loaf bread kopecki average salary engineer 140160 rubles174
soviet union made major progress developing countrys consumer goods sector 1970 ussr produced million pairs leather footwear compared million united states czechoslovakia worlds highest percapita production shoes exported significant portion shoe production countries175
rising standard living socialism steady decrease workday increase leisure 1974 average workweek soviet industrial workers hours paid vacations 1968 reached minimum workdays mid1970s number free days yeardays holidays vacations 128130 almost double figure previous years176
lack market signals economies experienced misdevelopment central planners resulting countries following path extensive large mobilisation inefficiently used capital labor energy material inputs rather intensive efficient resource development attempt achieve quick growth145177 eastern bloc countries required follow soviet model overemphasising heavy industry expense light industry sectors169

factories sometimes inefficiently located incurring high transport costs poor plantorganisation sometimes resulted production hold knockon effects industries dependent monopoly suppliers intermediates179 example country including albania built steel mills regardless whether lacked requisite resource energy mineral ores169 massive metallurgical plant built bulgaria despite fact ores imported soviet union carried kilometres port burgas169 warsaw tractor factory 1980 52page list unused rusting useless equipment169
emphasis heavy industry diverted investment practical production chemicals plastics167 addition plans emphasis quantity rather quality made eastern bloc products less competitive world market167 high costs passed though product chain boosted value production wage increases based made exports less competitive179 planners rarely closed factories even capacities opened elsewhere179
example polish steel industry retained plant upper silesia despite opening modern integrated units periphery last siemensmartin process furnace installed 19th century closed immediately179
