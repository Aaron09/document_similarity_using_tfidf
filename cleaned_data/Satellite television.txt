satellite television service delivers television programming viewers relaying communications satellite orbiting earth directly viewers location1 signals received outdoor parabolic antenna commonly referred satellite dish lownoise block downconverter
satellite receiver decodes desired television programme viewing television receivers external settop boxes builtin television tuner satellite television provides wide range channels services usually television available many remote geographic areas without terrestrial television cable television service
modern systems signals relayed communications satellite band frequencies 12–18 requiring small dish less meter diameter2 first satellite systems obsolete type known television receiveonly systems received weaker analog signals transmitted cband type satellites requiring large 2–3meter dishes consequently systems nicknamed dish systems expensive less popular3
early systems used analog signals modern ones digital signals allow transmission modern television standard highdefinition television significantly improved spectral efficiency digital broadcasting
different receivers required types transmissions channels unencrypted therefore freetoair freetoview many channels transmitted encryption television requiring viewer subscribe monthly receive programming4
