hebrew grammar partly analytic expressing forms dative ablative accusative using prepositional particles rather grammatical cases however inflection plays decisive role formation verbs nouns example nouns construct state called smikhut denote relationship belonging converse genitive case inflected languages words smikhut often combined hyphens modern speech construct sometimes interchangeable preposition shel meaning many cases however older declined forms retained especially idiomatic expressions like personenclitics widely used decline prepositions
morphologyedit
like semitic languages hebrew language exhibits pattern stems consisting typically triliteral 3consonant consonantal roots 4consonant roots also exist nouns adjectives verbs formed various ways inserting vowels doubling consonants lengthening vowels andor adding prefixes suffixes infixes
hebrew uses number oneletter prefixes added words various purposes called inseparable prepositions letters hebrew אותיות השימוש‎ translit otiyot hashimush items include definite article prepositions shortened version preposition shortened version preposition conjunctions shortened version biblical conjunction asher like shortened version conjunction
vowel accompanying letters differ listed depending first letter vowel following rules governing changes hardly observed colloquial speech speakers tend employ regular form heard formal circumstances example preposition word begins moving shva preposition takes vowel initial consonant weakened colloquial bekfar village corresponds formal bikhfar
definite article inserted preposition conjunction word refers creating composite words like méhakfar village latter also demonstrates change vowel definite article assimilated prefix becomes thus behamatos becomes bamatos plane note happen form used letter therefore méhamatos valid form means airplane
