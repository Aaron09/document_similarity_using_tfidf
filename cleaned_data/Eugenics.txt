eugenic principles practiced back world history ancient greece modern history eugenics began early 20th century popular eugenics movement emerged united kingdom8 spread many countries including united states canada9 european countries period eugenic ideas espoused across political spectrum consequently many countries adopted eugenic policies intent improve quality populations genetic stock programs included positive measures encouraging individuals deemed particularly reproduce negative measures marriage prohibitions forced sterilization people deemed unfit reproduction people deemed unfit reproduce often included people mental physical disabilities people scored ranges different tests criminals deviants members disfavored minority groups eugenics movement became negatively associated nazi germany holocaust many defendants nuremberg trials attempted justify human rights abuses claiming little difference nazi eugenics programs eugenics programs10 decades following world institution human rights many countries gradually began abandon eugenics policies although western countries among united states continued carry forced sterilizations

first major challenge conventional eugenics based upon genetic inheritance made 1915 thomas hunt morgan demonstrated event genetic mutation occurring outside inheritance involving discovery hatching fruit drosophila melanogaster white eyes family redeyes117 morgan claimed demonstrated major genetic changes occurred outside inheritance concept eugenics based upon genetic inheritance completely scientifically accurate117 additionally morgan criticized view subjective traits intelligence criminality caused heredity believed definitions traits varied accurate work genetics could done traits studied accurately defined118 despite morgans public rejection eugenics much genetic research absorbed eugenics119120
heterozygote test used early detection recessive hereditary diseases allowing couples determine risk passing genetic defects future child121 goal test estimate likelihood passing hereditary disease future descendants121
recessive traits severely reduced never eliminated unless complete genetic makeup members pool known aforementioned undesirable traits huntingtons disease dominant could arguedby certain perspectives practicality eliminating traits quite lowcitation needed
examples eugenic acts managed lower prevalence recessive diseases although influencing prevalence heterozygote carriers diseases elevated prevalence certain genetically transmitted diseases among ashkenazi jewish population tay–sachs cystic fibrosis canavans disease gauchers disease decreased current populations application genetic screening122
pleiotropy occurs gene influences multiple seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits example phenylketonuria human disease affects multiple systems caused gene defect123 andrzej pękalski university wrocław argues eugenics cause harmful loss genetic diversity eugenics program selects pleiotropic gene could possibly associated positive trait pekalski uses example coercive government eugenics program prohibits people myopia breeding unintended consequence also selecting high intelligence since together124
loss genetic diversityedit
eugenic policies could also lead loss genetic diversity case culturally accepted improvement gene pool could likely—as evidenced numerous instances isolated island populations —result extinction increased vulnerability disease reduced ability adapt environmental change factors known unknown longterm specieswide eugenics plan might lead scenario similar elimination traits deemed undesirable would reduce genetic diversity definition125
edward miller claims generation realistic program make minor changes fraction gene pool giving plenty time reverse direction unintended consequences emerge reducing likelihood elimination desirable genes126 miller also argues appreciable reduction diversity future little concern needed now126
science genetics increasingly provided means certain characteristics conditions identified understood given complexity human genetics culture psychology point agreed objective means determining traits might ultimately desirable undesirable diseases sicklecell disease cystic fibrosis respectively confer immunity malaria resistance cholera single copy recessive allele contained within genotype individual reducing instance sicklecell disease genes africa malaria common deadly disease could indeed extremely negative consequences
