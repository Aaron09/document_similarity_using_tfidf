academic abstract typically outlines four elements relevant completed work

research focus statement problemsresearch issues addressed

main conclusions recommendations

also contain brief references8 although publications standard style omits references abstract reserving article body definition treats topics depth
abstract length varies discipline publisher requirements typical length ranges words rarely page occasionally words9 abstract section title abstract explicitly listed antecedent content abstracts typically sectioned logically overview appears paper following subheadings background introduction objectives methods results conclusionscitation needed abstracts subheadings explicitly given often called structured abstracts publishers articles follow imrad pattern especially original research sometimes article types structured abstract style normcitation needed abstract added imrad yielding aimrad abstracts comprise paragraph explicit subheadings often called unstructured abstracts publishers often appropriate review articles dont follow imrad pattern within bodiescitation needed
