trotsky raising hand troops polish front polish–soviet 1919


1905 trotsky formulated theory permanent revolution later became defining characteristic trotskyism 1905 revolutionaries10 claimed marxs theory history positioned revolution european capitalist society would lead socialist according position impossible socialist revolution occur backward feudal country early 20th century russia small almost powerless capitalist class
theory permanent revolution addressed question feudal regimes overthrown socialism could established given lack economic prerequisites trotsky argued russia working class could overthrow feudalism support peasantry furthermore argued russian working class would stop would revolution weak capitalist class establish workers state russia appeal working class advanced capitalist countries around world result global working class would come russias socialism could develop worldwide
capitalist bourgeoisdemocratic revolutionedit
revolutions britain 17th century france 1789 abolished feudalism established basic requisites development capitalism trotsky argued revolutions would repeated russia
results prospects written 1906 trotsky outlines theory detail arguing history repeat however much compare russian revolution great french revolution former never transformed repetition latter11 french revolution 1789 france experienced marxists called bourgeoisdemocratic revolution—a regime established wherein bourgeoisie overthrew existing french feudalistic system bourgeoisie moved towards establishing regime democratic parliamentary institutions however democratic rights extended bourgeoisie generally extended universal franchise freedom workers organize unions strike achieved without considerable struggle
trotsky argues countries like russia enlightened active revolutionary bourgeoisie could play role working class constituted small minority time european revolutions 1848 bourgeoisie already unable play comparable role want able undertake revolutionary liquidation social system stood path power
theory permanent revolutionedit
theory permanent revolution considers many countries thought trotskyism completed bourgeoisdemocratic revolution capitalist class opposes creation revolutionary situation fear stirring working class fighting revolutionary aspirations exploitation capitalism russia working class although small minority predominantly peasant based society organised vast factories owned capitalist class large working class districts russian revolution 1905 capitalist class found necessary ally reactionary elements essentially feudal landlords ultimately existing czarist russian state forces protect ownership property—factories banks etc—from expropriation revolutionary working class
therefore according theory permanent revolution capitalist classes economically backward countries weak incapable carrying revolutionary change result linked rely feudal landowners many ways thus trotsky argues majority branches industry russia originated direct influence government measures—sometimes help government subsidies—the capitalist class tied ruling elite capitalist class subservient european capital12
working class steps inedit
trotsky argued proletariat working class capable achieving tasks bourgeois revolution 1905 working class russia generation brought together vast factories relative isolation peasant life result labour vast collective effort means struggling oppression terms collective effort forming workers councils soviets course revolution year 1906 trotsky argued

factory system brings proletariat foreground proletariat immediately found concentrated tremendous masses masses autocracy stood capitalist bourgeoisie small numbers isolated people halfforeign without historical traditions inspired greed gain
leon trotsky results prospects13

instance putilov factory numbered 12000 workers 1900 according trotsky 36000 july 191714 theory permanent revolution considers peasantry whole cannot take task dispersed small holdings throughout country forms heterogeneous grouping including rich peasants employ rural workers aspire landlordism well poor peasants aspire land trotsky argues historical experience shows peasantry absolutely incapable taking independent political role15
trotskyists differ extent true today even orthodox tend recognise late twentieth century development revolts rural poor selforganising struggles landless many struggles ways reflect militant united organised struggles working class various degrees bear marks class divisions typical heroic peasant struggles previous epochs however orthodox trotskyists today still argue town city based working class struggle central task successful socialist revolution linked struggles rural poor argue working class learns necessity conduct collective struggle instance trade unions arising social conditions factories workplaces collective consciousness achieves result essential ingredient socialist reconstruction society16
although small minority russian society proletariat would lead revolution emancipate peasantry thus secure support peasantry part revolution whose support rely17 however order improve conditions working class find necessary create revolution would accomplish bourgeois revolution establish workers state
international revolutionedit
according classical marxism revolution peasantbased countries russia prepares ground ultimately development capitalism since liberated peasants become small owners producers traders leads growth commodity markets capitalist class emerges fully developed capitalist conditions prepare basis socialism
trotsky agreed socialist state economy country like russia would able hold pressures hostile capitalist world well internal pressures backward economy revolution trotsky argued must quickly spread capitalist countries bringing socialist revolution must spread worldwide revolution permanent moving necessity first bourgeois revolution workers’ revolution uninterruptedly european worldwide revolutions
position contrary classical marxism time illuminated active life shared trotsky lenin bolsheviks 1924 joseph stalin along kamenev february 1917 taken menshevik position first bourgeois revolution confronted lenin famous april theses lenins return russia death lenin seeking consolidate growing bureaucratic control bolshevik party began forward slogan socialism country
internationalist outlook permanent revolution found works karl marx term permanent revolution taken remark marx march 1850 address task marx said

make revolution permanent less propertied classes driven ruling positions proletariat conquered state power association proletarians progressed sufficiently far—not country leading countries world—that competition proletarians countries ceases least decisive forces production concentrated hands workers
