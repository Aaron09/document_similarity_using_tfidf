plane ruled surface
planes embedded 3dimensional euclidean spaceedit
section solely concerned planes embedded three dimensions specifically
determination contained points linesedit
euclidean space number dimensions plane uniquely determined following

three noncollinear points points single line
line point line
distinct intersecting lines
parallel lines

propertiesedit
following statements hold threedimensional euclidean space higher dimensions though higherdimensional analogues

distinct planes either parallel intersect line
line either parallel plane intersects single point contained plane
distinct lines perpendicular plane must parallel
distinct planes perpendicular line must parallel
