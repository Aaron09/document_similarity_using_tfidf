historical uses optionsedit
contracts similar options used since ancient times1 first reputed option buyer ancient greek mathematician philosopher thales miletus certain occasion predicted seasons olive harvest would larger usual offseason acquired right number olive presses following spring spring came olive harvest larger expected exercised options rented presses much higher price paid option23
london puts refusals calls first became wellknown trading instruments 1690s reign william mary4 privileges options sold counter nineteenth century america puts calls shares offered specialized dealers exercise price fixed roundedoff market price week option bought expiry date generally three months purchase traded secondary markets
real estate market call options long used assemble large parcels land separate owners developer pays right several adjacent plots obligated plots might unless plots entire parcel film theatrical producers often right obligation dramatize specific book script
lines credit give potential borrower right obligation borrow within specified time period
many choices embedded options traditionally included bond contracts example many bonds convertible common stock buyers option called bought back specified prices issuers option mortgage borrowers long option repay loan early corresponds callable bond option
modern stock optionsedit

payoff buying call


trader expects stocks price increase call option purchase stock fixed price strike price later date rather purchase stock outright cash outlay option premium trader would obligation stock right expiration date risk loss would limited premium paid unlike possible loss stock bought outright
holder american style call option sell option holding time expiration date would consider stocks spot price exercise price especially expects price option drop selling option early situation trader realise immediate profit alternatively exercise option example secondary market options sell stock realising profit trader would make profit spot price shares rises premium example exercise price premium paid spot price rises transaction breakeven increase stock price produces profit
stock price expiration lower exercise price holder options time call contract expire lose premium price paid transfer

payoff buying


trader expects stocks price decrease option sell stock fixed price strike price later date trader obligation sell stock right expiration date stock price expiration exercise price premium paid make profit stock price expiration exercise price contract expire lose premium paid transaction premium also plays major role enhances breakeven point example exercise price premium paid spot price profitable would make profit spot price
important note exercises option necessarily need underlying asset specifically need underlying stock order sell reason short sell underlying stock

payoffs buying butterfly spread






payoffs selling straddle






payoffs covered call


combining four basic kinds option trades possibly different exercise prices maturities basic kinds stock trades long short allows variety options strategies simple strategies usually combine trades complicated strategies combine several
strategies often used engineer particular risk profile movements underlying security example buying butterfly spread long call short calls long call allows trader profit stock price expiration date near middle exercise price expose trader large loss

iron condor strategy similar butterfly spread different strikes short options offering larger likelihood profit lower credit compared butterfly spread


selling straddle selling call exercise price would give trader greater profit butterfly final stock price near exercise price might result large loss
similar straddle strangle also constructed call whose strikes different reducing debit trade also reducing risk loss trade


wellknown strategy covered call trader buys stock holds previouslypurchased long stock position sells call stock price rises exercise price call exercised trader fixed profit stock price falls call exercised loss incurred trader partially offset premium received selling call overall payoffs match payoffs selling relationship known putcall parity offers insights financial theory benchmark index performance buywrite strategy cboe buywrite index ticker symbol


another common strategy protective trader buys stock holds previouslypurchased long stock position buys strategy acts insurance investing underlying stock hedging investors potential loses also shrinking otherwise larger profit purchasing stock without maximum profit protective theoretically unlimited strategy involves long underlying stock maximum loss limited purchase price underlying stock less strike price option premium paid protective also known married

often described vanilla options styles include

bermudan option option exercised specified dates expiration
asian option option whose payoff determined average underlying price preset time period
barrier option option general characteristic underlying securitys price must pass certain level barrier exercised
binary option allornothing option pays full amount underlying security meets defined condition expiration otherwise expires
exotic option broad category options include complex financial structures15

valuation overviewedit
options valuation topic ongoing research academic practical finance basic terms value option commonly decomposed parts

first part intrinsic value defined difference market value underlying strike price given option
second part time value depends factors multivariable nonlinear interrelationship reflect discounted expected value difference expiration

although options valuation studied least since nineteenth century contemporary approach based black–scholes model first published 19731617
valuation modelsedit
main article valuation options
value option estimated using variety quantitative techniques based concept risk neutral pricing using stochastic calculus basic model black–scholes model sophisticated models used model volatility smile models implemented using variety numerical techniques18 general standard option valuation models depend following factors

current market price underlying security
strike price option particularly relation current market price underlying money money
cost holding position underlying security including interest dividends
time expiration together restrictions exercise occur
estimate future volatility underlying securitys price life option

advanced models require additional factors estimate volatility changes time various underlying price levels dynamics stochastic interest rates
following principal valuation techniques used practice evaluate option contracts
black–scholesedit
main article black–scholes
following early work louis bachelier later work robert merton fischer black myron scholes made major breakthrough deriving differential equation must satisfied price derivative dependent nondividendpaying stock employing technique constructing risk neutral portfolio replicates returns holding option black scholes produced closedform solution european options theoretical price19 time model generates hedge parameters necessary effective risk management option holdings ideas behind black–scholes model groundbreaking eventually scholes merton receiving swedish central banks associated prize achievement economics nobel prize economics20 application model actual options trading clumsy assumptions continuous trading constant volatility constant interest rate nevertheless black–scholes model still important methods foundations existing financial market result within reasonable range21
stochastic volatility modelsedit
main article heston model
since market crash 1987 observed market implied volatility options lower strike prices typically higher higher strike prices suggesting volatility stochastic varying time price level underlying security stochastic volatility models developed including developed heston22 principal advantage heston model solved closedform stochastic volatility models require complex numerical methods22
also sabr volatility model
model implementationedit
information valuation options
valuation model chosen number different techniques used take mathematical models implement models
analytic techniquesedit
cases take mathematical model using analytical methods develop closed form solutions black–scholes black model resulting solutions readily computable greeks although rollgeskewhaley model applies american call dividend cases american options closed form solutions available approximations include baroneadesi whaley bjerksund stensland others
binomial tree pricing modeledit

monte carlo modelsedit
main article monte carlo methods option pricing
many classes options traditional valuation techniques intractable complexity instrument cases monte carlo approach often useful rather attempt solve differential equations motion describe options value relation underlying securitys price monte carlo model uses simulation generate random price paths underlying asset results payoff option average payoffs discounted yield expectation value option25 note though despite flexibility using simulation american styled options somewhat complex lattice based models
finite difference modelsedit
main article finite difference methods option pricing
equations used model option often expressed partial differential equations example black–scholes equation expressed form finite difference model derived valuation obtained number implementations finite difference methods exist option valuation including explicit finite difference implicit finite difference cranknicholson method trinomial tree option pricing model shown simplified application explicit finite difference method although finite difference approach mathematically sophisticated particularly useful changes assumed time model inputs example dividend yield risk free rate volatility combination tractable closed form
