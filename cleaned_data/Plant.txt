classification fungi controversial quite recently history biology linnaeus original classification placed fungi within plantae since unquestionably animals minerals alternatives later developments microbiology 19th century ernst haeckel felt another kingdom required classify newly discovered microorganisms introduction kingdom protista addition plantae animalia uncertainty whether fungi truly best placed plantae whether ought reclassified protists haeckel found difficult decide 1969 solution found whereby robert whittaker proposed creation kingdom fungi molecular evidence since shown recent common ancestor concestor fungi probably similar animalia plantae kingdom25
whittakers original reclassification based fundamental difference nutrition fungi plantae unlike plants generally gain carbon photosynthesis called autotrophs fungi generally obtain carbon breaking absorbing surrounding materials called heterotrophic saprotrophs addition substructure multicellular fungi different plants taking form many chitinous microscopic strands called hyphae subdivided cells form syncytium containing many eukaryotic nuclei fruiting bodies mushrooms familiar example reproductive structures fungi unlike structures produced plants
