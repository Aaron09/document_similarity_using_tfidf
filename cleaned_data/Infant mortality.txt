main article birth weight
birth weight makes 60–80 infant mortality rate developing countries england journal medicine stated lowest mortality rates occur among infants weighing 3000 3500 infants born weighing 2500 less mortality rate rapidly increases decreasing weight infants weighing 1000 less compared normalbirthweight infants weight birth almost times likely neonatal period infants weight birth relative risk neonatal death almost times greater infant mortality birth weight usually direct cause stemming medical complications preterm birth poor maternal nutritional status lack prenatal care maternal sickness pregnancy unhygienic home environments10 along birth weight period gestation makes important predictors infants chances survival overall health16

infant mortality rate correlates strongly among best predictors state failureclarification needed57 therefore also useful indicator countrys level health development component physical quality life index
however method calculating often varies widely countries based define live birth many premature infants born country reporting infant mortality rates inconsistent understated depending nations live birth criterion vital registration system reporting practices58 reported provides statistic reflects standard living nation changes infant mortality rate reflect social technical capacitiesclarification needed nations population14 world health organization defines live birth infant born demonstrating independent signs life including breathing heartbeat umbilical cord pulsation definite movement voluntary muscles59 definition used austria example60 definition also used germany slight modification muscle movement considered sign life61 many countries however including certain european states france japan count live births cases infant breathes birth makes reported numbers somewhat lower increases rates perinatal mortality62 czech republic bulgaria instance requirements live birth even higher63
although many countries vital registration systems certain reporting practices many inaccuracies particularly undeveloped nations statistics number infants dying studies shown comparing three information sources official registries household surveys popular reporters popular death reporters accurate popular death reporters include midwives gravediggers coffin builders priests others—essentially people knew childs death developing nations access vital registries governmentrun systems record births deaths difficult poor families several reasons struggles force stress familiesclarification needed make take drastic measuresclarification needed unofficial death ceremonies deceased infants result government statistics inaccurately reflect nations infant mortality rate popular death reporters firsthand information provided information collected collated provide reliable data provide nation accurate death counts meaningful causes deaths measuredstudied46
unicef uses statistical methodology account reporting differences among countries

unicef compiles infant mortality country estimates derived sources methods estimation obtained either standard reports direct estimation micro data sets unicefs yearly exercise order sort differences estimates produced different sources different methods unicef developed coordination unsd estimation methodology minimizes errors embodied estimate harmonize trends along time since estimates necessarily exact values used input model often recognized official estimates used country level however mentioned estimates minimize errors maximize consistency trends along time64

another challenge comparability practice counting frail premature infants normal date miscarriages spontaneous abortions immediately childbirth stillborn therefore quality countrys documentation perinatal mortality matter greatly accuracy infant mortality statistics point reinforced demographer ansley coale finds dubiously high ratios reported stillbirths infant deaths hong kong japan first hours birth pattern consistent high recorded ratios birth countries suggests many female infants first hours misreported stillbirths rather infant deaths also countries follow recommendations reporting live births infant deaths65
another seemingly paradoxical finding countries poor medical services introduce medical centers services instead declining reported imrs often increase time mainly improvement access medical care often accompanied improvement registration births deaths deaths might occurred remote rural area reported government might reported medical personnel facilities thus even health services reduce actual reported increase
collecting accurate statistics infant mortality rate could issue rural communities developing countries communities alternative methods calculating infant mortality rate emerged example popular death reporting household survey46 countrytocountry variation child mortality rates huge growing wider despite progress among worlds roughly nations somalia showed decrease under5 mortality rate past decadesthe lowest rate 2011 singapore deaths children 1000 live births highest sierra leone child deaths 1000 births global rate deaths 1000 births united states rate eight 1000 births66
