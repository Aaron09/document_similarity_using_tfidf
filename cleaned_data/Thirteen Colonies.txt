provincial colony governed commissions created pleasure king governor provinces council appointed crown governor invested general executive powers authorized call locally elected assembly governors council would upper house assembly session addition role advising governor assemblies made representatives elected freeholders planters landowners province governor power absolute veto could prorogue delay dissolve assembly assemblys role make local laws ordinances ensuring inconsistent laws england practice always occur since many provincial assemblies sought expand powers limit governor crown laws could examined british privy council board trade also held veto power legislation hampshire york virginia north carolina south carolina georgia eventually massachusetts crown colonies

british role
1680 royal government london took increasing interest affairs colonies growing rapidly population wealth 1680 virginia royal colony 1720 half control royal governors governors appointees closely tied government london
historians 1880s emphasized american nationalism however scholarship time heavily influenced imperial school herbert osgood george louis beer charles mclean andrews lawrence gipson viewpoint dominated colonial historiography 1940s emphasized often praised attention london gave colonies view never threat 1770s colony would revolt seek independence43
selfgovernment
british settlers come american colonies intention creating democratic system quickly created broad electorate without landowning aristocracy along pattern free elections strong emphasis voter participation colonies offered much freer degree suffrage england indeed country property owner could vote members lower house legislature could even vote governor connecticut rhode island44 voters required hold interest society south carolina legislature said 1716 necessary reasonable none persons interest province capable elect members commons house assembly45 main legal criterion interest ownership real estate property uncommon britain controlled politically landlords women children indentured servants slaves subsumed interest family head london insisted requirement colonies telling governors exclude ballot freeholders—that land nevertheless land widely owned eligible vote46

economic policy
british empire time operated mercantile system trade concentrated inside empire trade empires forbidden goal enrich britain—its merchants government whether policy good colonists issue london americans became increasingly restive mercantilist policies49
mercantilism meant government merchants became partners goal increasing political power private wealth exclusion empires government protected merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers regulations subsidies domestic industries order maximize exports minimize imports realm government fight smuggling—which became favorite american technique 18th century circumvent restrictions trading french spanish dutch50 tactic used mercantilism trade surpluses gold silver would pour london government took share duties taxes remainder going merchants britain government spent much revenue superb royal navy protected british colonies threatened colonies empires sometimes seized thus british navy captured amsterdam york 1664 colonies captive markets british industry goal enrich mother country51
britain implemented mercantilism trying block american trade french spanish dutch empires using navigation acts americans avoided often could royal officials responded smuggling openended search warrants writs assistance 1761 boston lawyer james otis argued writs violated constitutional rights colonists lost case john adams later wrote child independence born52
