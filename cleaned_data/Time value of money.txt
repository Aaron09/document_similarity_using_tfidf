present value 1000 years future curves represent constant discount rates


time value money describes greater benefit receiving money rather later founded time preference
principle time value money explains interest paid earned interest whether bank deposit debt compensates depositor lender time value money
also underlies investment investors willing forgo spending money expect favorable return investment future
historically christian societies many islamic societies today charging interest would considered usury

time value money problems involve value cash flows different points time

several basic equations represent equalities listed solutions found using cases formulas financial calculator spreadsheet formulas programmed financial calculators several spreadsheet functions rate nper pmt7
equations formula also rearranged determine unknowns case standard annuity formula however closedform algebraic solution interest rate although financial calculators spreadsheet programs readily determine solutions rapid trial error algorithms
equations frequently combined particular uses example bonds readily priced using equations typical coupon bond composed types payments stream coupon payments similar annuity lumpsum return capital bonds maturity—that future payment formulas combined determine present value bond
important note interest rate interest rate relevant period annuity makes payment year annual interest rate income payment stream different payment schedule interest rate must converted relevant periodic interest rate example monthly rate mortgage monthly payments requires interest rate divided example compound interest details converting different periodic interest rates
rate return calculations either variable solved predefined variable measures discount rate interest inflation rate return cost equity cost debt number analogous concepts choice appropriate rate critical exercise incorrect discount rate make results meaningless
calculations involving annuities must decide whether payments made period known ordinary annuity beginning period known annuity using financial calculator spreadsheet usually either calculation following formulas ordinary annuity want answer present value annuity simply multiply ordinary annuity
