since user generates controlling signal strength important issue cdma transmitters synchronous cdma tdma fdma receiver theory completely reject arbitrarily strong signals using different codes time slots frequency channels orthogonality systems true asynchronous cdma rejection unwanted signals partial unwanted signals much stronger desired signal overwhelm leads general requirement asynchronous cdma system approximately match various signal power levels seen receiver cdma cellular base station uses fast closedloop powercontrol scheme tightly control mobiles transmit power
advantages asynchronous cdma techniquesedit
efficient practical utilization fixed frequency spectrumedit
theory cdma tdma fdma exactly spectral efficiency practice challenges power control case cdma timing case tdma frequency generationfiltering case fdma
tdma systems must carefully synchronize transmission times users ensure received correct time slot cause interference since cannot perfectly controlled mobile environment time slot must guard time reduces probability users interfere decreases spectral efficiency
similarly fdma systems must guard band adjacent channels unpredictable doppler shift signal spectrum user mobility guard bands reduce probability adjacent channels interfere decrease utilization spectrum
flexible allocation resourcesedit
asynchronous cdma offers advantage flexible allocation resources allocation codes active users case synchronous cdma tdma fdma number simultaneous orthogonal codes time slots frequency slots respectively fixed hence capacity terms number simultaneous users limited fixed number orthogonal codes time slots frequency bands allocated tdma fdma systems remain underutilized bursty nature telephony packetized data transmissions strict limit number users supported asynchronous cdma system practical limit governed desired error probability since signaltointerference ratio varies inversely number users bursty traffic environment like mobile telephony advantage afforded asynchronous cdma performance error rate allowed fluctuate randomly average value determined number users times percentage utilization suppose users talk half time users accommodated average error probability users talk time difference error probability users talking time constant whereas random quantity mean users talking half time

spreadspectrum characteristics cdmaedit
modulation schemes minimize bandwidth signal since bandwidth limited resource however spreadspectrum techniques transmission bandwidth several orders magnitude greater minimal required signal bandwidth initial reasons military applications including guidance communication systems systems designed using spread spectrum security resistance jamming asynchronous cdma level privacy built signal spread using pseudorandom code code makes spreadspectrum signals appear random noiselike properties receiver cannot demodulate transmission without knowledge pseudorandom sequence used encode data cdma also resistant jamming jamming signal finite amount power available signal jammer either spread energy entire bandwidth signal part entire signal11
cdma also effectively reject narrowband interference since narrowband interference affects small portion spreadspectrum signal easily removed notch filtering without much loss information convolution encoding interleaving used assist recovering lost data cdma signals also resistant multipath fading since spreadspectrum signal occupies large bandwidth small portion undergo fading multipath given time like narrowband interference result small loss data overcome
another reason cdma resistant multipath interference delayed versions transmitted pseudorandom codes poor correlation original pseudorandom code thus appear another user ignored receiver words long multipath channel induces least chip delay multipath signals arrive receiver shifted time least chip intended signal correlation properties pseudorandom codes slight delay causes multipath appear uncorrelated intended signal thus ignored
cdma devices rake receiver exploits multipath delay components improve performance system rake receiver combines information several correlators tuned different path delay producing stronger version signal simple receiver single correlation tuned path delay strongest signal12
frequency reuse ability reuse radio channel frequency cell sites within cellular system fdma tdma systems frequency planning important consideration frequencies used different cells must planned carefully ensure signals different cells interfere cdma system frequency used every cell channelization done using pseudorandom codes reusing frequency every cell eliminates need frequency planning cdma system however planning different pseudorandom sequences must done ensure received signal cell correlate signal nearby cell13
since adjacent cells frequencies cdma systems ability perform soft handoffs soft handoffs allow mobile telephone communicate simultaneously cells best signal quality selected handoff complete different hard handoffs utilized cellular systems hardhandoff situation mobile telephone approaches handoff signal strength vary abruptly contrast cdma systems soft handoff undetectable provides reliable higherquality signal13
