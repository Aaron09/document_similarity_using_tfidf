earliest radio stations simply radiotelegraphy systems carry audio audio broadcasts possible electronic detection amplification devices incorporated
thermionic valve invented 1904 english physicist john ambrose fleming developed device called oscillation valve passes current direction heated filament cathode capable thermionic emission electrons would flow plate anode higher voltage electrons however could pass reverse direction plate heated thus capable thermionic emission electrons later known fleming valve could used rectifier alternating current radio wave detector1 greatly improved crystal rectified radio signal using early solidstate diode based crystal socalled cats whisker however still required amplifier
