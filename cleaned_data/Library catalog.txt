title catalog distinguish sort orders

grammatical sort order used mainly older catalogs important word title first sort term importance word measured grammatical rules example first noun defined important word
mechanical sort order first word title first sort term catalogs scheme still include trace grammatical sort order neglect article beginning title

grammatical sort order advantage often important word title also good keyword question word users remember first memory incomplete however disadvantage many elaborate grammatical rules needed expert users able search catalog without help librarian
catalogs persons names standardized name person always cataloged sorted standard form even appears differently library material standardization achieved process called authority control simply authority control defined establishment maintenance consistent forms terms names subjects titles used headings bibliographic records24 advantage authority control easier answer question works author library hand difficult answer question library specific material material spells author peculiar variant cataloguer incur much work check whether smith smith john smith jack
works even title standardized technical term uniform title example translations reeditions sometimes sorted original title many catalogs parts bible sorted standard name books contain plays william shakespeare another frequently cited example role played uniform title library catalog
many complications alphabetic sorting entries arise examples

languages know sorting conventions differ language catalog example dutch catalogs sort english catalog follow suit dutch catalog sort nondutch words also pseudoligatures sometimes come beginning word œdipus also collation locale
titles contain numbers example 2001 space odyssey sorted numbers spelled thousand booktitles begin nonnumeralnonalphabetic glyphs similarly difficult books diacritics first letter similar farmorecommon problem casefolding title standard stripping diacritics change meaning words
balzac honoré balzac honoré ortega gasset josé gasset josé ortega first example balzac legal cultural last name splitting apart would equivalent listing book tennis enroe john instance second example culturally legally lastname ortega gasset sometimes shortened simply ortega masculine lastname splitting culturally incorrect standards culture author defies normal understanding last name is—ie final word ordered list names define person—in cultures multiwordlastnames rare also authors authors culture surname traditionally printed first thus last name terms order fact persons firstname culturally

fuller discussion collation
subject catalog decide classification system cataloguer select appropriate subject headings bibliographic item unique classification number sometimes known call number used identification also purposes shelving placing items similar subjects near another aids browsing library users thus often able take advantage serendipity search process
