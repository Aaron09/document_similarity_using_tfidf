graphical representationsedit
although normal regard quantity demanded quantity supplied functions price goods standard graphical representation usually attributed alfred marshall price vertical axis quantity horizontal axis
since determinants supply demand price goods question explicitly represented supplydemand diagram changes values variables represented moving supply demand curves often described shifts curves contrast responses changes price good represented movements along unchanged supply demand curves
supply scheduleedit
supply schedule table shows relationship price good quantity supplied assumption perfect competition supply determined marginal cost firms produce additional output cost producing extra unit output less price would receive
hike cost goods would decrease supply shifting costs discount would increase supply shifting costs hurting producers producer surplus decreases
nature conceptualizing supply curve requires firm perfect competitor influence market price true point supply curve answer question firm faced potential price much output able willing sell firm market power decision much output provide market influences market price therefore firm faced price question becomes less relevant
economists distinguish supply curve individual firm market supply curve market supply curve obtained summing quantities supplied suppliers potential price thus graph supply curve individual firms supply curves added horizontally obtain market supply curve
economists also distinguish shortrun market supply curve longrun market supply curve context things assumed constant definition short availability fixed inputs typically physical capital number firms industry long firms chance adjust holdings physical capital enabling better adjust quantity supplied given price furthermore long potential competitors enter exit industry response market conditions reasons longrun market supply curves generally flatter shortrun counterparts
determinants supply

demand scheduleedit
demand schedule depicted graphically demand curve represents amount goods buyers willing able purchase various prices assuming determinants demand price good question income tastes preferences price substitute goods price complementary goods remain following demand demand curve almost always represented downwardsloping meaning price decreases consumers good1
like supply curves reflect marginal cost curves demand curves determined marginal utility curves2 consumers willing given quantity good given price marginal utility additional consumption equal opportunity cost determined price marginal utility alternative consumption choices demand schedule defined willingness ability consumer purchase given product given frame time
aforementioned demand curve generally downwardsloping rare examples goods upwardsloping demand curves different hypothetical types goods upwardsloping demand curves giffen goods inferior staple good veblen goods goods made fashionable higher price
nature conceptualizing demand curve requires purchaser perfect competitor—that purchaser influence market price true point demand curve answer question buyer faced potential price much product purchase buyer market power decision much influences market price buyer faced price question meaningless
like supply curves economists distinguish demand curve individual market demand curve market demand curve obtained summing quantities demanded consumers potential price thus graph demand curve individuals demand curves added horizontally obtain market demand curve

equilibriumedit
generally speaking equilibrium defined pricequantity pair quantity demanded equal quantity supplied represented intersection demand supply curves3 analysis various equilibria fundamental aspect microeconomics
market equilibrium situation market price quantity demanded consumers correctly balanced quantity firms wish supply situation market clears4
changes market equilibrium practical uses supply demand analysis often center different variables change equilibrium price quantity represented shifts respective curves comparative statics shift traces effects initial equilibrium equilibrium
demand curve shifts
main article demand curve
consumers increase quantity demanded given price referred increase demand increased demand represented graph curve shifted right price point greater quantity demanded initial curve curve diagram raises equilibrium price higher raises equilibrium quantity higher movement along curve described change quantity demanded distinguish change demand shift curve increase demand caused increase equilibrium quantity increase demand could also come changing tastes fashions incomes price changes complementary substitute goods market expectations number buyers would cause entire demand curve shift changing equilibrium price quantity note diagram shift demand curve causing equilibrium price emerge resulted movement along supply curve point point
demand decreases opposite happens shift curve left demand starts decreases equilibrium price decrease equilibrium quantity also decrease quantity supplied price demand shift reflecting fact supply curve shifted equilibrium quantity price different result change shift demand
supply curve shifts
main article supply economics
technological progress occurs supply curve shifts example assume someone invents better growing wheat cost growing given quantity wheat decreases otherwise stated producers willing supply wheat every price shifts supply curve outward s2—an increase supply increase supply causes equilibrium price decrease equilibrium quantity increases consumers move along demand curve lower price result supply curve shift price quantity move opposite directions quantity supplied decreases opposite happens supply curve starts shifts leftward equilibrium price increase equilibrium quantity decrease consumers move along demand curve higher price associated lower quantity demanded quantity demanded price supply shift reflecting fact demand curve shifted change shift supply equilibrium quantity price changed
movement supply curve response change nonprice determinant supply caused change yintercept constant term supply equation supply curve shifts axis nonprice determinants demand change
partial equilibriumedit
main article partial equilibrium
partial equilibrium name suggests takes consideration part market attain equilibrium
jain proposes attributed george stigler partial equilibrium based restricted range data standard example price single product prices products held fixed analysis5
supplyanddemand model partial equilibrium model economic equilibrium clearance market specific goods obtained independently prices quantities markets words prices substitutes complements well income levels consumers constant makes analysis much simpler general equilibrium model includes entire economy
dynamic process prices adjust supply equals demand powerfully simple technique allows study equilibrium efficiency comparative statics stringency simplifying assumptions inherent approach make model considerably tractable produce results seemingly precise effectively model real world economic phenomena
partial equilibrium analysis examines effects policy action creating equilibrium particular sector market directly affected ignoring effect market industry assuming small little impact
hence analysis considered useful constricted markets
léon walras first formalized idea oneperiod economic equilibrium general economic system french economist antoine augustin cournot english political economist alfred marshall developed tractable models analyze economic system
marketsedit
model supply demand also applies various specialty markets
model commonly applied wages market labor typical roles supplier demander reversed suppliers individuals sell labor highest price demanders labor businesses type labor need lowest price equilibrium price certain type labor wage rate6 however economist steve fleetwood revisited empirical reality supply demand curves labor markets concluded evidence best inconclusive worst casts doubt existence instance cites kaufman hotchkiss 2006 adult nearly studies find labour supply curve negatively sloped backward bending
classical keynesian economics money market analyzed supplyanddemand system interest rates price money supply vertical supply curve central bank country chooses monetary policy value regardless interest rate case money supply totally inelastic hand8 money supply curve horizontal line central bank targeting fixed interest rate ignoring value money supply case money supply curve perfectly elastic demand money intersects money supply determine interest rate9
