etymology definitionedit
term ontology origin philosophy applied many different ways word element onto comes greek ὄντος present participle verb εἰμί core meaning within computer science model describing world consists types properties relationship types also generally expectation features model ontology closely resemble real world related object4
overviewedit
ontologies common computer science philosophy representation entities ideas events along properties relations according system categories fields considerable work problems ontological relativity quine kripke philosophy sowa guarino computer science5 debates whether normative ontology viable debates foundationalism philosophy project differences largely matters focus computer scientists concerned establishing fixed controlled vocabularies philosophers concerned first principles whether things fixed essences whether enduring objects must ontologically primary processes
fields make ontological assumptions sometimes explicitly elaborated explored instance definition ontology economics also sometimes called political economy hotly debated especially marxist economics6 primary concern also subfields7 concerns intersect information science simulation model intended enable economic decisions example determine capital assets risk much risk management claim social sciences explicit ontology issues hard falsifiability criteria like models physical sciences indeed lack widely accepted hard falsification criteria defines social soft sciencecitation needed
historyedit
historically ontologies arise branch philosophy known metaphysics deals nature reality exists fundamental branch concerned analyzing various types modes existence often special attention relations particulars universals intrinsic extrinsic properties essence existence traditional goal ontological inquiry particular divide world joints discover fundamental categories kinds world’s objects naturally fall8
second half 20th century philosophers extensively debated possible methods approaches building ontologies without actually building elaborate ontologies themselvescitation needed contrast computer scientists building large robust ontologies wordnet comparatively little debate builtcitation needed
since mid1970s researchers field artificial intelligence recognized capturing knowledge building large powerful systems researchers argued could create ontologies computational models enable certain kinds automated reasoning 1980s community began term ontology refer theory modeled world component knowledge systems researchers drawing inspiration philosophical ontologies viewed computational ontology kind applied philosophy9
early 1990s widely cited page paper toward principles design ontologies used knowledge sharing gruber10 credited deliberate definition ontology technical term computer science gruber introduced term mean specification conceptualization

ontology description like formal specification program concepts relationships formally exist agent community agents definition consistent usage ontology concept definitions general different sense word philosophy11

according gruber 1993

ontologies often equated taxonomic hierarchies classes class definitions subsumption relation ontologies need limited forms ontologies also limited conservative definitions definitions traditional logic sense introduce terminology knowledge world12 specify conceptualization needs state axioms constrain possible interpretations defined terms1

refinement grubers definition feilmayr 2016 stated ontology formal explicit specification shared conceptualization characterized high semantic expressiveness required increased complexity13

ontologies commonly encoded using ontology languages
typesedit
domain ontologyedit
domain ontology domainspecific ontology represents concepts belong part world particular meanings terms applied domain provided domain ontology example word card many different meanings ontology domain poker would model playing card meaning word ontology domain computer hardware would model punched card video card meanings
since domain ontologies represent concepts specific often eclectic ways often incompatible systems rely domain ontologies expand often need merge domain ontologies general representation presents challenge ontology designer different ontologies domain arise different languages different intended usage ontologies different perceptions domain based cultural background education ideology
present merging ontologies developed common foundation ontology largely manual process therefore timeconsuming expensive domain ontologies foundation ontology provide basic elements specify meanings domain ontology elements merged automatically studies generalized techniques merging ontologies14 area research still largely theoretical
upper ontologyedit
