introductionedit




differences humans animals structured different terms used according neuraxis whether animal vertebrate invertebrate



standardized anatomical zoological terms location developed usually based latin greek words enable biological medical scientists precisely delineate communicate information animal bodies component organs even though meaning terms often contextsensitive3
vertebrates craniata share substantial heritage common structure many terms used describe location avoid ambiguities terminology based anatomy animal standard
humans type vertebrate anatomical terms differ forms vertebrates reason humans different neuraxis unlike animals rest four limbs humans considered describing anatomy standard anatomical position thus human head whereas back flounder could refer either left right side
invertebrates standard application locational terminology often becomes difficult debatable best differences morphology radical common concepts homologous refer common concepts example many species even bilaterally symmetrical species terminology depends type symmetry
standard anatomical positionedit

main article standard anatomical position
animals change orientation respect environment appendages like limbs tentacles change position respect main body positional descriptive terms need refer animal standard anatomical position descriptions respect organism standard anatomical position even organism question appendages another position helps avoid confusion terminology referring organism different postures
humans refers body standing position arms side palms facing forward thumbs universal vertebrate terminology used veterinary medicine would work human medicine human terms thought well established worth changing
combined termsedit




dorsolateral flattening anatomy krait gives body triangular crosssection



many anatomical terms combined either indicate position axes simultaneously indicate direction movement relative body example anterolateral indicates position anterior lateral body axis bulk pectoralis major muscle radiology xray image said anteroposterior indicating beam xrays pass source patients anterior body wall body exit posterior body wall4
definite limit contexts terms modified qualify combinations generally modifier term truncated added prefixing qualified term example view animal aspect dorsal lateral might called dorsolateral view effect dorsolateral flattening organism krait gives body triangular cross section describing morphology organ habitus animal many platyhelminthes might speak dorsiventrally flattened opposed bilaterally flattened animals ocean sunfish
desirable three terms agglutinated concatenated anteriodorsolateral terms sometimes used hyphenated modern tendency omit hyphen however little basis strict rule interfere choice convenience usage5

anatomical directional reference


terms proximal latin proximus meaning nearest distal latin distare meaning stand away used describe parts feature close distant main mass body respectively10 thus upper humans proximal hand distal
terms particularly useful describing appendages fins tentacles limbs indeed structure extends potentially move separately main body although direction indicated proximal distal always respectively towards away point attachment given structure either proximal distal relation another point reference thus elbow distal wound upper proximal wound lower arm11
terminology also employed molecular biology therefore extension also used chemistry specifically referring atomic loci molecules overall moiety given compound12
central peripheraledit
central peripheral terms closely related concepts proximal distal widely applicable many respects flexibility makes hard define loosely speaking distinguish near inside even organs vital importance heart lungs peripheral organs fingers undoubtedly important lifethreatening dispense examples application terms distinction central peripheral nervous systems peripheral blood vessels central circulatory organs heart major vessels terms also apply large complex molecules proteins central amino acid residues protected antibodies like peripheral residues important docking interactions examples include central peripheral circadian clocks13 central versus peripheral vision14
superficial deepedit
terms relate distance structure surface animal
deep english refers something away surface organism example external oblique muscle abdomen deep skin deep anatomical terms location derived english rather latin anglicised latin term would profound latin profundus meaning depth
superficial latin superficies meaning surface refers something near outer surface organism example skin epidermis superficial subcutis
dorsal ventraledit
terms used anatomy embryology refer back dorsal front belly ventral organism
dorsal latin dorsum meaning back surface organism refers back upper side organism talking skull dorsal side top15
ventral latin venter meaning belly surface refers front lower side organism15
example fish pectoral fins dorsal anal ventral dorsal
cranial caudaledit





human skull terms rostral caudal adapted curved neuraxis hominidae



specific terms exist describe close something head tail animal describe close head animal something three distinct terms used

rostral latin rostrum meaning beak nose meaning situated toward oral nasal region case brain toward frontal lobe
cranial greek κρανίον meaning skull cephalic greek κεφαλή meaning head2
caudal latin cauda meaning tail used describe close something organism

example horse eyes caudal nose rostral back head
terms generally preferred veterinary medicine used often human medicine21617 humans cranial cephalic used refer skull cranial used commonly term rostral rarely used human anatomy apart embryology refers front face superior aspect organism similarly term caudal occasionally used human anatomy9 brain situated superior part head whereas nose situated anterior part thus rostrocaudal axis refers shape image
terms special casesedit
anatomical landmarksedit
location anatomical structures also described relation different anatomical landmarks
structures described level specific spinal vertebra depending section vertebral column structure position often abbreviated example structures level fourth cervical vertebra abbreviated level thoracic vertebra level lumbar vertebra sacrum coccyx fused often used provide location
references also take origin superficial anatomy made landmarks skin visible underneath example structures described relative anterior superior iliac spine medial malleolus medial epicondyle
anatomical lines theoretical lines drawn structures also used describe anatomical location example midclavicular line used part cardiac exam medicine feel apex beat heart
mouth teethedit
main article dental terminology
fields osteology palaeontology dentistry apply special terms location describe mouth teeth although teeth aligned main axes within different relationships require special terminology well example teeth also rotated contexts terms like anterior lateral become ambiguous1819 terms distal proximal also redefined mean distance away close mandibular symphysis terms used describe structures include buccal latin bucca meaning cheek palatal latin referring structures close cheek hard palate respectively
hands feetedit




anatomical terms used describe human hand


several anatomical terms particular hands feet
improved clarity directional term palmar latin palma meaning palm hand usually used describe front hand dorsal back hand example dogs dorsal surface underside either palmar forelimb plantar hindlimb surface palmar fascia palmar tendons muscles flex fingers dorsal venous arch named dorsal side foot
volar also used refer underside palm sole also sometimes used describe location palmar plantar example volar pads underside hands fingers feet toes
terms used avoid confusion describing median surface hand anterior posterior surface anterior used describe palm hand posterior used describe back hand confusion arise forearm pronate supinate
similarly forearm clarity sides named bones structures closer radius radial structures closer ulna ulnar structures relating bones referred radioulnar similarly lower structures near tibia shinbone tibial structures near fibula fibular peroneal
rotational directionedit
terms anatomical location relative linear motion translation along zaxes degrees freedom well particular rotation around three axes
anteversion retroversion complementary anatomical terms location describing degree anatomical structure rotated forwards towards front body backwards towards back body respectively relative datum position terms also describe positioning surgical implants arthroplasty

anteversion refers anatomical structure tilted forward normal whether pathologically incidentally example need measure anteversion neck bone femur20 example womans uterus typically anteverted tilted slightly forward misaligned pelvis anteverted tilted forward relevant degree
retroversion rotation around axis anteversion opposite sense tilting back structure affected described retroverted anteversion retroversion completely general term apply backward tilting hard structures bones soft organs uteri surgical implants

directional termsedit
several terms also used describe location terms used form fixed axes terms include

axial latin axis meaning axle around central axis organism extremity related terms abaxial adaxial refer locations away toward central axis organism respectively
parietal latin paries meaning wall pertaining wall body cavity example parietal peritoneum lining inside abdominal cavity parietal also refer specifically parietal bone skull associated structures
posteromedial latin posterus meaning coming medius meaning middle situated towards middle posterior surface
terminal latin terminus meaning boundary extremity usually projecting structure antenna terminal sensory hair
visceral viscus latin viscera meaning internal organs associated organs within bodys cavities example stomach covered lining called visceral peritoneum opposed parietal pertoneum viscus also used mean organ example stomach viscus within abdominal cavity

prefixes suffixes modifiersedit
directional locational prefixes modify many anatomical morphological terms sometimes formally standard usage often attached arbitrarily according need convenience
prefixes

latin meaning preposition beneath close nearly appended prefix without hyphen qualifies terms various senses consider subcutaneous meaning beneath skin subterminal meaning near structure also mean nearly moreorless instance subglobular means almost globular many usages similar application hypo
hypo ancient greek meaning like various senses hypolingual nerve beneath tongue hypodermal beneath skin
infra latin infra meaning preposition beneath similar direct opposite super supra infratemporal space infraorbital
inter latin inter meaning structures example navel intermediate left contralateral right intercostal muscles ribs
super supra latin super supra meaning beyond appended prefix without hyphen superciliary arches supraorbital

suffixes

latin meaning towards

commonly example anatomical feature nearer something another expression nearer distal distal however unambiguous concise convention latin suffix meaning towards sometimes example distad means distal direction distad femur means beyond femur distal direction suffix used widely following examples anteriad towards anterior apicad towards apex basad towards basal caudad centrad cephalad towards cephalic craniad dextrad dextrocaudad dextrocephalad distad dorsad ectad towards ectal exterior direction entad towards interior laterad mediad mesad neurad orad posteriad proximad rostrad sinistrad sinistrocaudad sinistrocephalad ventrad21
specific animals organismsedit
large variety body shapes present invertebrates presents difficult problem attempting apply standard directional terms depending organism terms taken analogy vertebrate anatomy appropriate novel terms applied needed borrowed terms widely applicable invertebrates example proximal literally meaning near refers part appendage nearest joins body distal literally meaning standing away used part furthest point attachment cases usage terms dependent body plan organism
example especially organisms without distinct heads reasons broader applicability anterior usually preferred21617
humansedit
humans approximately bilaterally symmetrical organisms1 anatomical descriptions usually terms vertebrates members taxonomic group bilateria however historical reasons standard human directional terminology several differences used bilaterally symmetrical organisms
terms zootomy anatomy came time scientific communication took place latin original latin forms respective meanings anterior posterior front behind dorsal ventral toward spine toward belly superior inferior
humans however rare property upright torso makes anteriorposterior dorsalventral directions inferiorsuperior directions necessary22
animals furthermore capable moving relative environment might refer direction standing humans head term might used refer direction belly supine human also necessary employ specific anatomical knowledge order apply terminology unambiguously example ears would superior shoulders human fails describing armadillo shoulders ears thus veterinary terminology ears would cranial toward head shoulders armadillo kangaroo terrestrial vertebrate including human likewise belly considered anterior front back humans terminology fails flounder armadillo veterinary terms belly would ventral toward abdomen vertebrates
would possible introduce system axes completely consistent humans vertebrates separate pairs axes used exclusively head anteriorposterior inferiorsuperior exclusively torso dorsalventral caudalrostral toward tailtoward beak would require renaming many anatomical structures
asymmetrical spherical organismsedit




figure asymmetrical spherical body shapes organism asymmetrical amoeboid body plan amoeba proteus amoeba organism spherical body plan actinophrys heliozoan


organisms changeable shape amoeboid organisms directional terms meaningless since shape organism constant distinct axes fixed similarly spherically symmetrical organisms nothing distinguish line centre organism indefinite number triads mutually perpendicular axes could defined choice axes would useless nothing would distinguish chosen triad others organisms terms superficial deep sometimes proximal distal usefully descriptive




figure four individuals phaeodactylum tricornutum diatom fixed elongated shape


elongated organismsedit
organisms maintain constant shape dimension longer least directional terms used long longitudinal axis defined points opposite ends organism similarly perpendicular transverse axis defined points opposite sides organism typically basis definition third axis usually organisms planktonic freeswimming protists nearly always viewed microscope slides appear essentially twodimensional cases third axis defined particularly nonterminal cytostome unique structure present17




figure organisms ends long axis distinct paramecium caudatum stentor roeseli


elongated protists distinctive ends body organisms mouth equivalent structure cytostome paramecium stentor usually points direction organisms locomotion flagellum euglena normally designated anterior opposite becomes posterior end17 properly terminology would apply organism always planktonic normally attached surface although term also applied sessile normally attached surface23




figure cluster euplectella aspergillum sponges venus flower baskets showing apicalbasal axes


organisms attached substrate sponges animallike protists also distinctive ends part organism attached substrate usually referred basal latin basis supportfoundation whereas furthest attachment referred apical latin apex peaktip
radially symmetrical organismsedit
radially symmetrical organisms include group radiata primarily jellyfish anemones corals comb jellies217 adult echinoderms starfish urchins cucumbers others also included since pentaradial meaning five discrete rotational symmetry echinoderm larvae included since bilaterally symmetrical217 radially symmetrical organisms always distinctive axis
cnidarians jellyfish anemones corals incomplete digestive system meaning organism mouth opposite opening coelenteron17 reason organism mouth referred oral latin mouth opposite surface aboral latin prefix meaning away
unlike vertebrates cnidarians distinctive axes lateral dorsal ventral meaning organisms replaced generic term peripheral greek περί around medial used case radiates indicates central point rather central axis vertebrates thus multiple possible radial axes medioperipheral half axes however noteworthy biradially symmetrical comb jellies distinct tentacular pharyngeal axes24 thus anatomically equivalent bilaterally symmetrical animals
vertebrates appendages move independently body tentacles cnidarians comb jellies definite proximodistal axis
