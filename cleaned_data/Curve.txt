parabola simple example curve


mathematics curve also called curved line older texts generally speaking object similar line need straight thus curve generalization line curvature need zeroa
various disciplines within mathematics given term different meanings depending area study precise meaning depends context however many meanings special instances definition follows curve topological space locally homeomorphic line everyday language means curve points near points looks like line deformation simple example curve parabola shown right large number curves studied multiple mathematical fields
closed curve curve forms path whose starting point also ending point—that path points point
closely related meanings include graph function phillips curve twodimensional graph

megalithic newgrange showing early interest curves


interest curves began long subject mathematical study seen numerous examples decorative everyday objects dating back prehistoric times1 curves least graphical representations simple create example stick sand beach
historically term line used place modern term curve hence phrases straight line right line used distinguish today called lines curved lines example book euclids elements line defined breadthless length straight line defined line lies evenly points euclids idea line perhaps clarified statement extremities line points later commentators classified lines according various schemes example3

composite lines lines forming angle
incomposite lines

determinate lines extend indefinitely circle
indeterminate lines extend indefinitely straight line parabola







curves created slicing cone conic sections among curves studied ancient greece


greek geometers studied many kinds curves reason interest solving geometrical problems could solved using standard compass straightedge construction curves include

conic sections deeply studied apollonius perga
cissoid diocles studied diocles used method double cube4
conchoid nicomedes studied nicomedes method double cube trisect angle5
archimedean spiral studied archimedes method trisect angle square circle6
spiric sections sections tori studied perseus sections cones studied apollonius





analytic geometry allowed curves folium descartes defined using equations instead geometrical construction


fundamental advance theory curves advent analytic geometry seventeenth century enabled curve described using equation rather elaborate geometrical construction allowed curves defined studied enabled formal distinction made curves defined using algebraic equations algebraic curves cannot transcendental curves previously curves described geometrical mechanical according supposedly could generated1
conic sections applied astronomy kepler newton also worked early example calculus variations solutions variational problems brachistochrone tautochrone questions introduced properties curves ways case cycloid catenary gets name solution problem hanging chain sort question became routinely accessible means differential calculus
eighteenth century came beginnings theory plane algebraic curves general newton studied cubic curves general description real points ovals statement bézouts theorem showed number aspects directly accessible geometry time singular points complex solutions
since nineteenth century separate theory curves rather appearance curves onedimensional aspect projective geometry differential geometry later topology example jordan curve theorem understood quite deep well required complex analysis spacefilling curves finally provoked modern definitions curve
