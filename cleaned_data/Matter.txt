matter usually classified three classical states plasma sometimes added fourth state bottom quartz solid water liquid nitrogen dioxide plasma globe plasma


classical physics observed everyday life matter substance mass takes space volume includes atoms anything made energy phenomena waves light sound12 generally however modern physics matter fundamental concept universal definition elusive example elementary constituents atoms point particles volume individually
everyday objects bump touch squeeze ultimately composed atoms ordinary atomic matter turn made interacting subatomic particles—usually nucleus protons neutrons cloud orbiting electrons34 typically science considers composite particles matter rest mass volume contrast massless particles photons considered matter neither rest mass volume however particles rest mass classical volume since fundamental particles quarks leptons sometimes equated matter considered point particles effective size volume nevertheless quarks leptons together make ordinary matter interactions contribute effective volume composite particles make ordinary matter
matter exists states phases classical solid liquid well exotic plasma bose–einstein condensates fermionic condensates quark–gluon plasma5

quarks leptons definition elementary composite particles made quarks purple leptons green would matter—while gauge bosons would matter however interaction energy inherent composite particles example gluons involved neutrons protons contribute mass ordinary matter


seen discussion many early definitions called ordinary matter based upon structure building blocks scale elementary particles definition follows tradition stated ordinary matter everything composed quarks leptons ordinary matter everything composed elementary fermions except antiquarks antileptons131415 connection formulations follows
leptons famous electron quarks baryons protons neutrons made combine form atoms turn form molecules atoms molecules said matter natural phrase definition ordinary matter anything made things atoms molecules made however notice also make building blocks matter atoms molecules electrons leptons protons neutrons made quarks definition turn leads definition matter quarks leptons four types elementary fermions antiquarks antileptons considered antimatter described later carithers grannis state ordinary matter composed entirely firstgeneration particles namely quarks plus electron neutrino14 higher generations particles quickly decay firstgeneration particles thus commonly encountered16
definition ordinary matter subtle first appears particles make ordinary matter leptons quarks elementary fermions force carriers elementary bosons17 bosons mediate weak force made quarks leptons ordinary matter even mass18 words mass something exclusive ordinary matter
quark–lepton definition ordinary matter however identifies elementary building blocks matter also includes composites made constituents atoms molecules example composites contain interaction energy holds constituents together constitute bulk mass composite example great extent mass atom simply masses constituent protons neutrons electrons however digging deeper protons neutrons made quarks bound together gluon fields dynamics quantum chromodynamics gluons fields contribute significantly mass hadrons19 words composes mass ordinary matter binding energy quarks within protons neutrons20 example mass three quarks nucleon approximately 7001125000000000000♠125 mevc2 compared mass nucleon approximately 7002938000000000000♠938 mevc22122 bottom line mass everyday objects comes interaction energy elementary components
standard model groups matter particles three generations generation consists quarks leptons first generation quarks electron electron neutrino second includes charm strange quarks muon muon neutrino third generation consists bottom quarks neutrino23 natural explanation would quarks leptons higher generations excited states first generations turns case would imply quarks leptons composite particles rather elementary particles24
quarklepton definition matter also leads described conservation matter laws—discussed later alternatively could return massvolumespace concept matter leading next definition antimatter becomes included subclass matter
based elementary fermions mass volume space
common traditional definition matter anything mass volume occupies space2526 example would said made matter mass volume occupies space
observation matter occupies space goes back antiquity however explanation matter occupies space recent argued result phenomenon described pauli exclusion principle2728 applies fermions particular examples exclusion principle clearly relates matter occupation space white dwarf stars neutron stars discussed
thus matter defined everything composed elementary fermions although dont encounter everyday life antiquarks antiproton antileptons positron antiparticles quark lepton elementary fermions well essentially properties quarks leptons including applicability pauli exclusion principle said prevent particles place time state makes particle take space particular definition leads matter defined include anything made antimatter particles well ordinary quark lepton thus also anything made mesons unstable particles made quark antiquark
general relativity cosmology
context relativity mass additive quantity sense rest masses particles system total rest mass system1 thus relativity usually general view rest masses energy–momentum tensor quantifies amount matter tensor gives rest mass entire system matter therefore sometimes considered anything contributes energy–momentum system anything purely gravity2930 view commonly held fields deal general relativity cosmology view light massless particles fields part matter

historical development
antiquity bc–c
presocratics among first recorded speculators underlying nature visible world thales bc–c regarded water fundamental material world anaximander bc–c posited basic material wholly characterless limitless infinite apeiron anaximenes flourished posited basic stuff pneuma heraclitus 535–c seems basic element fire though perhaps means change empedocles 490–430 spoke four elements everything made earth water fire62 meanwhile parmenides argued change exist democritus argued everything composed minuscule inert bodies shapes called atoms philosophy called atomism notions deep philosophical problems63
aristotle first conception sound philosophical basis natural philosophy especially physics book adopted reasonable suppositions four empedoclean elements added fifth aether nevertheless elements basic aristotles mind rather like everything else visible world composed basic principles matter form

definition matter this—the primary substratum thing comes without qualification persists result
aristotle physics i9192a32

word aristotle uses matter hyle hule literally translated wood timber material building65 indeed aristotles conception matter intrinsically linked something made composed words contrast early modern conception matter simply occupying space matter aristotle definitionally linked process change matter underlies change substance example horse eats grass horse changes grass grass persist horse aspect it—its matter—does matter specifically described atoms consists whatever persists change substance grass horse matter understanding exist independently substance exists interdependently principle form insofar underlies change helpful conceive relationship matter form similar parts whole aristotle matter receive actuality form activity actuality similar parts existence whole otherwise would independent wholes
seventeenth eighteenth centuries
rené descartes 1596–1650 originated modern conception matter primarily geometer instead like aristotle deducing existence matter physical reality change descartes arbitrarily postulated matter abstract mathematical substance occupies space

extension length breadth depth constitutes nature bodily substance thought constitutes nature thinking substance everything else attributable body presupposes extension mode extended
rené descartes principles philosophy66

descartes matter property extension activity aside locomotion exclude bodies67 mechanical philosophy descartes makes absolute distinction mind defines unextended thinking substance matter defines unthinking extended substance68 independent things contrast aristotle defines matter formalforming principle complementary principles together compose independent thing substance short aristotle defines matter roughly speaking things actually made potential independent existence descartes elevates matter actual independent thing
continuity difference descartes aristotles conceptions noteworthy conceptions matter passive inert respective conceptions matter different relationships intelligence aristotle matter intelligence form exist together interdependent relationship whereas descartes matter intelligence mind definitionally opposed independent substances69
descartes justification restricting inherent qualities matter extension permanence real criterion permanence equally applied color resistance desire geometry explain material properties70 like descartes hobbes boyle locke argued inherent properties bodies limited extension socalled secondary qualities like color products human perception71
isaac newton 1643–1727 inherited descartes mechanical conception matter third rules reasoning philosophy newton lists universal qualities matter extension hardness impenetrability mobility inertia72 similarly optics conjectures created matter solid massy hard impenetrable movable particles even hard never wear break pieces73 primary properties matter amenable mathematical description unlike secondary qualities color taste like descartes newton rejected essential nature secondary qualities74
newton developed descartes notion matter restoring matter intrinsic properties addition extension least limited basis mass newtons gravitational force worked distance effectively repudiated descartes mechanics interactions happened exclusively contact75
though newtons gravity would seem power bodies newton admit essential property matter carrying logic forward consistently joseph priestley 17331804 argued corporeal properties transcend contact mechanics chemical properties require capacity attraction75 argued matter inherent powers besides socalled primary qualities descartes al76
