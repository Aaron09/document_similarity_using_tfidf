teams devised strategies address problem rotation specialization accommodate playing nearly every team include group pitchers start games rotate allowing pitcher rest days starts teams roster starting pitchers usually even terms skill exceptional pitchers highly sought professional ranks draw large salaries thus teams seldom stock slot rotation topquality pitchers
best starter teams rotation called usually followed rotation starters would pitch barring injury exceptional circumstances usually pitcher starts opening aces also preferred start crucial games late season playoffs sometimes asked pitch shorter rest team feels would effective starter typically rotation starting pitcher weaker compared others staff starter seen cutoff starting staff bullpen team designated starter sometimes known spot starter role shift cycle cycle members bullpen triplea starters differences rotation setup could also tactical considerations well alternating right lefthanded pitchers order throw teams hitting gametogame series
teams additional pitchers reserved replace games starting pitcher tires proves ineffective players called relief pitchers relievers collectively bullpen starter begins tire starting give hits runs call made bullpen reliever start warm involves reliever starting throw practice balls coach bullpen ready come pitch whenever manager wishes pull current pitcher reliever warm always mean used current pitcher regain composure retire side manager choose another reliever strategy dictates commonly pitching changes occur result pinch hitter used late innings game especially pitcher batting lineup designated hitter reliever would come bullpen pitch next inning
making pitching change manager come mound call pitcher next pitcher throws manager pitching coach also come discuss strategy pitcher second trip mound pitcher inning pitcher come relief pitchers often even specialized roles particular reliever used depends situation many teams designate pitcher closer relief pitcher specifically reserved pitch final inning innings game team narrow lead order preserve victory relief roles include setup middle relievers lefthanded specialists long relievers generally relievers pitch fewer innings throw fewer pitches starters usually pitch frequently without need several days rest appearances relief pitchers typically guys special stuff meaning really effective pitches different style delivery makes batter different pitching attempt example sidearm submarine pitcher
