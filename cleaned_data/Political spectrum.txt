historical origin termsedit
terms right left refer political affiliations originating early french revolutionary 1789–1799 referred originally seating arrangements various legislative bodies france seen speakers seat front assembly aristocracy right traditionally seat honor commoners left hence terms rightwing politics leftwing politics
originally defining point ideological spectrum ancien régime order right thus implied support aristocratic royal interests church left implied support republicanism secularism civil liberties4 political franchise start revolution relatively narrow original left represented mainly interests bourgeoisie rising capitalist class notable exceptions protocommunist gracchus babeuf support laissezfaire commerce free markets expressed politicians sitting left represented policies favorable capitalists rather aristocracy outside parliamentary politics views often characterized right
reason apparent contradiction lies fact left parliamentary left outside official parliamentary structures sansculottes french revolution typically represent much working class poor peasantry unemployed political interests french revolution opposition aristocracy found allied early capitalists however mean economic interests laissezfaire policies representing politically
capitalist economies developed aristocracy became less relevant mostly replaced capitalist representatives size working class increased capitalism expanded began find expression partly trade unionist socialist anarchist communist politics rather confined capitalist policies expressed original left evolution often pulled parliamentary politicians away laissezfaire economic policies although happened different degrees different countries
thus word left american political parlance refer liberalism identified democratic party whereas country france positions would regarded relatively rightwing left likely refer socialist positions rather liberal ones
academic investigationedit
almost century social scientists considered problem best describe political variation
leonard fergusonedit
1950 leonard ferguson analyzed political values using scales measuring attitudes toward birth control capital punishment censorship communism evolution patriotism theism treatment criminals submitting results factor analysis able identify three factors named religionism humanitarianism nationalism defined religionism belief negative attitudes toward evolution birth control humanitarianism related attitudes opposing capital punishment harsh treatment criminals nationalism describing variation opinions censorship patriotism communism
system derived empirically rather devising political model purely theoretical grounds testing fergusons research exploratory result method care must taken interpretation fergusons three factors factor analysis output abstract factor whether objectively real factor exists not5 although replication nationalism factor inconsistent finding religionism humanitarianism number replications ferguson others67
hans eysenckedit
shortly afterward hans eysenck began researching political attitudes great britain believed something essentially similar national socialists nazis hand communists despite opposite positions left–right axis hans eysenck described 1956 book sense nonsense psychology8 eysenck compiled list political statements found newspapers political tracts asked subjects rate agreement disagreement submitting value questionnaire process factor analysis used ferguson eysenck drew factors named radicalism rfactor tendermindedess tfactor
analysis produces factor whether corresponds realworld phenomenon caution must exercised interpretation eysencks rfactor easily identified classical left–right dimension tfactor representing factor drawn right angles rfactor less intuitive highscorers favored pacifism racial equality religious education restrictions abortion lowscorers attitudes friendly militarism harsh punishment easier divorce laws companionate marriage
despite difference methodology location theory results attained eysenck ferguson matched simply rotating eysencks factors degrees renders factors religionism humanitarianism identified ferguson america9
eysencks dimensions found factor analyses values germany sweden10 france9 japan11
interesting result eysenck noted 1956 work united states great britain political variance subsumed leftright axis france taxis larger middle east dimension found taxis among mideastern arabs found toughmindedtenderminded dimension still clearly expressed relationships observed different attitudes nothing corresponds radicalconservative continuum9
relationship eysencks political views political researchedit

subsequent criticism eysencks researchedit
eysencks conception toughmindedness criticized number reasons

virtually values found load toughtender dimension
interpretation toughmindedness manifestation authoritarian versus tenderminded democratic values incompatible frankfurt schools singleaxis model conceptualized authoritarianism fundamental manifestation conservatism many researchers took issue idea leftwing authoritarianism18
theory eysenck developed explain individual variation observed dimensions relating toughmindedness extroversion psychoticism returned ambiguous research results19
eysencks finding nazis communists toughminded members mainstream political movements criticised technical grounds milton rokeach20
eysencks method analysis involves finding abstract dimension factor explains spread given data case scores political survey abstract dimension correspond real material phenomenon obvious problems arise applied human psychology second factor analysis eysencks tfactor second best explanation spread data definition drawn right angles first factor first factor describes bulk variation data likely represent something objectively real subsequent factors become abstract thus would expect find factor roughly corresponds left right dominant framing politics society basis eysencks toughtenderminded thesis second tfactor well represent nothing beyond abstract mathematical construct construct would expected appear factor analysis whether corresponded something real thus rendering eysencks thesis unfalsifiable factor analysis212223

milton rokeachedit
dissatisfied hans eysencks work milton rokeach developed twoaxis model political values 1973 basing ideas freedom equality described book nature human values24
milton rokeach claimed defining difference left right left stressed importance equality right despite criticisms eysencks toughtender axis rokeach also postulated basic similarity communism nazism claiming groups would value freedom greatly conventional social democratics democratic socialists capitalists would wrote value model presented resembles eysencks hypothesis24
test model milton rokeach colleagues used content analysis works exemplifying nazism written adolf hitler communism written vladimir lenin capitalism barry goldwater socialism written various socialist authors method criticized reliance experimenters familiarity content analysis dependence researchers particular political outlooks
multiple raters made frequency counts sentences containing synonyms number values identified rokeach—including freedom equality—and rokeach analyzed results comparing relative frequency rankings values four texts

socialists socialism freedom ranked equality ranked
hitler nazism freedom ranked 16th equality ranked 17th
goldwater capitalism freedom ranked equality ranked 16th
