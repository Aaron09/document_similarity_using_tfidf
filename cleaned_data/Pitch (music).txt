perception pitchedit
pitch frequencyedit
pitch auditory sensation listener assigns musical tones relative positions musical scale based primarily perception frequency vibration6 pitch closely related frequency equivalent frequency objective scientific attribute measured pitch persons subjective perception sound wave cannot directly measured however necessarily mean people wont agree notes higher lower
sound waves pitch oscillations measured obtain frequency takes sentient mind internal quality pitch however pitches usually associated thus quantified frequencies cycles second hertz comparing sounds pure tones periodic sinusoidal waveforms complex aperiodic sound waves often assigned pitch method789
according american national standards institute pitch auditory attribute sound according sounds ordered scale high since pitch close proxy frequency almost entirely determined quickly sound wave making vibrate almost nothing intensity amplitude wave high pitch means rapid oscillation pitch corresponds slower oscillation despite idiom relating vertical height sound pitch shared languages10 least english many deep conceptual metaphors involve updown exact etymological history musical sense high pitch still unclear evidence humans actually perceive source sound slightly higher lower vertical space sound frequency increased reduced10
cases pitch complex sounds speech musical notes corresponds nearly repetition rate periodic nearlyperiodic sounds reciprocal time interval repeating similar events sound waveform89
pitch complex tones ambiguous meaning different pitches perceived depending upon observer5 actual fundamental frequency precisely determined physical measurement differ perceived pitch overtones also known upper partials harmonic otherwise complex tone composed sine waves 1000 1200 sometimes heard three pitches spectral pitches 1000 1200 derived physical frequencies pure tones combination tone corresponding repetition rate waveform situation like percept commonly referred missing fundamental often greatest common divisor frequencies present11
pitch depends lesser degree sound pressure level loudness volume tone especially frequencies 1000 2000 pitch lower tones gets lower sound pressure increases instance tone loud seems semitone lower pitch barely audible 2000 pitch gets higher sound gets louder12
theories pitch perceptionedit
theories pitch perception explain physical sound specific physiology auditory system work together yield experience pitch general pitch perception theories divided place coding temporal coding place theory holds perception pitch determined place maximum excitation basilar membrane
place code taking advantage tonotopy auditory system must effect perception high frequencies since neurons upper limit fast phaselock action potentials6 however purely placebased theory cannot account accuracy pitch perception middle frequency ranges
temporal theories offer alternative appeals temporal structure action potentials mostly phaselocking modelocking action potentials frequencies stimulus precise temporal structure helps code pitch higher levels still debated processing seems based autocorrelation action potentials auditory nerve13 however long noted neural mechanism accomplish delay—a necessary operation true autocorrelation—has found6 least model shows temporal delay unnecessary produce autocorrelation model pitch perception appealing phase shifts cochlear filters14 however earlier work shown certain sounds prominent peak autocorrelation function elicit corresponding pitch percept1516 certain sounds without peak autocorrelation function nevertheless elicit pitch1718 complete model autocorrelation must therefore apply signals represent output cochlea auditorynerve interspikeinterval histograms16 theories pitch perception hold pitch inherent octave ambiguities therefore best decomposed pitch chroma periodic value around octave like note names western music—and pitch height ambiguous indicates octave pitch
justnoticeable differenceedit
justnoticeable difference threshold change perceived depends tones frequency content sine waves complex tones 1000 sine waves cents19 typically tested playing tones quick succession listener asked difference pitches12 becomes smaller tones played simultaneously listener able discern beat frequencies total number perceptible pitch steps range human hearing 1400 total number notes equaltempered scale 16000 12012
aural illusionsedit
relative perception pitch fooled resulting aural illusions several tritone paradox notably shepard scale continuous discrete sequence specially formed tones made sound sequence continues ascending descending forever
definite indefinite pitchedit
musical instruments make notes clear pitch unpitched percussion instrument class percussion instrument produce particular pitches sound note definite pitch listener possibly relatively easily discern pitch sounds definite pitch harmonic frequency spectra close harmonic spectra12
sound generated instrument produces many modes vibration occur simultaneously listener hears numerous frequencies vibration lowest frequency called fundamental frequency frequencies overtones20 harmonics important class overtones frequencies integer multiples fundamental whether higher frequencies integer multiples collectively called partials referring different parts make total spectrum
sound note indefinite pitch listener finds impossible relatively difficult identify pitch sounds indefinite pitch harmonic spectra altered harmonic spectra—a characteristic known inharmonicity
still possible sounds indefinite pitch clearly higher lower another instance snare drum sounds higher pitched bass drum though indefinite pitch sound contains higher frequencies words possible often easy roughly discern relative pitches sounds indefinite pitch sounds indefinite pitch neatly correspond specific pitch special type pitch often occurs free nature sound reaches observer directly source also reflecting soundreflecting surface phenomenon called repetition pitch addition true repetition original sound basic prerequisite

standard pitch widely accepted convention middle usually often written sometimes a440 although frequencies also often used variants another standard pitch socalled baroque pitch 20th century hz—approximately equaltempered semitone lower a440 facilitate transposition
transposing instruments origin variety pitch standards modern times conventionally parts transposed different keys voices instruments even result musicians need refer particular pitch unambiguous manner talking
example common type clarinet trumpet playing note written part sounds pitch called nontransposing instrument like violin indicates time wind instruments played standard pitch tone lower violin pitch refer pitch unambiguously musician calls concert meaning pitch someone playing nontransposing instrument like violin calls
