peano axioms arithmetic satisfied
questioned existenceedit
axiomatic theoryedit
zermelo theory existence empty assured axiom empty uniqueness follows axiom extensionality however axiom empty shown redundant either ways

already axiom implying existence least given axiom together axiom separation existence empty easily proved
presence urelements easy prove least exists urelements assuming proper class given axiom separation empty easily proved

philosophical issuesedit
empty standard widely accepted mathematical concept remains ontological curiosity whose meaning usefulness debated philosophers logicians
empty thing nothing rather nothing inside always something issue overcome viewing bag—an empty undoubtedly still exists darling 2004 explains empty nothing rather triangles four sides numbers bigger nine smaller eight opening moves chess involve king5
popular syllogism

nothing better eternal happiness sandwich better nothing therefore sandwich better eternal happiness

often used demonstrate philosophical relation concept nothing empty darling writes contrast seen rewriting statements nothing better eternal happiness sandwich better nothing mathematical tone according darling former equivalent things better eternal happiness






displaystyle varnothing

latter sandwich better






displaystyle varnothing

noted first compares elements sets second compares sets themselves5
jonathan lowe argues empty

undoubtedly important landmark history mathematics assume utility calculation dependent upon actually denoting object

also case

ever informed empty members unique amongst sets members however many things members settheoretical sense—namely nonsets perfectly clear things members sets unclear uniquely amongst sets members cannot conjure entity existence mere stipulation6

george boolos argued much heretofore obtained theory easily obtained plural quantification individuals without reifying sets singular entities entities members7
