common usesedit
many programming languages defined data type byte
programming languages define byte addressable unit data storage large enough hold member basic character execution environment clause standard standard requires integral data type unsigned char must hold least different values represented least eight bits clause 52421 various implementations reserve bits storage byte2425b addition standards require gaps bytes means every memory part byte26
javas primitive byte data type always defined consisting bits signed data type holding values −128
programming languages define unsigned byte signed sbyte holding values −128 respectively
data transmission systems byte defined contiguous sequence bits serial data stream representing smallest distinguished unit data transmission unit might include start bits stop bits parity bits thus could vary bits contain single 7bit ascii code27
