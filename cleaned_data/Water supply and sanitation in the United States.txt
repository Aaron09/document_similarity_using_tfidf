historyedit
also history water supply sanitation
19th century numerous american cities afflicted major outbreaks disease including cholera 1832 1849 1866 typhoid 184817 fastgrowing cities sewers relied contaminated wells within city confines drinking water supply mid19th century many cities built centralized water supply systems however initially systems provided river water without treatment john snow established link contaminated water disease 1854 authorities became gradually convinced link water treatment plants added public health improved sewers built since 1850s initially based erroneous belief miasma theory caused cholera typhoid took 1890s universally accepted germ theory disease prevail
however wastewater still discharged without treatment wastewater believed harmful receiving waters natural dilution selfpurifying capacity rivers lakes wastewater treatment became widespread introduction federal funding 1948 especially increase environmental consciousness upscaling financing 1970s decades federal funding water supply sanitation provided grants local governments 1987 system changed loans revolving funds
piped water supply 1948edit
1840s 1850s largest cities built pipelines supply drinking water rivers lakes however drinking water initially treated since link waterborne pathogens diseases well known 1842 york city first cities water resources outside city limits dammed croton river westchester county york built aqueduct reservoir city18 also 1842 construction completed chicagos first water works water mains made cedar water intake located feet lake michigan19 1848 boston began construction water transmission system tributary sudbury river impounded creating lake cochituate cochituate aqueduct transported water brookline reservoir citys distribution system20 1853 washington followed suit beginning construction washington aqueduct provide water great falls potomac river21
1854 british physician john snow found cholera spread contaminated water result findings several cities began treat water sand filters chlorine distributing public cities also began construct sewers22 result water treatment sanitation incidence cholera typhoid rapidly decreased slow sand filtration initially technology choice water treatment later gradually displaced rapid sand filtration
arid american southwest water demand rapidly growing cities angeles exceeded local water availability requiring construction large pipelines bring water faraway sources spectacular example first angeles aqueduct built 1905 1913 supply water owens valley distance
sanitation 1948edit
first sewer systems united states built combined sewers carrying storm water sewerage discharged rivers lakes without treatment main reason choosing combined sewers separate systems separating sanitary sewers storm water drains belief combined sewer systems cheaper build separate systems also european precedent successful separate sewer systems time17 first largescale sewer systems united states constructed chicago brooklyn late 1850s followed major cities17
sewage treatment facilities constructed late 19th century treat combined wastewater associated difficulties cities wastewater treatment works 1892 treating wastewater land application cities separate sanitary storm water sewer systems thus facilitating wastewater treatment need large capacitites accommodate weather flows furthermore belief diluted combined wastewater harmful receiving waters natural dilution selfpurifying capacity rivers lakes sea17 early 20th century debate evolved thought best interest public health construct wastewater treatment facilities believed building unnecessary nevertheless many cities began separate sewer systems creating favorable conditions adding wastewater treatment plants future17
wastewater treated typically discharged rivers lakes however 1932 first reclaimed water facility built golden gate park francisco reuse treated wastewater landscape irrigation
sanitary sewers sanitation solution applied particularly useful highdensity urban areas however newly built lowerdensity areas decentralized septic systems built attractive reduced capital expenditures fewer operation maintenance costs compared wastewater treatment plants17

disagreements federal government local government appropriate level wastewater treatment former arguing stringent standards example late 1980s city diego involved legal dispute requirement treat sewage point loma wastewater treatment plant secondary treatment standards city prevailed saying saved ratepayers estimated billion process proved successful maintaining healthy ocean environment point loma plant uses advanced primary process26 requirement perform secondary treatment wastewater ocean discharge waived 1995 taking account citys unique circumstances27
1987 congress passed water quality replaced construction grant program system subsidized loans using clean water state revolving fund cwsrf28 intention time completely phase federal funding years funding peaked 1991 continued high levels thereafter despite original intentions challenges arose need address combined sewer overflows issued policy 199429 1996 congress established drinking water state revolving fund building success cwsrf order finance investments improve compliance stringent drinking water quality standards30

water scarcity climate changeedit
water united states increasing every year many regions starting feel pressure least states anticipating local regional statewide water shortages 2013 even nondrought conditions89
according national academies climate change affects water supply following ways

rising water demands hotter summers mean thirstier people plants addition evaporation reservoirs irrigated farmland lead faster depletion water supplies
increased drought scientific evidence suggests rising temperatures southwestern united states reduce river flows contribute increased severity frequency duration droughts
seasonal supply reductions many utilities depend winter snowpack store water gradually release snowmelt spring summer warmer temperatures accelerate snowmelt causing bulk runoff occur earlier potentially increasing water storage needs areas9
