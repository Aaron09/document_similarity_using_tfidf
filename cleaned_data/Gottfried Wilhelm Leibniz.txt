identitycontradiction proposition true negation false vice versa
identity indiscernibles distinct things cannot properties common every predicate possessed also possessed vice versa entities identical suppose things indiscernible suppose thing names frequently invoked modern logic philosophy identity indiscernibles often referred leibnizs attracted controversy criticism especially corpuscular philosophy quantum mechanics
sufficient reason must sufficient reason anything exist event occur truth obtain49

continuity natura facit saltus51 literally nature make jumps
optimism assuredly always chooses best52
