interdisciplinarity involves combining academic disciplines activity research project draws knowledge several fields like sociology anthropology psychology economics creating something thinking across boundaries related interdiscipline interdisciplinary field organizational unit crosses traditional boundaries academic disciplines schools thought needs professions emerge large engineering teams usually interdisciplinary power station mobile phone project requires melding several specialties however term interdisciplinary sometimes confined academic settings
term interdisciplinary applied within education training pedagogies describe studies methods insights several established disciplines traditional fields study interdisciplinarity involves researchers students teachers goals connecting integrating several academic schools thought professions technologies—along specific perspectives—in pursuit common task epidemiology aids global warming requires understanding diverse disciplines solve complex problems interdisciplinary applied subject felt neglected even misrepresented traditional disciplinary structure research institutions example womens studies ethnic area studies interdisciplinarity likewise applied complex subjects understood combining perspectives fields
adjective interdisciplinary often used educational circles researchers disciplines pool approaches modify better suited problem hand including case teamtaught course students required understand given subject terms multiple traditional disciplines example subject land appear differently examined different disciplines instance biology chemistry economics geography politics

although “interdisciplinary” “interdisciplinarity” frequently viewed twentieth century terms concept historical antecedents notably greek philosophy1 julie thompson klein attests roots concepts number ideas resonate modern discourse—the ideas unified science general knowledge synthesis integration knowledge2 giles gunn says greek historians dramatists took elements realms knowledge medicine philosophy understand material3 broadminded humanist project involves interdisciplinarity history shows crowd cases seventeenthcentury leibnizs task create system universal justice required linguistics economics management ethics philosophy politics even sinology4
interdisciplinary programs sometimes arise shared conviction traditional disciplines unable unwilling address important problem example social science disciplines anthropology sociology paid little attention social analysis technology throughout twentieth century result many social scientists interests technology joined science technology society programs typically staffed scholars drawn numerous disciplines also arise research developments nanotechnology cannot addressed without combining approaches disciplines examples include quantum information processing amalgamation quantum physics computer science bioinformatics combining molecular biology computer science sustainable development research area deals problems requiring analysis synthesis across economic social environmental spheres often integration multiple social natural science disciplines interdisciplinary research also study health sciences example studying optimal solutions diseases5 institutions higher education offer accredited degree programs interdisciplinary studies
another level interdisciplinarity seen remedy harmful effects excessive specialization isolation information silos views however interdisciplinarity entirely indebted specialize field study—that without specialists interdisciplinarians would information leading experts consult others place focus interdisciplinarity need transcend disciplines viewing excessive specialization problematic epistemologically politically interdisciplinary collaboration research results solutions problems much information given back various disciplines involved therefore disciplinarians interdisciplinarians seen complementary relation another
barriersedit
participants interdisciplinary ventures trained traditional disciplines must learn appreciate differing perspectives methods example discipline places emphasis quantitative rigor produce practitioners think discipline scientific others turn colleagues softer disciplines associate quantitative approaches inability grasp broader dimensions problem interdisciplinary program succeed members remain stuck disciplines disciplinary attitudes hand disciplinary perspective much interdisciplinary work seen soft lacking rigor ideologically motivated beliefs place barriers career paths choose interdisciplinary work example interdisciplinary grant applications often refereed peer reviewers drawn established disciplines surprisingly interdisciplinary researchers experience difficulty getting funding research addition untenured researchers know seek promotion tenure likely evaluators lack commitment interdisciplinarity fear making commitment interdisciplinary research increase risk denied tenure
interdisciplinary programs fail given sufficient autonomy example interdisciplinary faculty usually recruited joint appointment responsibilities interdisciplinary program womens studies traditional discipline history traditional discipline makes tenure decisions interdisciplinary faculty hesitant commit fully interdisciplinary work barriers include generally disciplinary orientation scholarly journals leading perception fact interdisciplinary research hard publish addition since traditional budgetary practices universities channel resources disciplines becomes difficult account given scholar teachers salary time periods budgetary contraction natural tendency serve primary constituency students majoring traditional discipline makes resources scarce teaching research comparatively center discipline traditionally understood reasons introduction interdisciplinary programs often resisted perceived competition diminishing funds
barriers interdisciplinary research areas strongly motivated become disciplines succeed establish research funding programs make tenure promotion decisions lower risk entry examples former interdisciplinary research areas become disciplines many named parent disciplines include neuroscience cybernetics biochemistry biomedical engineering fields occasionally referred interdisciplines hand even though interdisciplinary activities focus attention institutions promoting learning teaching well organizational social entities concerned education practically facing complex barriers serious challenges criticism important obstacles challenges faced interdisciplinary activities past decades divided professional organizational cultural obstacles6

initial distinction made interdisciplinary studies found spread across academy today study interdisciplinarity involves much smaller group researchers former instantiated thousands research centers across world latter organization association interdisciplinary studies7 founded 1979 international organizations international network inter transdisciplinarity8 founded 2010 philosophy ofas interdisciplinarity network9 founded 2009 research institute devoted theory practice interdisciplinarity center study interdisciplinarity university north texas founded 2008 september 2014 center study interdisciplinarity ceased exist result administrative decisions university north texas10
interdisciplinary study academic program process seeking synthesize broad perspectives knowledge skills interconnections epistemology educational setting interdisciplinary programs founded order facilitate study subjects coherence cannot adequately understood single disciplinary perspective example womens studies medieval studies rarely advanced level interdisciplinarity become focus study critique institutionalized disciplines ways segmenting knowledge
contrast studies interdisciplinarity raise selfconsciousness questions interdisciplinarity works nature history disciplinarity future knowledge postindustrial society researchers center study interdisciplinarity made distinction philosophy interdisciplinarity former identifying discrete area within philosophy raises epistemological metaphysical questions status interdisciplinary thinking latter pointing toward philosophical practice sometimes called field philosophy1112
perhaps common complaint regarding interdisciplinary programs supporters detractors alike lack synthesis—that students provided multiple disciplinary perspectives given effective guidance resolving conflicts achieving coherent view subject others argued idea synthesis integration disciplines presupposes questionable politicoepistemic commitments13 critics interdisciplinary programs feel ambition simply unrealistic given knowledge intellectual maturity exceptional undergraduate defenders concede difficulty insist cultivating interdisciplinarity habit mind even level possible essential education informed engaged citizens leaders capable analyzing evaluating synthesizing information multiple sources order render reasoned decisions
much written philosophy promise interdisciplinarity academic programs professional practice social scientists increasingly interrogating academic discourses interdisciplinarity well interdisciplinarity actually works—and not—in practice141516 shown example interdisciplinary enterprises serve society produce deleterious outcomes held account17

efforts simplify defend conceptedit
article social science journal19 attempts provide simple commonsense definition interdisciplinarity bypassing difficulties defining concept obviating need related concepts transdisciplinarity pluridisciplinarity multidisciplinarity

begin discipline conveniently defined comparatively selfcontained isolated domain human experience possesses community experts interdisciplinarity best seen bringing together distinctive components disciplines academic discourse interdisciplinarity typically applies four realms knowledge research education theory interdisciplinary knowledge involves familiarity components disciplines interdisciplinary research combines components disciplines search creation knowledge operations artistic expressions interdisciplinary education merges components disciplines single program instruction interdisciplinary theory takes interdisciplinary knowledge research education main objects study

turn interdisciplinary richness instances knowledge research education ranked weighing four variables number disciplines involved distance novelty particular combination extent integration20
interdisciplinary knowledge research important

creativity often requires interdisciplinary knowledge
immigrants often make important contributions field
disciplinarians often commit errors best detected people familiar disciplines
worthwhile topics research fall interstices among traditional disciplines
many intellectual social practical problems require interdisciplinary approaches
interdisciplinary knowledge research serve remind unityofknowledge ideal
interdisciplinarians enjoy greater flexibility research
narrow disciplinarians interdisciplinarians often treat intellectual equivalent traveling lands
interdisciplinarians help breach communication gaps modern academy thereby helping mobilize enormous intellectual resources cause greater social rationality justice
bridging fragmented disciplines interdisciplinarians might play role defense academic freedom19
