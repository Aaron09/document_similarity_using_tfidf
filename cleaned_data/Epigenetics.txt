epigenetic mechanisms


epigenetics study heritable changes gene function involve changes sequence1 greek prefix outside around epigenetics implies features addition traditional genetic basis inheritance2 epigenetics often refers changes chromosome affect gene activity expression also used describe heritable phenotypic change derive modification genome prions effects cellular physiological phenotypic traits result external environmental factors part normal developmental program standard definition epigenetics requires alterations heritable34 either progeny cells organisms
term also refers changes functionally relevant changes genome involve change nucleotide sequence examples mechanisms produce changes methylation histone modification alters genes expressed without altering underlying sequence gene expression controlled action repressor proteins attach silencer regions epigenetic changes last cell divisions duration cells life also last multiple generations even though involve changes underlying sequence organism5 instead nongenetic factors cause organisms genes behave express differently6
example epigenetic change eukaryotic biology process cellular differentiation morphogenesis totipotent stem cells become various pluripotent cell lines embryo turn become fully differentiated cells words single fertilized cell zygote continues divide resulting daughter cells change different cell types organism including neurons muscle cells epithelium endothelium blood vessels activating genes inhibiting expression others7
