canbus node


node requires

central processing unit microprocessor host processor

host processor decides received messages mean messages wants transmit
sensors actuators control devices connected host processor


controller often integral part microcontroller

receiving controller stores received serial bits entire message available fetched host processor usually controller triggering interrupt
sending host processor sends transmit messages controller transmits bits serially onto free


transceiver defined 1189823 medium access unit standards

receiving converts data stream canbus levels levels controller uses usually protective circuitry protect controller
transmitting converts data stream controller canbus levels



node able send receive messages simultaneously message frame consists primarily identifier represents priority message eight data bytes acknowledge slot overhead also part message improved extends length data section bytes frame message transmitted serially onto using nonreturntozero format received nodes
devices connected network typically sensors actuators control devices devices connected host processor controller transceiver
data transmissionedit
data transmission uses lossless bitwise arbitration method contention resolution arbitration method requires nodes network synchronized sample every network time call synchronous unfortunately term synchronous imprecise since data transmitted without clock signal asynchronous format
specifications terms dominant bits recessive bits dominant logical actively driven voltage transmitter recessive logical passively returned voltage resistor idle state represented recessive level logical node transmits dominant another node transmits recessive collision dominant wins means delay higherpriority message node transmitting lower priority message automatically attempts retransmit clocks dominant message makes suitable real time prioritized communications system
exact voltages logical depend physical layer used basic principle requires node listens data network including transmitting nodes logical transmitted transmitting nodes time logical seen nodes including transmitting nodes receiving nodes logical transmitted transmitting nodes time logical seen nodes logical transmitted nodes logical transmitted nodes logical seen nodes including nodes transmitting logical node transmits logical sees logical realizes contention quits transmitting using process node transmits logical another node transmits logical drops loses arbitration node loses arbitration requeues message later transmission frame bitstream continues without error node left transmitting means node transmits first loses arbitration since identifier transmitted nodes start frame node lowest identifier transmits zeros start frame node wins arbitration highest priority
example consider 11bit network nodes binary representation 00000001111 binary representation 00000010000 nodes transmit time first transmit start transmit first zeros arbitration decision made

allocationedit
message must unique single otherwise nodes would continue transmission beyond arbitration field causing error
early 1990s choice messages done simply basis identifying type data sending node however also used message priority poor realtime performance scenarios utilization circa commonly required ensure messages would meet deadlines however instead determined based deadline message lower numerical hence higher message priority utilizations typically achieved message deadlines missed
timingedit
nodes network must operate nominal rate noise phase shifts oscillator tolerance oscillator drift mean actual rate nominal rate9 since separate clock signal used means synchronizing nodes necessary synchronization important arbitration since nodes arbitration must able transmitted data nodes transmitted data time synchronization also important ensure variations oscillator timing nodes cause errors
synchronization starts hard synchronization first recessive dominant transition period idle start resynchronization occurs every recessive dominant transition frame controller expects transition occur multiple nominal time transition occur exact time controller expects controller adjusts nominal time accordingly
adjustment accomplished dividing number time slices called quanta assigning number quanta four segments within synchronization propagation phase segment phase segment



example timing time quanta



number quanta divided vary controller number quanta assigned segment varied depending rate network conditions
transition occurs expected causes controller calculate time difference lengthen phase segment shorten phase segment time effectively adjusts timing receiver transmitter synchronize resynchronization process done continuously every recessive dominant transition ensure transmitter receiver stay sync continuously resynchronizing reduces errors induced noise allows receiving node synchronized node lost arbitration resynchronize node arbitration
