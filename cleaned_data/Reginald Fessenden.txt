early workedit
fessendens classical education provided limited amount scientific technical training interested increasing skills electrical field moved york city 1886 hopes gaining employment famous inventor thomas edison however initial attempts rebuffed first application fessenden wrote know anything electricity learn pretty quick edison replied enough know electricity however fessenden persevered year hired semiskilled position assistant tester edison machine works laying underground electrical mains york city quickly proved worth received series promotions increasing responsibility project late 1886 fessenden began working directly edison inventors laboratory west orange jersey junior technician5 participated broad range projects included work solving problems chemistry metallurgy electricity however 1890 facing financial problems edison forced laboratory employees including fessenden6 fessenden remained admirer edison entire life 1925 stated figure history stands rank inventor archimedes7
taking advantage recent practical experience fessenden able find positions series manufacturing companies 1892 received appointment professor newly formed electrical engineering department purdue university west lafayette indiana helped westinghouse corporation install lighting 1893 chicago world columbian exposition later year george westinghouse personally recruited fessenden newly created position chair electrical engineering department western university pennsylvania pittsburgh89
radio workedit
late 1890s reports began appear success guglielmo marconi developing practical system transmitting receiving radio signals commonly known wireless telegraphy fessenden began limited radio experimentation soon came conclusion could develop efficient system sparkgap transmitter cohererreceiver combination created oliver lodge marconi 1899 able send radiotelegraph messages pittsburgh allegheny city using receiver design10
weather bureau contractedit
1900 fessenden left pittsburgh work united states weather bureau objective proving practicality using network coastal radio stations transmit weather information wirelessly thereby avoiding expense existing telegraph lines provisions contract called paid 3000 year provided work space assistance housing11 agreement gave weather bureau access devices fessenden developed would retain ownership inventions fessenden quickly made major advances especially receiver design worked develop audio reception signals initial success came invention barretter detector followed electrolytic detector consisted fine wire dipped nitric acid next years latter device would standard sensitivity radio reception
work progressed fessenden also developed heterodyne principle reception used closely spaced radio signals produce audible tone made morse code transmissions much easier hear however heterodyne reception would become practical decade invented required method producing stable local signal would become available development oscillating vacuumtube

fessendens initial weather bureau work took place cobb island maryland located potomac river kilometers downstream washington experimentation expanded additional stations built along atlantic coast north carolina virginia however midst promising advances fessenden became embroiled disputes sponsor particular charged bureau chief willis moore attempted gain halfshare patents fessenden refused sign rights work weather bureau ended august 190212
national electric signaling companyedit
november 1902 wealthy pittsburgh pennsylvania businessmen walker thomas given financed formation national electric signaling company nesco support fessendens research initially company based washington station constructed experimental demonstration purposes additional demonstration stations constructed collinswood jersey near philadelphia jersey city jersey near york city13 efforts sell equipment governments well private companies little success ongoing area conflict especially navy high prices fessenden tried charge navy particular felt fessendens quotes devices manufacturing costs considered reasonable contracted companies build equipment used fessenden designs feelings series patent infringement lawsuits alternate plan sell company whole unsuccessful finding buyer
eventually radical change company orientation took place 1904 decided compete existing ocean cables setting transatlantic radiotelegraph link headquarters company operations moved brant rock massachusetts western terminal proposed service14

audio transmissionsedit
fessenden early interest possibility making audio radio transmissions contrast early sparkgap transmissions could transmit morse code messages early 1891 investigated sending alternating currents varying frequencies along telegraph lines order create multiplex telegraph system18 would later apply knowledge gained tuning resonance alternating current electrical work higher frequency currents used radio order develop concept continuouswave radio signals
fessendens basic approach disclosed patent 706737 applied 1901 issued next year called highspeed alternator referred alternatingcurrent dynamo generated pure sine waves produced continuous train radiant waves substantially uniform strength modern terminology continuouswave transmitter19 idea using continuouswave radio signals direct conflict current orthodoxy abrupt whiplash effect produced large electrical sparks needed order create adequately strong signals john ambrose fleming marconi associate particularly dismissive book principles electric wave telegraphy detailed review state published 1906 reviewing fessendens patent wrote creation electric wave seems involve certain suddenness beginning oscillations alternator giving simple sinecurve would likely produce required effect20 view fessendens ultimate success statement disappeared books 1916 edition fessendens next step taken standard wiretelephone practice insert simple carbon microphone transmission line used modulate carrier wave signal audio transmissions using modern terms used produce amplitude modulated radio signals
fessenden began research audio transmissions still cobb island continuouswave transmitter initially worked experimental highfrequency spark transmitter taking advantage fact higher spark rate closer sparkgap transmission comes producing continuous waves later reported fall 1900 successfully transmitted speech distance kilometers mile21 appears first successful audio transmission using radio signals however time sound distorted commercially practical although test show refinements would become possible effectively transmit sounds radio22
time fessenden continued working sophisticated highfrequency spark transmitters including versions used compressed began take characteristics arctransmitters patented valdemar poulsen23 fessenden unsuccessfully attempted sell form radiotelephone later noting 1904 20000 frequency spark compressed nitrogen good results obtained demonstration given number electrical engineers signed affidavits considered articulation commercially good twentyfive miles sets advertised sale24 1908 review conceded approach transmission however still absolutely perfect25
alternatortransmitteredit
fessendens ultimate plan audiocapable transmitter take basic electrical alternator normally rotated speeds produced alternating current hundred cyclespersecond greatly increase rotational speed order create electrical currents tensofthousands cyclespersecond thus producing steady continuouswave transmission connected aerial however would take many years expensive development even prototype alternatortransmitter would ready years beyond highpower versions become available concern whether high speeds alternator might disintegrate high rotation speed tearing apart precaution alternator initially developed placed surrounded sandbags26
fessenden contracted general electric help design produce series highfrequency alternatortransmitters 1903 charles proteus steinmetz delivered version proved limited could directly used radio transmitter fessendens request faster powerful unit assigned ernst alexanderson august 1906 delivered improved model operated transmitting frequency approximately although less power fessendens rotaryspark transmitters
alternatortransmitter achieved goal transmitting quality audio signals lack amplify signals meant somewhat weak december 1906 fessenden made extensive demonstration alternatortransmitter brant rock showing utility pointtopoint wireless telephony including interconnecting stations wire telephone network part demonstration speech transmitted kilometers miles listening site plymouth massachusetts detailed review demonstration appeared american telephone journal21 summary fessenden appeared scientific american27 portion report produced greenleaf pickard telephone companys boston office includes additional information still existing defects appeared ernst ruhmers wireless telephony theory practice28
although primarily designed transmissions spanning kilometers couple occasions test brant rock audio transmissions apparently overheard nesco employee james armor across atlantic machrihanish site29
first entertainment radio broadcastedit
early1930s generally accepted forest conducted series test broadcasts beginning 1907 widely quoted promoting potential organized radio broadcasting first person transmit music entertainment radio forests first entertainment broadcast occurred february 1907 transmitted electronic telharmonium music laboratory station york city30 followed tests included fall eugenia farrar singing love truly31 beginning 1904 navy broadcast daily time signals weather reports employed spark transmitters transmitting morse code
1928 part lecture reviewing early history radio united states davis commenting entertainment offerings asserted reginald fessenden probably first attempt broadcast program christmas 190632 didnt provide additional details comment little noticed time
first widely publicized information fessendens early broadcasts appear 1932 article prepared former fessenden associate samuel kintner pittsburghs contributions radio appeared december 1932 issue proceedings institute radio engineers33 reviewed information included january 1932 letter sent fessenden kintner fessenden subsequently died five months kintners article appeared account fessenden reported evening december 1906 christmas made first radio broadcasts music entertainment general audience using alternatortransmitter brant rock fessenden remembered producing short program included phonograph record ombra largo george frideric handel followed fessenden playing adolphe adams carol holy night violin singing adore still gounod closing biblical passage glory highest earth peace good luke also stated second short program broadcast december years intended audience transmissions primarily shipboard radio operators along atlantic seaboard fessenden claimed programs widely publicized advance christmas broadcast heard norfolk virginia year eves broadcast reached listeners west indies34
anticipation 2006 centennial anniversary fessendens reported broadcasts brought renewed interest well additional questions issue despite fessendens assertion programs widely heard appear independent corroborating evidence account even helen fessenden biography relies exclusively details contained january 1932 letter used kintner article general consensus centennial discussions fessenden technical means make broadcasts given widespread reports success december alternatortransmitter demonstrations however stations power even broadcasts taken place questionable range could matched fessendens claim heard hundreds kilometers away
period leading centennial james oneal conducted extensive research find ships radio accounts contemporary literature confirm reported holiday broadcasts35 followup article years later reported similar attempt verify details broadcasts taken place 1956 also failed uncover confirmation fessendens statements alternate possibility proposed oneal perhaps something similar fessenden remembered could taken place series tests conducted 190936 review donna halper christopher sterling suggested debating existence holiday broadcasts ignoring fact opinion december demonstration included playing phonograph record qualified considered entertainment broadcast37 jack belrose flatly argued reason doubt fessendens account part challenged years immediately following publication kintner article38 although fessendens claim first radio broadcast 1906 recognized ieee milestone39 view contrasting opinions among radio historians mike adams summarized situation years possible occurrence fessenden first broadcaster controversy continues40
american telephone journal account december alternatortransmitter demonstration included statement admirably adapted transmission news music owing fact wires needed simultaneous transmission many subscribers effected easily few21 echoing words handout distributed demonstration witnesses stated radio telephony admirably adapted transmitting news stock quotations music race reports simultaneously city account fact wires needed single apparatus distribute thousand subscribers easily proposed erect stations purpose large cities abroad41 however reported holiday transmissions fessenden appear conducted radio broadcasts even given additional thought potential regular broadcast service 1908 comprehensive review wireless telephony included section titled possibilities listed promising radio telephone uses neither main article list makes reference broadcasting instead noting conventional applications pointtopoint communication enumerated local exchanges longdistance lines transmarine transmission wireless telephony ship ship wireless telephone ship local exchange42
continuing work dismissal nescoedit
technical achievements made fessenden matched financial success walker given continued hope sell nesco larger company american telephone telegraph company december 1906 demonstrations said planning acquire nesco financial setbacks caused telephone company reconsider nesco unable find another buyer growing strains fessenden company owners fessendens formation fessenden wireless company canada montreal 1906 suspicion trying freeze walker given potentially lucrative competing transatlantic service final break occurred january 1911 fessenden formally dismissed nesco resulted bringing suit nesco breach contract fessenden initial court trial awarded damages however nesco prevailed appeal conserve assets nesco went receivership 1912 samuel kintner appointed general manager company legal stalemate would continue years 1917 nesco finally emerged receivership soon renamed international radio telegraph company company limped along years sold westinghouse electric manufacturing company 1920 next year assets including numerous important fessenden patents sold radio corporation america also inherited longstanding fessenden legal proceedings finally march 1928 fessenden settled outstanding lawsuits receiving significant cash settlement43
