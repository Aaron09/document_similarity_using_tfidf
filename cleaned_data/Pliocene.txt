charles lyell later charles gave pliocene name principles geology volume 18337 word pliocene comes greek words πλεῖον pleion καινός kainos recent8 means roughly continuation recent referring essentially modern marine mollusc fauna
fowler called term pliocene like geological jargon pleistocene miocene regrettable barbarism indication even good classical scholar lyell requested philologists help coining words9
