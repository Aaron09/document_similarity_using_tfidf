different cancers respond radiation therapy different ways123
response cancer radiation described radiosensitivity highly radiosensitive cancer cells rapidly killed modest doses radiation include leukemias lymphomas germ cell tumors majority epithelial cancers moderately radiosensitive require significantly higher dose radiation 6070 achieve radical cure types cancer notably radioresistant much higher doses required produce radical cure safe clinical practice renal cell cancer melanoma generally considered radioresistant radiation therapy still palliative option many patients metastatic melanoma combining radiation therapy immunotherapy active area investigation shown promise melanoma cancers4
important distinguish radiosensitivity particular tumor extent laboratory measure radiation curability cancer actual clinical practice example leukemias generally curable radiation therapy disseminated body lymphoma radically curable localised area body similarly many common moderately radioresponsive tumors routinely treated curative doses radiation therapy early stage example nonmelanoma skin cancer head neck cancer breast cancer nonsmall cell lung cancer cervical cancer anal cancer prostate cancer metastatic cancers generally incurable radiation therapy possible treat whole body
treatment scan often performed identify tumor surrounding normal structures patient receives small skin marks guide placement treatment fields5 patient positioning crucial stage patient setup identical position treatment many patient positioning devices developed purpose including masks cushions molded patient
response tumor radiation therapy also related size complex radiobiology large tumors respond less well radiation smaller tumors microscopic disease various strategies used overcome effect common technique surgical resection prior radiation therapy commonly seen treatment breast cancer wide local excision mastectomy followed adjuvant radiation therapy another method shrink tumor neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior radical radiation therapy third technique enhance radiosensitivity cancer giving certain drugs course radiation therapy examples radiosensitizing drugs include cisplatin nimorazole cetuximab
effect radiotherapy control cancer shown limited first five years surgery particularly breast cancer difference breast cancer recurrence patients receive radiotherapy dont seen mostly first years difference seen years6 explained detail
side effectsedit
radiation therapy painless many lowdose palliative treatments example radiation therapy bony metastases cause minimal side effects although shortterm pain flareup experienced days following treatment oedema compressing nerves treated area higher doses cause varying side effects treatment acute side effects months years following treatment longterm side effects retreatment cumulative side effects nature severity longevity side effects depends organs receive radiation treatment type radiation dose fractionation concurrent chemotherapy patient
side effects predictable expected side effects radiation usually limited area patients body treatment side effects dose dependent example higher doses head neck radiation associated cardiovascular complications thyroid dysfunction pituitary axis dysfunction7 modern radiation therapy aims reduce side effects minimum help patient understand deal side effects unavoidable
main side effects reported fatigue skin irritation like mild moderate burn fatigue often sets middle course treatment last weeks treatment ends irritated skin heal elastic before8
acute side effectsedit

techniqueedit
mechanism actionedit
radiation therapy works damaging cancerous cells damage caused types energy photon charged particle damage either direct indirect ionization atoms make chain indirect ionization happens result ionization water forming free radicals notably hydroxyl radicals damage
photon therapy radiation effect free radicals cells mechanisms repairing singlestrand damage doublestranded damage however doublestranded breaks much difficult repair lead dramatic chromosomal abnormalities genetic deletions targeting doublestranded breaks increases probability cells undergo cell death cancer cells generally less differentiated stem celllike reproduce healthy differentiated cells diminished ability repair sublethal damage singlestrand damage passed cell division damage cancer cells accumulates causing reproduce slowly
major limitations photon radiation therapy cells solid tumors become deficient oxygen solid tumors outgrow blood supply causing lowoxygen state known hypoxia oxygen potent radiosensitizer increasing effectiveness given dose radiation forming dnadamaging free radicals tumor cells hypoxic environment much times resistant radiation damage normal oxygen environment28 much research devoted overcoming hypoxia including high pressure oxygen tanks hyperthermia therapy heat therapy dilates blood vessels tumor site blood substitutes carry increased oxygen hypoxic cell radiosensitizer drugs misonidazole metronidazole hypoxic cytotoxins tissue poisons tirapazamine newer research approaches currently studied including preclinical clinical investigations oxygen diffusionenhancing compound trans sodium crocetinate radiosensitizer29

doseedit
amount radiation used photon radiation therapy measured gray varies depending type stage cancer treated curative cases typical dose solid epithelial tumor ranges lymphomas treated
preventive adjuvant doses typically around 45â€“60 18â€“2 fractions breast head neck cancers many factors considered radiation oncologists selecting dose including whether patient receiving chemotherapy patient comorbidities whether radiation therapy administered surgery degree success surgery
delivery parameters prescribed dose determined treatment planning part dosimetry treatment planning generally performed dedicated computers using specialized treatment planning software depending radiation delivery method several angles sources used total necessary dose planner design plan delivers uniform prescription dose tumor minimizes dose surrounding healthy tissues
radiation therapy threedimensional dose distributions often evaluated using dosimetry technique known dosimetry32

fractionation

section applies photon radiotherapy although types radiation therapy fractionated
total dose fractionated spread time several important reasons fractionation allows normal cells time recover tumor cells generally less efficient repair fractions fractionation also allows tumor cells relatively radioresistant phase cell cycle treatment cycle sensitive phase cycle next fraction given similarly tumor cells chronically acutely hypoxic therefore radioresistant reoxygenate fractions improving tumor cell kill33
fractionation regimens individualised different radiation therapy centers even individual doctors north america australia europe typical fractionation schedule adults five days week cancer types prolongation fraction schedule long allow tumor begin repopulating tumor types including headandneck cervical squamous cell cancers radiation treatment preferably completed within certain amount time children typical fraction size smaller fraction sizes associated reduced incidence severity lateonset side effects normal tissues
cases fractions used near course treatment schedule known concomitant boost regimen hyperfractionation used tumors regenerate quickly smaller particular tumors headandneck demonstrate behavior
patients receiving palliative radiation treat uncomplicated painful bone metastasis receive single fraction radiation34 single treatment gives comparable pain relief morbidity outcomes multiplefraction treatments patients limited life expectancy single treatment best improve patient comfort34

schedules fractionation

fractionation schedule increasingly used continues studied hypofractionation radiation treatment total dose radiation divided large doses typical doses vary significantly cancer type gyfraction gyfraction logic behind hypofractionation lessen possibility cancer returning giving cells enough time reproduce also exploit unique biological radiation sensitivity tumors35
