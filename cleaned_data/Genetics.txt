genetics study genes genetic variation heredity living organisms12 generally considered field biology intersects frequently many life sciences strongly linked study information systems
father genetics gregor mendel late 19thcentury scientist augustinian friar mendel studied trait inheritance patterns traits handed parents offspring observed organisms plants inherit traits discrete units inheritance term still used today somewhat ambiguous definition referred gene
trait inheritance molecular inheritance mechanisms genes still primary principles genetics 21st century modern genetics expanded beyond inheritance studying function behavior genes gene structure function variation distribution studied within context cell organism dominance within context population genetics given rise number subfields including epigenetics population genetics organisms studied within broad field span domain life including bacteria plants animals humans
genetic processes work combination organisms environment experiences influence development behavior often referred nature versus nurture intracellular extracellular environment cell organism switch gene transcription classic example seeds genetically identical corn placed temperate climate arid climate average height corn stalks genetically determined equal arid climate grows half height temperate climate lack water nutrients environment

punnett square depicting cross plants heterozygous purple white blossoms


fundamental level inheritance organisms occurs passing discrete heritable units called genes parents offspring36 property first observed gregor mendel studied segregation heritable traits plants1337 experiments studying trait flower color mendel observed flowers plant either purple white—but never intermediate colors different discrete versions gene called alleles
case diploid species individual plant copies gene copy inherited parent38 many species including humans pattern inheritance diploid organisms copies allele given gene called homozygous gene locus organisms different alleles given gene called heterozygous
alleles given organism called genotype observable traits organism called phenotype organisms heterozygous gene often allele called dominant qualities dominate phenotype organism allele called recessive qualities recede observed alleles complete dominance instead incomplete dominance expressing intermediate phenotype codominance expressing alleles once39
pair organisms reproduce sexually offspring randomly inherit alleles parent observations discrete inheritance segregation alleles collectively known mendels first segregation

thomas hunt morgans 1916 illustration double crossover chromosomes


diploid nature chromosomes allows genes different chromosomes assort independently separated homologous pair sexual reproduction wherein haploid gametes formed combinations genes occur offspring mating pair genes chromosome would theoretically never recombine however cellular process chromosomal crossover crossover chromosomes exchange stretches effectively shuffling gene alleles chromosomes54 process chromosomal crossover generally occurs meiosis series cell divisions creates haploid cells
first cytological demonstration crossing performed harriet creighton barbara mcclintock 1931 research experiments corn provided cytological evidence genetic theory linked genes paired chromosomes fact exchange places homolog other55
probability chromosomal crossover occurring given points chromosome related distance points arbitrarily long distance probability crossover high enough inheritance genes effectively uncorrelated56 genes closer together however lower probability crossover means genes demonstrate genetic linkage alleles genes tend inherited together amounts linkage series genes combined form linear linkage roughly describes arrangement genes along chromosome57
