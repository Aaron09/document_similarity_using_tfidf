descriptionedit
mutations involve duplication large sections usually genetic recombination8 duplications major source material evolving genes tens hundreds genes duplicated animal genomes every million years9 genes belong larger gene families shared ancestry known homology10 novel genes produced several methods commonly duplication mutation ancestral gene recombining parts different genes form combinations functions1112
protein domains modules particular independent function mixed together produce genes encoding proteins novel properties13 example human uses four genes make structures sense light three cone cell color vision cell night vision four arose single ancestral gene14 another advantage duplicating gene even entire genome increases engineering redundancy allows gene pair acquire function copy performs original function1516 types mutation occasionally create genes previously noncoding dna1718
changes chromosome number involve even larger mutations segments within chromosomes break rearrange example homininae chromosomes fused produce human chromosome fusion occur lineage apes retain separate chromosomes19 evolution important role chromosomal rearrangements accelerate divergence population species making populations less likely interbreed thereby preserving genetic differences populations20
sequences move genome transposons make major fraction genetic material plants animals important evolution genomes21 example million copies sequence present human genome sequences recruited perform functions regulating gene expression22 another effect mobile sequences move within genome mutate delete existing genes thereby produce genetic diversity5
nonlethal mutations accumulate within gene pool increase amount genetic variation23 abundance genetic changes within gene pool reduced natural selection favorable mutations accumulate result adaptive changes

main article mutationism




hugo vries making painting evening primrose plant apparently produced forms large mutations experiments thérèse schwartze 1918


mutationism several alternatives evolution natural selection existed publication charles darwins 1859 book origin species theory mutation source novelty creating forms species potentially instantaneously27 sudden jump28 envisaged driving evolution limited supply mutations
darwin biologists commonly believed saltationism possibility large evolutionary jumps including immediate speciation example 1822 étienne geoffroy sainthilaire argued species could formed sudden transformations would later called macromutation29 darwin opposed saltation insisting gradualism evolution geology 1864 albert kölliker revived geoffroys theory30 1901 geneticist hugo vries gave name mutation seemingly forms suddenly arose experiments evening primrose oenothera lamarckiana first decade 20th century mutationism vries named mutationstheorie3127 became rival darwinism supported geneticists including william bateson32 thomas hunt morgan reginald punnett3327
understanding mutationism clouded mid20th century portrayal early mutationists supporters modern synthesis opponents darwinian evolution rivals biometrics school argued selection operated continuous variation portrayal mutationism defeated synthesis genetics natural selection supposedly started later around 1918 work mathematician ronald fisher34353637 however alignment mendelian genetics natural selection began early 1902 paper udny yule38 built theoretical experimental work europe america despite controversy early mutationists 1918 already accepted natural selection explained continuous variation result multiple genes acting characteristic height3536
mutationism along alternatives darwinism like lamarckism orthogenesis discarded biologists came mendelian genetics natural selection could readily work together mutation took place source genetic variation essential natural selection work however mutationism entirely vanish 1940 richard goldschmidt argued singlestep speciation macromutation describing organisms thus produced hopeful monsters earning widespread ridicule3940 1987 masatoshi argued controversially evolution often mutationlimited41 modern biologists douglas futuyma conclude essentially claims evolution driven large mutations explained darwinian evolution42

main article mutagenesis
four classes mutations spontaneous mutations molecular decay mutations errorprone replication bypass naturally occurring damage also called errorprone translesion synthesis errors introduced repair induced mutations caused mutagens scientists also deliberately introduce mutant sequences manipulation sake scientific experimentation
2017 study claimed cancercausing mutations random environment studied population spanned countries inherited43
spontaneous mutationedit
spontaneous mutations occur nonzero probability even given healthy uncontaminated cell characterized specific change44

tautomerism base changed repositioning hydrogen atom altering hydrogen bonding pattern base resulting incorrect base pairing replication
depurination loss purine base form apurinic site site
deamination hydrolysis changes normal base atypical base containing keto group place original amine group examples include hypoxanthine corrected repair mechanisms 5mec 5methylcytosine less likely detected mutation thymine normal base
slipped strand mispairing denaturation strand template replication followed renaturation different spot slipping lead insertions deletions

errorprone replication bypassedit
increasing evidence majority spontaneously arising mutations errorprone replication translesion synthesis past damage template strand naturally occurring oxidative damages arise least 10000 times cell humans 50000 times cell rats45 mice majority mutations caused translesion synthesis46 likewise yeast kunz al47 found spontaneous single base pair substitutions deletions caused translesion synthesis
errors introduced repairedit
also damage naturally occurring repair
although naturally occurring doublestrand breaks occur relatively frequency repair often causes mutation nonhomologous joining nhej major pathway repairing doublestrand breaks nhej involves removal nucleotides allow somewhat inaccurate alignment ends rejoining followed addition nucleotides fill gaps consequence nhej often introduces mutations48

effect structureedit




five types chromosomal mutations






selection diseasecausing mutations standard table genetic code amino acids52


sequence gene altered number ways53 gene mutations varying effects health depending occur whether alter function essential proteins mutations structure genes classified several types
smallscale mutationsedit
smallscale mutations affecting gene nucleotides include

substitution mutations often caused chemicals malfunction replication exchange single nucleotide another54 changes classified transitions transversions55 common transition exchanges purine purine pyrimidine pyrimidine transition caused nitrous acid base mispairing mutagenic base analogs brdu less common transversion exchanges purine pyrimidine pyrimidine purine example transversion conversion adenine cytosine point mutation modifications single base pairs small base pairs within gene point mutation reversed another point mutation nucleotide changed back original state true reversion secondsite reversion complementary mutation elsewhere results regained gene functionality

point mutations occur within protein coding region gene classified three kinds depending upon erroneous codon codes

silent mutations code sufficiently similar amino acid
missense mutations code different amino acid
nonsense mutations code stop codon truncate protein


insertions extra nucleotides usually caused transposable elements errors replication repeating elements insertions coding region gene alter splicing mrna splice site mutation cause shift reading frame frameshift significantly alter gene product insertions reversed excision transposable element
point deletions remove nucleotides like insertions mutations alter reading frame gene general irreversible though exactly sequence might theory restored insertion transposable elements able revert short deletion bases location either highly unlikely exist exist

largescale mutationsedit
largescale mutations chromosomal structure include

amplifications gene duplications leading multiple copies chromosomal regions increasing dosage genes located within
deletions large chromosomal regions leading loss genes within regions
mutations whose effect juxtapose previously separate pieces potentially bringing together separate genes form functionally distinct fusion genes bcrabl include

chromosomal translocations interchange genetic parts nonhomologous chromosomes
interstitial deletions intrachromosomal deletion removes segment single chromosome thereby apposing previously distant genes example cells isolated human astrocytoma type brain tumor found chromosomal deletion removing sequences fused glioblastoma gene receptor tyrosine kinase producing fusion protein figros abnormal figros fusion protein constitutively active kinase activity causes oncogenic transformation transformation normal cells cancer cells
chromosomal inversions reversing orientation chromosomal segment

hypomorph mullarian classification altered gene product acts decreased gene expression compared wild type allele
neomorph characterized control protein product synthesis
lethal mutations mutations lead death organisms carry mutations
back mutation reversion point mutation restores original sequence hence original phenotype63
