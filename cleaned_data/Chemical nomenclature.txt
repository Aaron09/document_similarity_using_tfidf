aims chemical nomenclatureedit
primary function chemical nomenclature ensure spoken written chemical name leaves ambiguity concerning chemical compound name refers chemical name refer single substance less important ensure substance single name although limited number alternative names acceptable cases
preferably name also conveys information structure chemistry compound numbers form extreme example names perform function number refers single compound none contain information structure
form nomenclature used depends audience addressed single correct form exists rather different forms less appropriate different circumstances
common name often suffice identify chemical compound particular circumstances generally applicable name indicate least chemical formula specific still threedimensional arrangement atoms need specified
specific circumstances construction large indices becomes necessary ensure compound unique name requires addition extra rules standard iupac system system commonly used context expense names longer less familiar readers another system gaining popularity international chemical identifier inchi reflects substances structure composition making general number
iupac system often criticized failures become relevant example differing reactivity sulfur allotropes iupac distinguish iupac humanreadable advantage numbering would difficult claim iupac names larger relevant molecules rapamycin humanreadable researchers simply informal names
differing aims chemical nomenclature lexicographyedit
generally understood aims lexicography versus chemical nomenclature vary extent odds dictionaries words whether traditional print collect report meanings words uses appear change time dictionaries limited formal editorial process definitions—in case definitions chemical names terms—can change rapidly without concern formal historical meanings chemical nomenclature hand iupac nomenclature best example necessarily restrictive aims standardize communication practice chemical term used fixed meaning relating chemical structure thereby giving insights chemical properties derived molecular functions differing aims profound effects valid understanding chemistry especially regard chemical classes achieved mass attention examples impact seen considering examples

resveratrol single compound clearly defined common name confused popularly cisisomer
omega3 fatty acids reasonably welldefined chemical structure class nevertheless broad result formal definition
polyphenols fairly broad structural class formal definition mistranslations general misuse term relative formal definition serious usage errors ambiguity relationship structure activity

rapid pace meanings change particular chemical compounds perceived health benefits rightly wrongly ascribed complicates matter maintaining sound nomenclature access understanding discussion specific examples appears article polyphenols differing definitions various definitions common uses word odds accepted chemical nomenclature connecting polyphenol structure bioactivity

compositional nomenclatureedit
typei ionic binary compoundsedit
typei ionic binary compounds cation metal cases named first anion usually nonmetal named second cation retains elemental name iron zinc suffix nonmetal changes example compound libr made cations anions thus called lithium bromide compound composed cations anions referred barium oxide
oxidation state element unambiguous ions combine typei binary compound equalbutopposite charges neutralized compounds charge zero
typeii ionic binary compoundsedit
typeii ionic binary compounds cation oxidation state common among transition metals name compounds must determine charge cation write name would done type ionic compounds except roman numeral indicating charge cation written parentheses next cation name sometimes referred stock nomenclature example take compound fecl3 cation iron occur order compound charge zero cation must three anions balanced balance thus compound called ironiii chloride another example could compound pbs2 anion subscript formula giving charge compound must balanced charge cation lead transition metal form cations charge thus compound made cation every anions compound balanced name written leadiv sulfide
older system relying latin names elements also sometimes used name type ionic binary compounds system metal instead roman numeral next suffix added indicate oxidation state lower higher example compound contains cation balances anion since oxidation state lower possibility compound sometimes called ferrous oxide compound sno2 balancing charge anions higher oxidation state alternative compound called stannic oxide
ionic compounds contain polyatomic ions charged entities containing covalently bonded types atoms important know names common polyatomic ions include

ammonium

nitrite

nitrate

sulfite so2−

sulfate so2−

hydrogen sulfate bisulfate hso−

hydroxide
cyanide
phosphate po3−

hydrogen phosphate hpo2−

dihydrogen phosphate
2po−

carbonate co2−

hydrogen carbonate bicarbonate hco−

hypochlorite clo−
chlorite clo−

chlorate clo−

perchlorate clo−

acetate



permanganate mno−

dichromate
2o2−

chromate cro2−

peroxide

superoxide

oxalate
2o2−

hydrogenoxalate



formula na2so3 denotes cation sodium anion sulfite so2−
therefore compound named sodium sulfite given formula caoh2 seen hydroxide since charge calcium makes sense must ions balance charge therefore name compound calcium hydroxide asked write formula copperi chromate roman numeral indicates copper identify compound contains chromate cro2−
copper ions needed balance charge chromate formula cu2cro4
typeiii binary compoundsedit
typeiii binary compounds covalently bonded covalent bonding occurs nonmetal elements covalentlybonded compounds also known molecules compound first element named first full elemental name second element named anion root name element suffix prefixes used indicate numbers atom present prefixes mono three tetra four penta five hexa hepta seven octa eight nona nine deca prefix mono never used first element thus ncl3 called nitrogen trichloride p2o5 called diphosphorus pentoxide penta prefix dropped vowel easier pronunciation called boron trifluoride
carbon dioxide written sulfur tetrafluoride written compounds however common names prevail example usually called water rather dihydrogen monoxide preferentially called ammonia rather hydrogen nitride
substitutive nomenclatureedit
naming method generally follows established iupac organic nomenclature hydrides main group elements groups 13–17 given base name borane oxidane phosphane although name phosphine also common recommended iupac compound pcl3 would thus named substitutively trichlorophosphane chlorine substituting however names stems derived element name example called azane
additive nomenclatureedit
naming method developed principally coordination compounds although widely applied example application coclnh35cl2 pentaamminechloridocobaltiii chloride
ligands special naming convention whereas chloride becomes prefix chloro substitutive naming ligand becomes chlorido
