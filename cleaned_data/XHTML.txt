overviewedit
xhtml reformulation three html document types applications world wide consortium also continues maintain html recommendation specifications html5 xhtml5 actively developed current xhtml recommendation document published revised august 2002 commented xhtml family next step evolution internet migrating xhtml today content developers enter world attendant benefits still remaining confident contents backward future compatibility4
however 2005 hypertext application technology working group whatwg formed independently work advancing ordinary html based xhtml whatwg eventually began working standard supported nonxml serializations html5 parallel standards xhtml 2007 w3cs html working group voted officially recognize html5 work nextgeneration html standard5 2009 allowed xhtml working groups charter expire acknowledging html5 would sole nextgeneration html standard including nonxml serializations6 serializations suggests authors html syntax rather xhtml syntax7
motivationedit
xhtml developed make html extensible increase interoperability data formats8 addition browsers forgiving errors html websites displayed despite technical errors markup xhtml introduced stricter error handling9 html ostensibly application standard generalized markup language sgml however specification sgml complex neither browsers html recommendation fully conformant it10 standard approved 1998 provided simpler data format closer simplicity html shifting format hoped html would become compatible common tools12 servers proxies would able transform content necessary constrained devices mobile phones13 using namespaces xhtml documents could provide extensibility including fragments xmlbased languages scalable vector graphics mathml14 finally renewed work would provide opportunity divide html reusable components xhtml modularization clean untidy parts language15
relationship htmledit
various differences xhtml html document object model tree structure represents page internally applications xhtml html different ways representing markup serializations less expressive example placed comments cannot represented comment either xhtml html generally xhtmls syntax little expressive html example arbitrary namespaces allowed html first source differences immediate xhtml uses syntax html uses pseudosgml syntax officially sgml html never practice standardised away sgml html5 secondly however expressible contents syntax slightly different changes actual behavior models
first differences syntax16

broadly rules require elements closed either separate closing using selfclosing syntax html syntax permits elements unclosed either always empty input determined implicitly omissibility
casesensitive element attribute names html
shorthand features html omitted attribute minimization attribute values quotes omitted option selected option selectedselected must expressed option selectedselected element minimization used remove elements entirely tbody inferred table given rarely used sgml syntax element minimization shorttag browsers implement17
numerous technical requirements surrounding namespaces precise parsing whitespace certain characters elements exact parsing html practice undefined recently html5 specification html5 full details working summary html xhtml

second contrast minor syntactical differences behavioral differences mostly arising underlying differences serialization example

prominently behavior parse errors differ fatal parse error incorrect structure causes document processing aborted
content requiring namespaces work html except builtin support mathml html5 parser along certain magic prefixes xlink
javascript processing little different xhtml minor changes case sensitivity functions precautions restrict processing wellformed content scripts must documentwrite method available xhtml innerhtml property available insert nonwellformed content hand used insert wellformed namespaced content xhtml
cascading style sheets also applied slightly differently xhtmls casesensitivity selectors become casesensitive xhtml documents18 properties backgrounds body element html inherited upwards html element appears case xhtml19

adoptionedit
similarities html xhtml many sites content management systems adopt initial xhtml recommendation authors transition provided guidance publish xhtml documents htmlcompatible manner serve browsers designed xhtml2021
htmlcompatible content sent using html media type texthtml rather official internet media type xhtml applicationxhtmlxml measuring adoption xhtml regular html therefore important distinguish whether media type usage actual document contents compared2223
browsers mature support24 possible xhtml media types25 notable exception internet explorer versions earlier microsoft rather rendering applicationxhtmlxml content dialog invites user save content disk instead internet explorer released 2006 internet explorer released march 2009 exhibit behavior26 microsoft developer chris wilson explained 2005 ie7’s priorities improved browser security support proper xhtml support would difficult graft onto ie’s compatibilityoriented html parser27 however microsoft added support true xhtml ie928
long support widespread developers avoid using xhtml htmlcompatible29 advantages namespaces faster parsing smallerfootprint browsers benefit user303132
criticismedit
early 2000s developers began question authors ever made leap authoring xhtml333435 others countered problems ascribed xhtml could mostly attributed main sources production invalid xhtml documents authors lack support xhtml built internet explorer 63637 went describe benefits xmlbased documents xhtml regarding searching indexing parsing well futureproofing
october 2006 html inventor chair bernerslee introducing major effort develop html specification posted blog attempt world switch didnt work large htmlgenerating public move large communities shift enjoying fruits wellformed systems plan charter completely html group38 current html5 working draft says special attention given defining clear conformance criteria user agents effort improve interoperability time updating html specifications address issues raised past years hickson editor html5 specification criticising improper xhtml 200233 member group developing specification listed coeditors current working draft39
simon pieters researched xmlcompliance mobile browsers40 concluded “the claim xhtml would needed mobile devices simply myth”

xhtml transitional equivalent html transitional includes presentational elements center font strike excluded strict version
xhtml frameset equivalent html frameset allows definition frameset documents—a common feature late 1990s

second edition xhtml became recommendation august 200242
modularization xhtmledit
modularization provides abstract collection components xhtml subsetted extended feature intended help xhtml extend reach onto emerging platforms mobile devices webenabled televisions initial draft modularization xhtml became available april 1999 reached recommendation status april 200143
first modular xhtml variants xhtml xhtml basic
october 2008 modularization xhtml superseded xhtml modularization adds schema implementation superseded second edition july 201044
xhtml modulebased xhtmledit
xhtml evolved work surrounding initial modularization xhtml specification released first draft september 1999 recommendation status reached 200145 modules combined within xhtml effectively recreate xhtml strict addition ruby annotation elements ruby better support eastasian languages changes include removal name attribute elements first edition language removal lang attribute favour xmllang
although xhtml largely compatible xhtml html august 2002 working group issued formal note advising transmitted html media type46 limited browser support alternate applicationxhtmlxml media type xhtml proved unable gain widespread january 2009 second edition document xhtml media types second edition issued relaxing restriction allowing xhtml served texthtml47
second edition xhtml issued november 2010 addresses various errata adds schema implementation included original specification48 first released briefly 2009 proposed edited recommendation49 rescinded unresolved issues
xhtml basicedit
main article xhtml basic
since information appliances lack system resources implement xhtml abstract modules defined featurelimited xhtml specification called xhtml basic provides minimal feature subset sufficient common contentauthoring specification became recommendation december 200050

features introduced xhtml included

html forms replaced xforms xmlbased user input specification allowing forms displayed appropriately different rendering devices
html frames replaced xframes
events replaced events uses document object model
list element type element type included specifically designate list navigation list would useful creating nested menus currently created wide variety means like nested unordered lists nested definition lists
element able hyperlink hrefarticleshtmlarticlesli similar xlink however xlink compatible xhtml design differences
element able reference alternative media attribute srclbridgejpg typeimagejpeglondon bridgep object srclbridgejpg typeimagejpegplondon bridgepobject
attribute element removed alternative text given content element much like object element srchmsaudaciousjpghms span classitalicaudaciousspanimg
single heading element added level headings determined depth nesting would allowed headings infinite rather limiting levels deep
remaining presentational elements still allowed xhtml even strict absent xhtml somewhat presentational elements remaining superscript subscript respectively significant nonpresentational uses required certain languages tags meant semantic instead strong strong emphasis allowing user agent control presentation elements rendered boldface text visual browsers possibly rendered changes tone texttospeech reader larger italic font rules userend stylesheet
addition triple property attributes facilitate conversion xhtml rdfxml

xhtml5edit
