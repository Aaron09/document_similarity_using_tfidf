refraction light interface media different refractive indices since phase velocity lower second medium angle refraction less angle incidence higherindex medium closer normal


optics refraction phenomenon often occurs waves travel medium given refractive index medium another oblique angle boundary media waves phase velocity altered usually causing change direction wavelength increases decreases frequency remains constantcitation needed example light refract enters leaves glass change refractive index traveling along normal perpendicular boundary suffer change speed direction refraction still occurs case snells angle incidence understanding concept invention lenses refracting telescope

refraction allows phenomena rainbows also produce peculiar optical phenomena mirages fata morgana caused change refractive index temperature
refractive index materials also nonlinear occurs kerr effect high intensity light leads refractive index proportional intensity incident light
recently metamaterials created negative refractive index metamaterials also obtain total refraction phenomena wave impedances media matched reflected wave4
also since refraction make objects appear closer responsible allowing water magnify objects first light entering drop water slows waters surface flat light bent path round shape bend light outwards spreads image gets larger
