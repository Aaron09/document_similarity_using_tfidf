madison believed british economic policies designed foster imperial preference harming american economy british north america existed conduit american strugglers undercutting trade policies thus required united states annex british north america55 furthermore madison believed great lakesst lawrence trade route might become main trade route export north american goods europe expense economy united states controlled resources british north america like timber british needed navy britain would forced change maritime policies offended american public opinion55 many americans believed natural country swallow north america congressman john harper saying speech author nature marked limits south gulf mexico north regions eternal frost55 upper canada modern southern ontario settled mostly revolutionera exiles united states united empire loyalists postwar american immigrants loyalists hostile union united states immigrant settlers generally uninterested politics remained neutral supported british canadian colonies thinly populated lightly defended british army americans believed many upper canada would rise greet american invading army liberators happen reason american forces retreated successful battle inside canada could obtain supplies locals56 americans thought possibility local support suggested easy conquest former president thomas jefferson believed acquisition canada year neighborhood quebec mere matter marching give experience attack halifax next final expulsion england american continent57
annexation supported american border businessmen wanted gain control great lakes trade58
carl benn noted hawks desire annex canadas similar enthusiasm annexation spanish florida inhabitants american south expected facilitate expansion longdesired lands support hostile indian tribes tecumsehs confederacy north creek south59
tennessee congressman felix grundy considered essential acquire canada preserve domestic political balance arguing annexing canada would maintain free stateslave state balance might otherwise thrown acquisition florida settlement southern areas louisiana purchase60
historian richard maass argued 2015 expansionist theme myth goes relative consensus among experts primary objective repeal british maritime restrictions argues consensus among scholars united states went years economic sanctions failed bring britain negotiating table threatening royal navys canadian supply base last hope maass agrees theoretically expansionism might tempted americans finds leaders feared domestic political consequences notably limited expansionism focused sparsely populated western lands rather populous eastern settlements canada nevertheless maas notes many historians continue believe expansionism cause
horsman argued expansionism played role secondary cause maritime issues noting many historians mistakenly rejected expansionism cause notes considered maintaining sectional balance free slave states thrown american settlement louisiana territory widely supported dozens hawk congressmen john harper felix grundy henry clay richard johnson voted expansion

disagreeing interpretations simply stressed expansionism minimized maritime causation historians ignored deepseated american fears national security dreams continent completely controlled republican united states evidence many americans believed 1812 would occasion united states achieve longdesired annexation canada thomas jefferson wellsummarized american majority opinion cession canada must sine treaty peace62

however horsman states view desire canada cause 1812 united states declare wanted obtain canada acquisition canada viewed major collateral benefit conflict62
historian alan taylor says many democraticrepublican congressmen richard johnson john harper peter porter longed oust british continent annex canada southerners opposed fearing imbalance free slave states canada annexed anticatholicism also caused many oppose annexing mainly catholic lower canada believing frenchspeaking inhabitants unfit republican citizenship even major figures henry clay james monroe expected keep least upper canada event easy conquest notable american generals like william hull sentiment issue proclamations canadians promising republican liberation incorporation united states proclamation government never officially disavowed general alexander smyth similarly declared troops invaded canada enter country become united states arrive among people become fellowcitizens lack clarity american intentions undercut appeals however63
david jeanne heidler argue historians agree 1812 caused expansionism instead reflected real concern american patriots defend united states neutral rights overbearing tyranny british navy expansionist aims would potentially result war64
however also argue otherwise saying acquiring canada would satisfy americas expansionist desires also describing goal western expansionists argue believed eliminating british presence canada would best accomplish goal halting british support indian raids argue enduring debate relative importance expansionism factor whether expansionism played greater role causing 1812 american concern protecting neutral maritime rights65
