withdrawal proposaledit
south african president jacob zuma said perceptions unreasonable calling special summit october 2015 botswana notable supporter africa237 summit endorse proposal mass withdrawal lack support idea238 however summit conclude serving heads state trial kenyan cases deferred ethiopian foreign minister tedros adhanom said rejected double standard applying dispensing international justice239 despite calls went ahead requiring william ruto attend trial240 unsc asked consider deferring trials kenyatta ruto year241 rejected242 november iccs assembly state parties responded kenyas calls exemption sitting heads state243 agreeing consider amendments rome statute address concerns244

checks balancesedit
united states department state argues insufficient checks balances authority prosecutor judges insufficient protection politicized prosecutions abuses45 current united states american servicemembers protection stat nicknamed hague invasion invade hague forbids united states cooperating cases involve nationals

limitations exist human rights watch reported iccs prosecutor team takes account roles played government conflict uganda rwanda congo flawed investigation reach conclusion verdict considering governments’ position actions conflict251
unintentional consequencesedit
research suggests prosecutions leaders makes dictators less likely peacefully step down252 also argued justice means peace result used means intervention ongoing conflicts expectation indictments arrests trials elite perpetrators deterrence preventive effects atrocity crimes despite legitimate intentions great expectations little evidence efficacy justice means peace253
state cooperationedit
cannot mount successful cases without state cooperation problematic several reasons means acts inconsistently selection cases prevented taking hard cases loses legitimacy254 also gives less deterrent value potential perpetrators crimes know avoid judgment taking government refusing cooperate254
questioning true application principle complementarityedit
fundamental principle complementarity rome statute often taken granted legal analysis international criminal jurisprudence initially thorny issue actual application complementarity principle arose 2008 william schabas published monumental paper255 however despite schabas theoretical impact substantive research made scholars issue quite time june 2017 victor tsilonis advanced criticism reinforced events practices office prosecutor cases essays honour nestor courakis paper essentially argues αl‐senussi case arguably first instance complementarity principles actual implementation eleven whole years ratification rome statute international criminal court256
