natural resource conservationedit
conscious efforts conserve protect global biodiversity recent phenomenon718 natural resource conservation however history extends prior conservation resource ethics grew necessity direct relations nature regulation communal restraint became necessary prevent selfish motives taking could locally sustained therefore compromising longterm supply rest community7 social dilemma respect natural resource management often called tragedy commons1920
principle conservation biologists trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures solution communal resource conflict7 example alaskan tlingit peoples haida pacific northwest resource boundaries rules restrictions among clans respect fishing sockeye salmon rules guided clan elders knew lifelong details river stream managed721 numerous examples history cultures followed rules rituals organized practice respect communal natural resource management2223
mauryan emperor ashoka around issued edicts restricting slaughter animals certain kinds birds well opened veterinary clinics
conservation ethics also found early religious philosophical writings examples shinto hindu islamic buddhist traditions724 greek philosophy plato lamented pasture land degradation left skeleton body wasted disease rich soft soil carried bare framework district left25 bible moses commanded land rest cultivation every seventh year726 18th century however much european culture considered pagan view admire nature wilderness denigrated agricultural development praised27 however early wildlife sanctuary founded farne islands cuthbert response religious beliefs7

mid20th century efforts arose target individual species conservation notably efforts conservation south america york zoological society50 early 20th century york zoological society instrumental developing concepts establishing preserves particular species conducting necessary conservation studies determine suitability locations appropriate conservation priorities work henry fairfield osborn carl akeley archie carr archie carr notable era5152citation needed akeley example expeditions virunga mountains observed mountain gorilla wild became convinced species area conservation priorities instrumental persuading albert belgium defense mountain gorilla establish albert national park since renamed virunga national park democratic republic congo53
1970s primarily work united states endangered species act54 along species risk sara canada biodiversity action plans developed australia sweden united kingdom hundreds species specific protection plans ensued notably united nations acted conserve sites outstanding cultural natural importance common heritage mankind programme adopted general conference unesco 1972 2006 total sites listed cultural natural first country pursue aggressive biological conservation national legislation united states passed back back legislation endangered species act55 1966 national environmental policy 197056 together injected major funding protection measures largescale habitat protection threatened species research conservation developments however taken hold throughout world india example passed wildlife protection 197257
1980 significant development emergence urban conservation movement local organization established birmingham development followed rapid succession cities across overseas although perceived grassroots movement early development driven academic research urban wildlife initially perceived radical movements view conservation inextricably linked human activity become mainstream conservation thought considerable research effort directed urban conservation biology society conservation biology originated 198572
1992 countries world become committed principles conservation biological diversity convention biological diversity58 subsequently many countries began programmes biodiversity action plans identify conserve threatened species within borders well protect associated habitats late 1990s increasing professionalism sector maturing organisations institute ecology environmental management society environment
since 2000 concept landscape scale conservation risen prominence less emphasis given singlespecies even singlehabitat focused actions instead ecosystem approach advocated mainstream conservationists although concerns expressed working protect highprofile species
ecology clarified workings biosphere complex interrelationships among humans species physical environment burgeoning human population associated agriculture industry ensuing pollution demonstrated easily ecological relationships disrupted59
