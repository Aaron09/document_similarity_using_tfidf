pounds measure cannon boreedit
smoothbore cannon carronade bores designated weight imperial pounds spherical solid iron shot diameter bore standard sizes pounds 68pound weapons nonstandard weapons using scheme carronadeordnance
middle 17th century middle 19th century measurement bore large gunpowder weapons usually expressed weight iron shot pounds iron shot used standard reference iron common material used artillery ammunition period solid spherical shot common form encountered artillery classified thereby standard categories 3pounders 4pdr 6pdr 8pdr 9pdr 12pdr 18pdr 24pdr 32pdr common sizes encountered although larger smaller intermediate sizes existed
practice though significant variation occurred actual mass projectile given nominal shot weight country manufacture significant consideration determining bore diameters example french livre 1812 mass 4895 whilst contemporary english avoirdupois pound massed approximately thus french 32pdr battle trafalgar threw shot 1138 mass english 32pdr
