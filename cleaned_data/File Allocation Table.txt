usesedit
file system long history three decades usage desktops portable computers frequently used embedded solutions
offers reasonably good performance robustness even lightweight implementations3 therefore widely adopted supported virtually existing operating systems personal computers well home computers multitude embedded systems also makes useful format solidstate memory cards convenient share data operating systems
file systems default file system removable media exception dvds commonly found floppy disks superfloppies memory flash memory cards flash drives supported portable devices pdas digital cameras camcorders media players mobile phones fat12 omnipresent floppy disks fat16 fat32 typically found larger media
also commonly used hard disks throughout windows eras hard drives declined since introduction windows primarily uses newer ntfs still used hard drives expected used multiple operating systems shared windows gnulinux environments
widespread fatformatted media many operating systems provide support official thirdparty file system handlers example gnulinux freebsd beos provide builtin support even though also support sophisticated file systems ext4 btrfs macos support file systems volumes boot disk amigaos supports crossdos package
many purposes ntfs file system superior terms features reliability main drawbacks complexity size overhead small volumes well limited support anything ntbased versions windows since exact specification trade secret microsoft availability ntfs3g since mid2006 much improved ntfs support unixlike operating systems considerably alleviating concern still possible ntfs doslike operating systems without thirdparty drivers turn makes difficult floppy recovery purposes microsoft provided recovery console work around issue security reasons severely limited could done recovery console default movement recovery utilities boot based bartpe linux ntfs3g winpe eroding drawback complexity ntfs prevents implementation lightweight operating systems embedded systems
file system adopted almost digital cameras since 1998 defines logical file system filenames makes either fat12 fat16 fat32 exfat mandatory physical layer order maximize platform interoperability6
also used internally system partition partition type 0xef boot stage eficompliant computers7
hidden filesystems also used uefi boot partition modern uefi specification requires compliant firmware capable reading fat12 fat16 fat32 compliant partitions
floppy disks standardized ecma1078 isoiec 929319949 superseding 9293198710 standards cover fat12 fat16 short filename support long filenames vfat partially patented11
nomenclatureedit
technically term file system refers three major variants file system fat12 fat16 fat32 parties clearly distinguish necessary contrast microsoft typically longer distinguishes three since introduction fat32 refers fat12 fat16 whereas fat32 gets treated specially dialog boxes documentation sometimes lead confusion actual type file system used mentioned cannot explicitly specified want format fat32 instead want format fat12 fat16 fat32
another common cause confusion exists within group fat16 file systems since term fat16 refers either whole group file systems 16bit wide cluster entries specifically original implementation 16bit sector entries becomes necessary differentiate original later implementation technically newer variant 32bit sector entries called fat16b commonly referred name fat16 well particular since original variant rarely seen today typically used small media backward compatibility required
term vfat various misconceptions wellnb sometimes erroneously used would describe another variant file system distinguished fat12 fat16 fat32 file systems reality specify another file system optional extension work file system fat12 fat16 fat32 volumes utilizing vfat longfilenames read also operating systems supporting vfat extension long operating systems support underlying file system fat12 fat16 fat32
another cause misconceptions stems apparent redundancy possible ambiguity definition volumes general type file system fat12 fat16 fat32 determined width cluster entries specific threshold values amount clusters7 stored defined determine type used even though properties size volume count sectors format file system name ebpb case partitioned media used partition often seem wellsuited distinguishing criteria well cannot reliably used derive file system type scenarios7 whilst uncommon technically possible define fat12 fat16 volume using fat32 ebpb sort misnomer ebpb variant introduced normally used fat32 volumes onlynb also partition sometimes indicate special properties hidden secure access operating system often used conjunction particular file system variants typically used specify type file system rather keep older foreign operating systems aware partition accessing partitions cannot handle work with12 therefore necessary distinguish generic file system types fat12 fat16 fat32 partition types fat12 fat16 fat16b fat16x fat32 fat32x

august 1984 released featured hard disk 302728 microsoft introduced msdos parallel cluster addresses increased 16bit allowing 65524 clusters volume consequently much greater file system sizes least theory however maximum possible number sectors maximum partition rather disk size change therefore although cluster addresses bits format today commonly understood fat16 partition type 0x04 indicates form fat16 less 65536 sectors less sector size
initial implementation fat16 actually providing larger partition sizes fat12 early benefit fat16 enable smaller clusters making disk usage efficient particularly large numbers files hundred bytes size
msdos hard disks larger incompatible later versions msdos29 hard disk formatted msdos accessible older msdos msdos support version fat16 msdos could still access msdos 20style cluster partitions
logical sectored fatedit
hard disks grew larger fat12 fat16 file system implementation msdos provide means take advantage extra storage several manufacturers developed variants address problem msdos issues30
vendors nec30 supported eight instead standard four primary partition entries custom extended master boot record adapted msdos single primary partition
vendors worked around volume size limits imposed 16bit sector entries arithmetics increasing size sectors file system dealt thereby blowing dimensions
socalled logical sectors larger 8192 bytes physical sector size still typically bytes expected rombios disk drive hardware dosbios system bios would combine multiple physical sectors logical sectors file system work changes transparent file system implementation kernel since file systems abstraction level volumes seen linear series logically addressable sectors also known absolute sectors addressed logical sector number starting independent physical location volume physical medium geometry underlying dosbios translated logical sectors physical sectors according partitioning information drives physical geometry
drawback approach less memoryefficient sector buffering deblocking dosbios thereby causing increased memory footprint data structures since older versions flexible enough work logical geometries oems introduce partition variants order hide offtheshelf issues msdos known partition logical sectored fats include 0x08 commodore msdos 0x11 leading edge msdos 0x14 msdos 0x24 msdos 33030 0x56 msdos 0xe5 tandy msdos 0xf2 sperry msdos unisys msdos also used digital research plus 2131 versions like toshiba msdos wyse msdos 3332 well zenith msdos also known utilized logical sectoring33
