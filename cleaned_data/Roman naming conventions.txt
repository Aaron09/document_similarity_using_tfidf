cognomina known beginning republic long regarded informal names omitted official records second century later inscriptions commemorating early centuries republic supply missing surnames although authenticity disputed empire however cognomen acquired great importance number cognomina assumed roman aristocracy multiplied exponentially1
adding complexity aristocratic names practice combining full nomenclature ones paternal maternal ancestors resulting individuals appearing complete names duplicative politically undesirable names might omitted order names might rearranged emphasize giving bearer greatest prestige2
following promulgation constitutio antoniniana granting roman citizenship free living within roman empire praenomen nomen lost much distinguishing function newly enfranchised citizens shared name marcus aurelius praenomen sometimes nomen gradually disappeared view crowded names indicating bearers rank social connections surviving inscriptions fifth century rarely provide citizens full nomenclature12

cognomen third element tria nomina began additional personal name unique rome rome cognomen flourished development gens gradual decline praenomen useful means distinguishing individuals made cognomen useful means identifying individuals whole branches romes leading families early years republic aristocratic romans many three cognomina hereditary others personal1
like nomen cognomina could arise number factors personal characteristics habits occupations places origin heroic exploits forth class cognomina consisted largely archaic praenomina seldom used later republic although cognomina names persisted throughout imperial times11 many cognomina unusual terminations latin names ending meanings frequently obscure even antiquity seems emphasize manner many cognomina originally arose nicknames termination typical latin nomina generally used cognomina fourth century making easier distinguish nomina cognomina final centuries western empire2
unlike nomen passed unchanged father cognomina could appear disappear almost normally chosen persons bore earned bestowed others account wide variety unflattering names used cognomina doubtless cognomina used ironically others continued largely whatever origin useful distinguishing among individuals branches large families cognomina coined came fashion throughout roman history1
empire number cognomina increased dramatically noble patrician houses used multiple surnames romans backgrounds social standing might bear several cognomina third century become norm amongst freeborn roman citizens question classify different cognomina grammarians fourth fifth centuries designate agnomina4
republic usual manner distinguishing individuals binomial form praenomen nomen praenomen lost value distinguishing name gradually faded obscurity former role assumed versatile cognomen typical manner identifying individuals came nomen cognomen essentially form binomial nomenclature replaced another course several centuries lack regularity allowed cognomen used either personal hereditary surname became strength imperial times hereditary surname cognomen could used identify individuals connection noble families either descent later association individual cognomina could also used distinguish members family even siblings came share praenomen bore different cognomina paternal line others maternal ancestors2
although nomen required element roman nomenclature western empire usefulness distinguishing name declined throughout imperial times increasingly large portion population bore nomina flavius aurelius granted masse newly enfranchised citizens result third century cognomen became important element roman name frequently useful distinguishing individuals later empire proliferation cognomina full nomenclature individuals recorded many cases names surviving extant records cognomina2

adoptive cognominaedit
main article adoption ancient rome
adoption common formal process roman culture chief purpose nothing providing homes children ensuring continuity family lines might otherwise become extinct early rome especially important patricians enjoyed tremendous status privilege compared plebeians families admitted patriciate expulsion kings number plebeians continually grew patricians continually struggled preserve wealth influence sons inherit property preserve family name would adopt younger sons another family time plebeians also acquired wealth gained access offices roman state came participate roman system adoption1213
since primary purpose adoption preserve name status adopter adopted would usually assume praenomen nomen adoptive father together hereditary cognomina eldest would done however adoption result complete abandonment adopted sons birth name sons original nomen occasionally cognomen would become basis surname formed adding derivative suffix anus inus stem thus lucius aemilius paullus adopted publius cornelius scipio became publius cornelius scipio aemilianus dictator gaius julius caesar adopted grandnephew gaius octavius became known gaius julius caesar octavianus1412
filiationedit
apart praenomen filiation oldest element roman name even development nomen hereditary surname customary name persons father means distinguishing others personal name thus lucius marcus would lucius marci filius paulla daughter quintus would paulla quinti filia many nomina derived praenomina least corresponding nomen lucilius marcius publilius quinctius servilius known patronymic surnames derived name original bearers father even development nomen cognomen filiation remained useful means distinguishing members large family4

filiations normally written nomen cognomina abbreviated using typical abbreviations praenomina followed filius filia sometimes nepos grandson neptis granddaughter thus inscription postumius albus regillensis means spurius postumius albus regillensis aulus publius grandson tiberius aemilius mamercinus lucius grandson mamercus would written aemilius mamercinus formal writing generations might included greatgrandchild would pron pronep pronepos proneptis greatgreatgrandchild abnep abnepos abneptis greatgreatgreatgrandchild adnepos adneptisxi however forms rarely included part name except grandest monumental inscriptions14
filiation sometimes included name mother case gnatusxii would follow mothers name instead filius filiaxiii especially common families etruscan origin names married women sometimes followed husbands name uxor wife fabius furia gnatus maximus means numerius fabius maximus quintus grandson marcus born furiaxiv claudia valeri uxor would claudia wife lucius valerius
slaves freedmen also possessed filiations although case person referred usually slaves owner rather father abbreviations include servus serva libertus liberta slave might owner case names could given serially cases owners nomen cognomen used instead addition praenomen liberti women sometimes used inverted signifying feminine praenomen gaia used generically mean woman examples inverted although clear whether used generically specifically feminine praenomen marca marcia11
example filiation slaves freedmen would alexander corneli alexander slave lucius cornelius upon emancipation would probably become cornelius alexander lucius cornelius alexander freedman lucius customary freedman take praenomen former owner already original personal name cognomen another example might salvia pompeia salvia pompeia freedwoman gnaeus pompeius gaia gaia used generically irrespective whether pompeius wife actually named gaia freedman emperor might filiation augusti libertus

tribeedit
main article roman tribe
beginning roman republic citizens enumerated tribes making comitia tributa tribal assembly democratic romes three main legislative assemblies roman republic citizens could participate equal basis without regard wealth social status time decrees known plebi scita plebiscites became binding whole roman people although much assemblys authority usurped emperors membership tribe remained important part roman citizenship name tribe came incorporated citizens full nomenclature151617
number tribes varied time tradition ascribed institution thirty tribes servius tullius sixth king rome destroyed beginning republic several tribes added large swaths italy came roman control bringing total number tribes thirtyfive except brief experiment social number remained fixed nature tribes mainly geographic rather ethnic inhabitants rome theory assigned four urban tribes territory beyond city allocated rural rustic tribes1516
geography sole determining factor ones tribus times efforts made assign freedmen four urban tribes thus concentrating votes limiting influence comitia tributa perhaps similar reasons large numbers provincials gained franchise certain rural tribes preferred enrollment citizens normally change tribes moved region another censors power punish citizen expelling rural tribes assigning urban tribes later periods citizens enrolled tribes without respect geography16
precisely became common include name citizens tribus part full nomenclature uncertain name tribe normally follows filiation precedes cognomina suggesting occurred cognomen recognized formal part roman name probably later second century however writing inscriptions tribus found much less frequency parts name custom including seem deeply ingrained roman practice filiation common abbreviate name tribe names thirtyfive tribes abbreviations roman tribe15

earliest period binomial nomenclature praenomen nomen developed throughout italy shared women1 praenomina masculine feminine forms number praenomina common women seldom never used mens praenomina womens names regularly abbreviated instead written full18 list womens praenomina found praenomen
variety reasons womens praenomina became neglected course roman history republic women praenomina disappear entirely roman women bereft personal names roman history women known chiefly nomina cognomina1
first reasons probably praenomen lost much original utility following adoption hereditary surnames number praenomina commonly used women declined throughout roman history might hold public office serve military praenomen remained important part legal name ancient societies roman women played little role public life factors resulted continuation mens praenomina exist women
another factor probably praenomen usually necessary distinguish women within family roman woman change nomen married nomen alone usually sufficient distinguish every member family latin names distinctive masculine feminine forms nomen sufficient distinguish daughter parents brothers thus need personal name unless multiple sisters household2
occurred praenomina could frequently used distinguish sisters however also common identify sisters using variety names could used either praenomina cognomina example publius servilius daughters would typically referred servilia major servilia minor daughters eldest might called servilia prima servilia maximaxv younger daughters servilia secunda tertia quarta names could used praenomina preceding nomen common usage later republic onward treat personal cognomina names appear either position frequently impossible determine whether intended praenomina cognomina1118
although womens praenomina infrequently used later republic continued used needed imperial times among peoples italy womens praenomina continued used regularly populace thoroughly romanized etruscan culture women held markedly higher social status rome ancient societies inscriptions referring women nearly always include praenomina18

aulia secunda daughter lucius


roman women known nomina distinction described older younger siblings distinction needed could identified particular citizens daughter wife instance cicero refers woman annia anni senatoris filia means annia daughter publius annius senator2 however toward republic hereditary cognomina came regarded proper names woman might referred cognomen instead combination nomen cognomen daughter lucius caecilius metellus usually referred caecilia metella sometimes cognomina given diminutive forms agrippina masculine agrippa drusilla drusus1
imperial times less formal names sometimes used distinguish women similar names still later roman women like adopted signa alternative names place roman names
fall western empire fifth century last traces distinctive italic nomenclature system began disappear women reverted single names
foreign namesedit
roman territory expanded beyond italy many foreigners obtained roman citizenship adopted roman names often discharged auxiliary soldiers leaders annexed towns peoples customarily newly enfranchised citizen would adopt praenomen nomen patron person adopted manumitted otherwise procured citizenship many individuals retained portion original names usually form cognomina especially true citizens greek origin name flavius aristodemus gaius julius hyginus would typical persons although form names distinguishable freedmenxvi1
constitutio antoniniana promulgated caracalla perhaps farreaching many imperial decrees enfranchising large numbers noncitizens living throughout empire extended citizenship free inhabitants empire thus received name marcus aurelius emperors praenomen nomen result vast numbers individuals never possessed praenomina nomina formally shared names turn many romans promptly discarded praenomina ignored nomina except required formality result cognomina adopted citizens often including original nonlatin names became important part nomenclature2
imperial namesedit
republic persons names usually static predictable unless adopted family obtained surname imperial times however names became highly variable subject change perhaps names variable emperors
example first emperor known conventionally augustus began life octavius gaius octavius gaius octavius ancestors borne name least four generations19 although octavii distinguished plebeian family gens divided stirpes hereditary cognomina octavius father slave revolt thurii sometimes given surname thurinus cognomen virtute name passed
eighteen octavius nominated magister equitum granduncle gaius julius caesar held office dictator ides march caesar assassinated without legitimate children adopted nephew became julius caesar octavianus gaius julius caesar octavianus gaius thus name follows republican model becoming adoptive father followed original nomen form agnomen
years later caesar deified roman senate octavian known styled divi divine caesar instead still later acclaimed imperator troops command octavian assumed title additional praenomen becoming julius divi caesar octavianus inscriptions original praenomen discarded altogether senate granted title augustus would ever affixed cognomen names roman emperors
similar pattern followed augustus heirs emperors stepson eventual successor born tiberius claudius nero adoption emperor became tiberius julius caesar retaining original praenomen brother born decimus claudius nero subsequently became nero claudius drusus exchanging original praenomen paternal cognomen assuming cognomen maternal grandfather members julioclaudian dynasty used praenomina drusus germanicus
subsequent generations reigning emperors assumed imperator additional praenomen usually without foregoing original praenomina augustus cognomen caesar came used cognomen designating heir apparent first centuries empire emperors adopted predecessors result emperor bore series names previous emperor names born added cognomina fought conquered enemies lands filiations recorded descent series gods names emperors changed names members families
later developmentedit
empire superficially naming conventions appear dissolve anarchy fact case conventions developed internally coherent20
binary nomenclature polyonymyedit
high empire aristocracy began adopting nomina practice termed binary nomenclature21 arose desire incorporate distinguished maternal ancestry name order inherit property heir required incorporate testators name name22 example suffect consul 1189 gaius bruttius praesens lucius fulvius rusticus name composed standard sets tria nomina natural lucius bruttius added nomina maternal grandfather lucius fulvius rusticus paternal nomina22
order reflect illustrious pedigree connections aristocracy expanded binary nomenclature concept include nomina individuals paternal maternal ancestry22 limit number names could added known polyonomy example consul usually called sosius priscus names comprising sets nomina reflecting complex pedigree stretching back three generations22
cognomen replaces praenomenedit
praenomen even classic system never particularly distinctive limited number praenomina available23 late republic century praenomen gradually became less used eventually disappeared altogether21 even among senatorial aristocracy became rarity ad21 part came tendency praenomen given males family thereby fossilizing particular preaenomennomen combination making praenomen even less distinctive males emperor vespasians family including sons praenomennomen combination titus flavius24

grandfather titus flavius petro
father titus flavius sabinus married vespasia polla
elder brother titus flavius sabinus whose titus flavius sabinus grandsons titus flavius sabinus titus flavius clemens
titus flavius vespasianus emperor known vespasianus married flavia domitilla
eldest titus flavius vespasianus emperor known titus
youngest titus flavius domitianus emperor known domitianus

cognomen vespasians family assumed distinguishing function individuals happened cognomen replaced praenomen intimate address24 result names remained formal public address instead praenomen nomen became nomen cognomen24
constitutio antoninianaedit
constitutio antoniniana emperor caracalla granted roman citizenship free inhabitants empire long expectation nonroman acquired citizenship part enfranchisement took roman name25 mass enfranchisement citizens adopted nomen aurelius recognition caracalla’s beneficence24 emperors full name marcus aurelius severus antoninus augustus aurelius nomen aurelius quickly became common nomen east second common julius west26 change origins governing elite assumed control empire century seen names emperors gallienus diocletian bore name marcus aurelius27
although praenomina adopted citizens reflecting preexisting decline amongst romans25 west names formulated basis existing roman practices26 east however citizens formulated names placing aurelius versions nonroman given name patronymic26 ultimately ubiquity aurelius meant could function true distinguishing nomen became primarily badge citizenship added name26
traditional nomen replacededit
although nomen would long required official purposes isolated corners empire parts italy usage would persist century nomen generally omitted name even emperors century28
factors encouraged frequent nonuse firstly cognomen increasingly became distinguishing name general name address28 result romans influence romans either dropped nomen name28 cases treated nomen praenomen27
secondly nomen becoming increasingly fossilized formality nonitalian families even acquired citizenship nomen prior began ignore nomen28 nomen required official purposes would simply default nomen aurelius front name rather actual nomen28

livy refers cognomen surname later roman practice third element roman tria nomina must remembered word nomen simply means name adoption second name praenomen would called thus first surnames adopted would known cognomina graduallyincreasing importance caused word nomen refer original personal name became known praenomen forename5
although individuals mentioned relation period romes legendary foundation eighth century known single name equally difficult discern represent actual historical figures whether names accurately remembered historians recorded myths centuries later romulus remus together fosterfather herdsman faustulus among easily remembered even supposing romulus remus names historical persons belonged theory royal house silvii might borne surname said fathered mars meanwhile faustulus represent mythical personage interjected romes foundation legend although noted name diminutive latin praenomen faustus almost persons mentioned part traditions surrounding romulus first king rome praenomen nomen46
common practice nearly latin praenomina gave rise patronymic nomina including many uncommon historical times
treatise praenominibus probus cites quintus mucius scaevola authority roman proposition boys receive praenomen assuming toga virilis signifying transition adulthood girls receive praenomen marriage3 appears refer sort formal ceremony praenomen granted confirmed rather original naming funerary inscriptions many romans died childhood conclusively demonstrate roman children praenomina4
usual exceptions policy well instance among fabii maximi several brothers single family named quintus first century flavii sabini bore praenomen titus distinguished generation different cognomina also praenomina grammatical gender brother sister could praenomen masculine feminine forms still easily distinguished
exceptions noted ancient historians example supposedly member junia gens named titus tiberius brothers name sons consul lucius junius brutus death plotting restore roman monarchy manlia gens said forbidden marcus condemnation marcus manlius capitolinus7 death marcus antonius execution decreed none antonii ever named marcus however supposed prohibitions subsequently broken
although term gentile origin term used distinguish nonjews jewish population meaning purely civil nothing ethnic religious identity simply refers member gens distinguished surname sense term gentile name used today without religious connotation despite perhaps christian name refer personal names sense romanized jews could also gentiles gentiles could jewish also origin term gentleman association gentlemen courtesy developed later
except course actual descendants ancient noble houses population roman empire grew attained social political influence romans accounted continually decreasing proportion overall populace
common abbreviations included flavius aurelius valerius claudius
aphrodito pagus nome aphroditopolis coptic jkow arabic ishkaw importance attached nomen flavius indicator bearers rank underscored fact basilius lived sixty years arab conquest egypt late examples within byzantine empire date eighth century2
also spelled atnepos atneptis
also spelled natus could abbreviated gnat perhaps confusingly
evidently exceptions well 4566 gives name fabia domitia secunda read gaiae filia inverted gaia common filiations freedmen apparently restricted woman referred fabia domitia secunda 1806 latter case giving fathers name inscriptions roman spain also notable doubled nomen cognomen secunda case really praenomen placed filiation common practice roman womens names period
note names father grandfather genetive quinti filius marci nepos mothers name ablative translation born simply idiomatic english born would also idiomatic could imply dative case
however eldest daughter might called nomen alone several years might continue called even birth younger sisters case younger sisters might receive distinctive personal names
cases filiation present would indicate someone freedman particular instances nomina suggest citizens provincial origin enfranchised imperial decree
