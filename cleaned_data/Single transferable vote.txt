counting votesedit
simplest method elimination transfers onlyedit
straightforward count ranked ballot vote simply sequentially identify candidate least support eliminate candidate transfer ballots nextnamed candidate ballot process repeated many candidates left seats available method used period time several local elections south australia effect identical instantrunoff voting commonly used leadership contests except transfer process terminated still several candidates remaining
refined method setting quotaedit
elections additional step taken ensures elected candidates elected approximately equal numbers votes shown candidate requires minimum number votes quota threshold elected number different quotas used common droop quota given floor function formula

droop quota extension requiring majority singlewinner elections example people 3winner elections 9winner elections
fractional votes submitted droop quota modified fraction rounded major frank britton election ballot services electoral reform society observed final plus droop quota never needed quota seat fifty hundred votes fiftyone10
finding winnersedit
election starts every voters first choice according following steps

candidate reached exceeded quota declared elected
elected candidate votes quota excess votes transferred candidates votes would gone winner next preference done several ways section counting methods
noone meets quota candidate fewest votes eliminated votes transferred voters next preferred candidate
process repeats either winner found every seat many seats remaining candidates

variations transfer surplus votes winning candidates whether transfer votes alreadyelected candidates number votes transferred losing candidate fewest votes small change ordering remaining candidates candidate eliminated simultaneously
simplistic formula transfer surplus votes







transferred votes given next preference

counting methodsedit
main article counting single transferable votes
also comparison hare droop quotas
systems primarily differ transfer votes size quota reason suggested considered family voting systems rather single system droop quota commonly used quota ensures majority rule except rare cases maintaining condition candidates reach quota seats filled hare quota used original proposals thomas hare11 ensures greater proportionality expense count votes guaranteeing majority rule
easiest methods transferring surpluses involve element randomness partially random systems used republic ireland except senate elections malta among places gregory method also known newlandbritain senatorial rules eliminates randomness allowing transfer fractions votes gregory northern ireland republic ireland senate elections australia gregory earlier methods problem circumstances treat votes equally reason meeks method warrens method wright system invented12 easier methods usually counted hand except small election meek warren require counting conducted computercitation needed wright system refinement australian senate system replacing process distribution segmentation preferences reiterative counting process count reset restarted every exclusion meek used local body elections zealand
meek 196913 first realize computers make possible count votes conceptually simpler closer original concept advantage meeks method quota adjusted stage counting number votes decreases become nontransferable meek also considered variant system allows equal preferences expressed14 subsequently since 1998 used john muir trust electing trustees15

thomas hare


although first propose transferable votes english barrister thomas hare generally credited conception independently developed idea 1857 hares view means making exercise suffrage step elevation individual character whether found majority minority hares original system proposed electors opportunity discovering candidate vote ultimately counted improve personal connection voting11 noted time hares original proposal secret ballot could voter determine ultimate role vote election elected would able determine voted hare envisaged whole house commons elected large would replaced geographical constituencies hare called constituencies interest people actually voted modern elections held secret ballot voter discover vote distributed viewing detailed election results particularly easy using meeks method final weightings candidate need published elected member however unable verify supporters
noted political essayist john stuart mill friend hares early proponent praising length essay considerations representative government writes modes national representation possibly constituted affords best security intellectual qualifications desirable representatives present persons elected possess local influence make lavish expenditure17 contemporary walter bagehot also praised hare system allowing everyone elect even ideological minorities also argued hare system would create problems solved hare system inconsistent extrinsic independence well inherent moderation parliament conditions seen essential bare possibility parliamentary government18
advocacy spread british empire leading sometimes known british proportional representation 1896 andrew inglis clark successful persuading tasmanian house assembly first parliament world elected became known hareclark electoral system named thomas hare wells strong advocate calling proportional representation19 wells formula scientific voting repeated many years writings avoid misunderstanding proportional representation single transferable vote large constituencies

issuesedit
main article issues affecting single transferable vote
degree proportionalityedit
degree proportionality election results depends directly district magnitude number seats district ireland originally median district magnitude five ranging three nine 1923 successive governments lowered systematically lowering number representatives given district directly benefits larger parties expense smaller ones
supposing droop quota used nineseat district quota threshold plus vote threeseat district would plus vote
parliamentary committee 2010 discussed increasing trend towards creation threeseat constituencies ireland recommended less fourseaters except geographic size constituency would disproportionately large26
provides proportionality transferring votes minimize waste therefore also minimizes number unrepresented disenfranchised voters
difficulty implementationedit
frequent concern complexity compared plurality voting methods advent computers complexity would made ballotcounting difficult voting methods
algorithm complicated large elections many candidates computer required several rounds counting many different categories previously transferred votes different permutation early preferences thus different carriedforward weighting kept track
role political partiesedit
differs proportional representation systems candidates party elected transfers voters parties hence reduce role political parties electoral process corresponding partisanship resulting government district needs four members proportional major partieswhere underrepresent smaller parties even though well likely elected first past post also small parties seen reasonable second preferences others green party ireland easily elected parties seen extreme others sinn féin ireland find harder attract second preferences therefore find harder seatscitation needed
byelectionsedit
multimember system filling vacancies elections problematic variety methods devised

countback method used australian capital territory tasmania victoria malta cambridge massachusetts casual vacancies could filled reexamining ballot papers data previous election
another option head official remaining members elected body appoint member fulfill vacancy
third fill vacancy hold singlewinner byelection effectively instantrunoff allows party choose candidate voters participate
another option would allow party vacant member nominate successor possibly subject approval voting population rest government
another possibility candidates create ordered list successors leaving seat european parliament departing republic ireland northern ireland member replaced eligible name replacement list submitted candidate time original election method also used northern ireland assembly changed 2009 allow political parties nominate mlas event vacancy independent mlas still draw list potential replacements27
2009 european elections malta oneoff policy elect candidate eliminated last filling prospective vacancy extra seat arise lisbon treaty

tacticsedit
also tactical voting single transferrable vote
enough candidates represent priorities electorate vote party elected early stages votes transferred candidates views hand putting many candidates might result first preference votes spread thinly among consequently several potential winners broad secondpreference appeal eliminated others elected secondpreference votes distributed practice majority voters express preference candidates party ordercitation needed minimizes impact potential effect
outcome voting proportional within single election collective preference voters assuming voters ranked real preferences vote along strict party lines assuming parties individual independents participate election however voting mechanisms usually used conjunction district constituency system election using guarantee proportionality across districts together
number methods tactical strategic voting exist used elections much less first past post elections constituencies marginal least regard allocation final seat
elector confusionedit
systems vary ballot design whether voters obliged provide full list preferences jurisdictions malta republic ireland northern ireland voters rank many candidates wish consequently voters sometimes example rank candidates single party preferred parties minority voters especially fully understand system even bullet vote expressing first preference indicate first preference multiple candidates especially plurality used concurrent elections28 allowing voters rank many candidates wish grants greater freedom also lead voters ranking candidates vote eventually becomes exhausted–that certain point count longer transferred therefore loses opportunity influence result
method confusing cause people vote incorrectly respect actual preferences ballots also long multiple pages also increases chances people missing later opportunities continue votingclarification needed
otheredit
opponentswho argue larger multiseat districts would require campaign funds reach voters proponents argue lower campaign costs likeminded candidates share expenses addition unlike atlarge plurality elections candidates secure support least voters allowing candidates focus campaign spending primarily supportive voters
analysis resultsedit
academic analysis voting systems generally centers voting system criteria pass preference voting system satisfies criteria arrows impossibility theorem particular fails achieve independence irrelevant alternatives like votebased ordering systems monotonicity
