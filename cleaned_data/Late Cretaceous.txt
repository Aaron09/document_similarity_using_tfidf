climateedit
late cretaceous climate warmer present although throughout period cooling trend evident2 tropics became restricted equatorial regions northern latitudes experienced markedly seasonal climatic conditions2
geographyedit
plate tectonics americas gradually moving westward causing atlantic ocean expand western interior seaway divided north america eastern western halves appalachia laramidia2 india maintained northward course towards asia2 southern hemisphere australia antarctica seem remained connected began drift away africa south america2 europe island chain2 populating islands endemic dwarf dinosaur species2
vertebrate faunaedit
dinosaursedit
late cretaceous hadrosaurs ankylosaurs ceratopsians experienced success asiamerica western north america eastern asia tyrannosaurs dominated large predator niche north america2 also present asia although usually smaller primitive north american varieties2 pachycephalosaurs also present north america asia2 dromaeosaurs shared geographical distribution well documented mongolia western north america2 contrast therizinosaurs known previously segnosaurs appear living solely asia2 gondwana held different dinosaurian fauna predators abelisaurs carcharodontosaurs titanosaurs among dominant herbivores2 spinosaurids also present time velociraptors also began time
birds became increasingly common diverse diversifying variety enantiornithe ornithurine forms early neornithes vegavis coexisted forms bizarre yungavolucris avisaurus though mostly small marine hesperornithes became relatively large flightless adapted life open
pterosaursedit
though primarily represented azhdarchids forms like pteranodontids tapejarids caiuajara bakonydraco nyctosaurids uncertain forms piksi navajodactylus also present historically assumed pterosaurs decline competition birds appears neither group overlapped significantly ecologically particularly evident true systematic decline ever place especially discovery smaller pterosaur species3
mammalsedit
several mammal groups began disappear last eutriconodonts occurring campanian north america4 northern hemisphere cimolodont multituberculates metatherians eutherians dominant mammals former groups common mammals north america southern hemisphere instead complex fauna dryolestoids gondwanatheres multituberculates basal eutherians monotremes presumably present last haramiyidans avashishta
mammals though generally small ranged variety ecological niches carnivores deltatheroida mollusceater stagodontidae herbivores multituberculates schowalteria zhelestidae mesungulatidae
true placentals evolved epoch said true marsupials instead nearly known eutherian metatherian fossils belong groups
marine lifeedit
seas mosasaurs suddenly appeared underwent spectacular evolutionary radiation modern sharks also appeared giantpenguinlike polycotylid plesiosaurs meters long huge longnecked elasmosaurs meters long also diversified predators numerous teleost fishes turn evolved advanced modern forms neoteleostei ichthyosaurs pliosaurs hand became extinct cenomanianturonian anoxic event
floraedit
near cretaceous period flowering plants diversified temperate regions familiar plants like magnolias sassafras roses redwoods willows could found abundance2
cretaceous–paleogene mass extinctionedit
main article cretaceous–paleogene extinction event
cretaceous–paleogene extinction event largescale mass extinction animal plant species geologically short period time approximately million years widely known extinction event associated geological signature usually thin band dated time found various parts world known cretaceous–paleogene boundary boundary traditional abbreviation cretaceous period derived german name kreidezeit abbreviation tertiary period historical term period time covered paleogene neogene periods event marks mesozoic beginning cenozoic era6 tertiary longer recognized formal time rock unit international commission stratigraphy event called cretaceous—paleogene extinction event many researchers
nonavian dinosaur fossils found cretaceous–paleogene boundary became extinct immediately event7 small number dinosaur fossils found cretaceous–paleogene boundary explained reworked fossils fossils eroded original locations preserved later sedimentary layers8910 mosasaurs plesiosaurs pterosaurs many species plants invertebrates also became extinct mammalian bird clades passed boundary extinctions evolutionary radiation maastrichtian clades occurred well past boundary rates extinction radiation varied across different clades organisms11
scientists hypothesized cretaceous–paleogene extinctions caused catastrophic events massive asteroid impacts increased volcanic activity several impact craters massive volcanic activity deccan traps dated approximate time extinction event geological events reduced sunlight hindered photosynthesis leading massive disruption earths ecology researchers believe extinction gradual resulting slower changes level climate11
