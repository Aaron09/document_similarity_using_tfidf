charles darwin proposed theory evolution 1859 major problems lack underlying mechanism heredity20 darwin believed blending inheritance inheritance acquired traits pangenesis blending inheritance would lead uniformity across populations generations would remove variation population natural selection could act21 darwin adopting lamarckian ideas later editions origin species later biological works22 darwins primary approach heredity outline appeared work noticing traits expressed explicitly parent time reproduction could inherited certain traits could sexlinked rather suggesting mechanisms
darwins initial model heredity adopted heavily modified cousin francis galton laid framework biometric school heredity23 galton found evidence support aspects darwins pangenesis model relied acquired traits24
inheritance acquired traits shown little basis 1880s august weismann tails many generations mice found offspring continued develop tails25

example pedigree chart sexlinked disorder gene chromosome


dominant recessive allelesedit
allele said dominant always expressed appearance organism phenotype provided least copy present example peas allele green pods dominant yellow pods thus plants pair alleles either homozygote heterozygote green pods allele yellow pods recessive effects allele seen present chromosomes homozygote
description mode biological inheritance consists three main categories

number involved loci

monogenetic also called simple locus
oligogenetic loci
polygenetic many loci




involved chromosomes




autosomal loci situated chromosome
gonosomal loci situated chromosome

xchromosomal loci situated xchromosome common case
ychromosomal loci situated ychromosome


mitochondrial loci situated mitochondrial




correlation genotype–phenotype

dominant
intermediate also called codominant
recessive
overdominant
underdominant



three categories part every exact description mode inheritance order addition specifications added follows

coincidental environmental interactions




penetrance

complete
incomplete percentual number


expressivity

invariable
variable


heritability polygenetic sometimes also oligogenetic modes inheritance
maternal paternal imprinting phenomena also epigenetics




sexlinked interactions




sexlinked inheritance gonosomal loci
sexlimited phenotype expression cryptorchism
inheritance maternal line case mitochondrial loci
inheritance paternal line case ychromosomal loci




locus–locus interactions

epistasis loci overdominance
gene coupling loci also crossing
homozygotous lethal factors
semilethal factors
