etymology
word flood comes english flod word common germanic languages compare german flut dutch vloed root seen flow float also compare latin fluctus flumen deluge myths mythical stories great flood sent deity deities destroy civilization divine retribution featured mythology many cultures
principal types
areal
floods happen flat lowlying areas water supplied rainfall snowmelt rapidly either infiltrate excess accumulates place sometimes hazardous depths surface soil become saturated effectively stops infiltration water table shallow floodplain intense rain series storms infiltration also slow negligible frozen ground rock concrete paving roofs areal flooding begins flat areas like floodplains local depressions connected stream channel velocity overland flow depends surface slope endorheic basins experience areal flooding periods precipitation exceeds evaporation4
riverine channel
floods occur types river stream channels smallest ephemeral streams humid zones normallydry channels arid climates worlds largest rivers overland flow occurs tilled fields result muddy flood sediments picked carried suspended matter load localized flooding caused exacerbated drainage obstructions landslides debris beaver dams
slowrising floods commonly occur large rivers large catchment areas increase flow result sustained rainfall rapid snow melt monsoons tropical cyclones however large rivers rapid flooding events areas climate since large basins small river channels rainfall intense smaller areas basins
rapid flooding events including flash floods often occur smaller rivers rivers steep valleys rivers flow much length impermeable terrain normallydry channels cause localized convective precipitation intense thunderstorms sudden release upstream impoundment created behind landslide glacier instance flash flood killed eight people enjoying water sunday afternoon popular waterfall narrow canyon without observed rainfall flow rate increased 1500 cubic feet second minute5 larger floods occurred site within week waterfall days deadly flood resulted thunderstorm part drainage basin steep bare rock slopes common thin soil already saturated
flash floods common flood type normallydry channels arid zones known arroyos southwest united states many names elsewhere setting first flood water arrive depleted wets sandy stream leading edge flood thus advances slowly later higher flows result rising limb hydrograph becomes ever quicker flood moves downstream flow rate great depletion wetting soil becomes insignificant
estuarine coastal
flooding estuaries commonly caused combination tidal surges caused winds barometric pressure exacerbated high upstream river flow
coastal areas flooded storm events resulting waves overtopping defenses severe cases tsunami tropical cyclones storm surge either tropical cyclone extratropical cyclone falls within category research national hurricane center explains storm surge abnormal rise water generated storm predicted astronomical tides storm surge confused storm tide defined water level rise combination storm surge astronomical tide rise water level cause extreme flooding coastal areas particularly storm surge coincides normal high tide resulting storm tides reaching feet cases6
urban flooding
urban flooding inundation land property built environment particularly densely populated areas caused rainfall overwhelming capacity drainage systems storm sewers although sometimes triggered events flash flooding snowmelt urban flooding condition characterized repetitive systemic impacts communities happen regardless whether affected communities located within designated floodplains near body water7 aside potential overflow rivers lakes snowmelt stormwater water released damaged water mains accumulate property public rightsofway seep building walls floors backup buildings sewer pipes toilets sinks
urban areas flood effects exacerbated existing paved streets roads increase speed flowing water
flood flow urbanized areas constitutes hazard population infrastructure recent catastrophes include inundations nîmes france 1998 vaisonlaromaine france 1992 flooding orleans 2005 flooding rockhampton bundaberg brisbane 2010–2011 summer queensland australia flood flows urban environments studied relatively recently despite many centuries flood events8 recent research considered criteria safe evacuation individuals flooded areas9
catastrophic
catastrophic riverine flooding usually associated major infrastructure failures collapse also caused drainage channel modification landslide earthquake volcanic eruption examples include outburst floods lahars tsunamis cause catastrophic coastal flooding commonly resulting undersea earthquakes
causes

upslope factors
amount location timing water reaching drainage channel natural precipitation controlled uncontrolled reservoir releases determines flow downstream locations precipitation evaporates slowly percolates soil temporarily sequestered snow produce rapid runoff surfaces including rock pavement roofs saturated frozen ground fraction incident precipitation promptly reaching drainage channel observed light rain level ground high percent warm rain accumulated snow10
precipitation records based measured depth water received within fixed time interval frequency precipitation threshold interest determined number measurements exceeding threshold value within total time period observations available individual data points converted intensity dividing measured depth period time observations intensity less actual peak intensity duration rainfall event less fixed time interval measurements reported convective precipitation events thunderstorms tend produce shorter duration storm events orographic precipitation duration intensity frequency rainfall events important flood prediction short duration precipitation significant flooding within small drainage basins11
important upslope factor determining flood magnitude land area watershed upstream area interest rainfall intensity second important factor watersheds less approximately square miles square kilometres main channel slope second important factor larger watersheds channel slope rainfall intensity become third important factors small large watersheds respectively12
time concentration time required runoff distant point upstream drainage area reach point drainage channel controlling flooding area interest time concentration defines critical duration peak rainfall area interest13 critical duration intense rainfall might minutes roof parking drainage structures cumulative rainfall several days would critical river basins
downslope factors
water flowing downhill ultimately encounters downstream conditions slowing movement final limitation often ocean natural artificial lake elevation changes tidal fluctuations significant determinants coastal estuarine flooding less predictable events like tsunamis storm surges also cause elevation changes large bodies water elevation flowing water controlled geometry flow channel12 flow channel restrictions like bridges canyons tend control water elevation restriction actual control point given reach drainage change changing water elevation closer point control lower water levels distant point controls higher water levels
effective flood channel geometry changed growth vegetation accumulation debris construction bridges buildings levees within flood channel
coincidence
extreme flood events often result coincidence unusually intense warm rainfall melting heavy snow pack producing channel obstructions floating releasing small impoundments like beaver dams14 coincident events cause extensive flooding frequent anticipated simplistic statistical prediction models considering precipitation runoff flowing within unobstructed drainage channels15 debris modification channel geometry common heavy flows move uprooted woody vegetation flooddamaged structures vehicles including boats railway equipment recent field measurements 2010–11 queensland floods showed criterion solely based upon flow velocity water depth specific momentum cannot account hazards caused velocity water depth fluctuations8 considerations ignore risks associated large debris entrained flow motion9
researchers mentioned storage effect urban areas transportation corridors created fill culverted fills converted impoundments culverts become blocked debris flow diverted along streets several studies looked flow patterns redistribution streets storm events implication flood modelling16
effects
primary effects
primary effects flooding include loss life damage buildings structures including bridges sewerage systems roadways canals
floods also frequently damage power transmission sometimes power generation knockon effects caused loss power includes loss drinking water treatment water supply result loss drinking water severe water contamination also cause loss sewage disposal facilities lack clean water combined human sewage flood waters raises risk waterborne diseases include typhoid giardia cryptosporidium cholera many diseases depending upon location flood
damage roads transport infrastructure make difficult mobilize affected provide emergency health treatment
flood waters typically inundate farm land making land unworkable preventing crops planted harvested lead shortages food humans farm animals entire harvests country lost extreme flood circumstances tree species survive prolonged flooding root systems17
secondary longterm effects
economic hardship temporary decline tourism rebuilding costs food shortages leading price increases common aftereffect severe flooding impact affected cause psychological damage affected particular deaths serious injuries loss property occur
urban flooding lead chronically houses linked increase respiratory problems illnesses18 urban flooding also significant economic implications affected neighborhoods united states industry experts estimate basements lower property values 10–25 percent cited among reasons purchasing home19 according federal emergency management agency fema almost percent small businesses never reopen doors following flooding disaster20 united states insurance available flood damage homes businesses21
benefits
floods particular frequent smaller floods also bring many benefits recharging ground water making soil fertile increasing nutrients soils flood waters provide much needed water resources arid semiarid regions precipitation unevenly distributed throughout year kills pests farming land freshwater floods particularly play important role maintaining ecosystems river corridors factor maintaining floodplain biodiversity22 flooding spread nutrients lakes rivers lead increased biomass improved fisheries years
fish species inundated floodplain form highly suitable location spawning predators enhanced levels nutrients food23 fish weather fish make floods order reach habitats bird populations also profit boost food production caused flooding24
periodic flooding essential wellbeing ancient communities along tigriseuphrates rivers nile river indus river ganges yellow river among others viability hydropower renewable source energy also higher flood prone regions
flood safety planning
basic level best defense floods seek higher ground highvalue uses balancing foreseeable risks benefits occupying flood hazard zones2522–23 critical communitysafety facilities hospitals emergencyoperations centers police fire rescue services built areas least risk flooding structures bridges must unavoidably flood hazard areas designed withstand flooding areas risk flooding could valuable uses could abandoned temporarily people retreat safer areas flood imminent
