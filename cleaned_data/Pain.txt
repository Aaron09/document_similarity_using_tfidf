classificationedit
1994 responding need useful system describing chronic pain international association study pain iasp classified pain according specific characteristics

region body involved abdomen lower limbs
system whose dysfunction causing pain nervous gastrointestinal
duration pattern occurrence
intensity time since onset
cause11

however system criticized clifford woolf others inadequate guiding research treatment12 woolf suggests three classes pain

nociceptive pain
inflammatory pain associated tissue damage infiltration immune cells
pathological pain disease state caused damage nervous system abnormal function fibromyalgia peripheral neuropathy tension type headache etc13

durationedit
main article chronic pain
pain usually transitory lasting noxious stimulus removed underlying damage pathology healed painful conditions rheumatoid arthritis peripheral neuropathy cancer idiopathic pain persist years pain lasts long time called chronic persistent pain resolves quickly called acute traditionally distinction acute chronic pain relied upon arbitrary interval time onset commonly used markers months months since onset pain14 though theorists researchers placed transition acute chronic pain months1593 others apply acute pain lasts less days chronic pain months duration subacute pain lasts months16 popular alternative definition chronic pain involving arbitrarily fixed durations pain extends beyond expected period healing14 chronic pain classified cancer pain else benign16
nociceptiveedit
main article nociception
nociceptive pain caused stimulation sensory nerve fibers respond stimuli approaching exceeding harmful intensity nociceptors classified according mode noxious stimulation common categories thermal heat cold mechanical crushing tearing shearing chemical iodine chemicals released inflammation nociceptors respond modalities consequently designated polymodal
nociceptive pain also divided visceral deep somatic superficial somatic pain visceral structures highly sensitive stretch ischemia inflammation relatively insensitive stimuli normally evoke pain structures burning cutting visceral pain diffuse difficult locate often referred distant usually superficial structure accompanied nausea vomiting described sickening deep squeezing dull17 deep somatic pain initiated stimulation nociceptors ligaments tendons bones blood vessels fasciae muscles dull aching poorlylocalized pain examples include sprains broken bones superficial pain initiated activation nociceptors skin superficial tissue sharp welldefined clearly located examples injuries produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds minor first degree burns15

psychogenicedit
main article psychogenic pain
psychogenic pain also called psychalgia somatoform pain pain caused increased prolonged mental emotional behavioral factors25 headache back pain stomach pain sometimes diagnosed psychogenic25 sufferers often stigmatized medical professionals general public tend think pain psychological source real however specialists consider less actual hurtful pain source26

three dimensions painedit
1968 ronald melzack kenneth casey described pain terms three dimensions

sensorydiscriminative sense intensity location quality duration pain
