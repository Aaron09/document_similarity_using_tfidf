circuit switching method implementing telecommunications network network nodes establish dedicated communications channel circuit network nodes communicate circuit guarantees full bandwidth channel remains connected duration communication session circuit functions nodes physically connected electrical circuit
defining example circuitswitched network early analog telephone network call made telephone another switches within telephone exchanges create continuous wire circuit telephones long call lasts
circuit switching contrasts packet switching divides data transmitted packets transmitted network independently packet switching instead dedicated communication session time network links shared packets multiple competing communication sessions resulting loss quality service guarantees provided circuit switching
circuit switching delay constant connection opposed packet switching packet queues cause varying potentially indefinitely long packet transfer delays circuit degraded competing users protected callers circuit released connection even actual communication taking place channel remains reserved protected competing users
virtual circuit switching packet switching technology emulates circuit switching sense connection established packets transferred packets delivered order
circuit switching commonly used connecting voice circuits concept dedicated path persisting communicating parties nodes extended signal content voice advantage using circuit switching provides continuous transfer without overhead associated packets making maximal available bandwidth communication disadvantage relatively inefficient unused capacity guaranteed connection cannot used connections network

compared datagram packet switchingedit
circuit switching contrasts packet switching divides data transmitted small units called packets transmitted network independently packet switching shares available network bandwidth multiple communication sessions
multiplexing multiple telecommunications connections physical conductor possible long time nonetheless channel multiplexed link either dedicated call time idle calls
circuit switching route associated bandwidth reserved source destination making circuit switching relatively inefficient since capacity reserved whether connection continuous
contrast packet switching process segmenting data transmitted several smaller packets packet labeled destination sequence number ordering related packets precluding need dedicated path help packet find destination packet dispatched independently routed different path destination original message reordered based packet number reproduce original message result datagram packet switching networks require circuit established allow many pairs nodes communicate concurrently channel
