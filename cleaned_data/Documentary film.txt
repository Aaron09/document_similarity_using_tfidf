translationedit
several challenges associated translation documentaries main working conditions problems terminology
working conditionsedit
documentary translators often meet tight deadlines normally translator five seven days hand translation 90minute programme dubbing studios typically give translators week translate documentary order earn good salary translators deliver translations much shorter period usually studio decides deliver final programme client sooner broadcasting channel sets tight deadline documentaries discussing latest news26
another problem lack postproduction script poor quality transcription correct transcription essential translator work properly however many times script even given translator major impediment since documentaries characterised abundance terminological units specific proper names27 script given translator usually poorly transcribed outright incorrect making translation unnecessarily difficult demanding proper names specific terminology correct documentary programme order reliable source information hence translator check every term mistakes proper names instance jungle reinhard instead django reinhart jorn asten instead jane austen magnus axle instead aldous huxley27
terminologyedit
process translation documentary programme requires working specific often scientific terminology documentary translators usually specialist given field therefore compelled undertake extensive research whenever asked make translation specific documentary programme order understand correctly deliver final product free mistakes inaccuracies generally documentaries contain large amount specific terms translators familiarise example

documentary beetles record breakers makes different terms refer beetles less minutes longhorn beetle cellar beetle stag beetle burying beetle gravediggers sexton beetle tiger beetle bloody nose beetle tortoise beetle diving beetle devil’s coach horse weevil click beetle malachite beetle beetle cockchafer apart mentioning animals horseshoe bats meadow brown butterflies28

poses real challenge translators render meaning find equivalent specific scientific term target language frequently narrator uses general name instead specific term translator rely image presented programme understand term discussed order transpose target language accordingly29 additionally translators minorised languages often face another problem terms even exist target language case create terminology consult specialists find proper solutions also sometimes official nomenclature differs terminology used actual specialists leaves translator decide using official vocabulary found dictionary rather opting spontaneous expressions used real experts real life situations30
