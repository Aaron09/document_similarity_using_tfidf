highyielding varieties
highyielding varieties group crops created intentionally green revolution increase global food production project enabled labor markets asia shift away agriculture industrial sectors first rice produced 1966 international rice research institute based philippines university philippines baños site created cross indonesian variety named peta chinese variety named gen162
scientists identified cloned many genes involved gibberellin signaling pathway including gai1 gibberellin insensitive slr1 slender rice163 disruption gibberellin signaling lead significantly reduced stem growth leading dwarf phenotype photosynthetic investment stem reduced dramatically shorter plants inherently stable mechanically assimilates become redirected grain production amplifying particular effect chemical fertilizers commercial yield presence nitrogen fertilizers intensive crop management varieties increase yield three times
future potential
millennium development project seeks spread global economic development africa green revolution cited model economic development intent replicating successful asian boom agronomic productivity groups like earth institute research african agricultural systems hoping increase productivity important happen production rices africa nerica rices selected tolerate input harsh growing conditions african agriculture produced african rice center billed technology africa africa nerica appeared york times october 2007 international herald tribune october 2007 trumpeted miracle crops dramatically increase rice yield africa enable economic resurgence ongoing research china develop perennial rice could result enhanced sustainability food security
golden rice
main article golden rice
rice kernels contain vitamin people obtain calories rice risk vitamin deficiency german swiss researchers genetically engineered rice produce betacarotene precursor vitamin rice kernel betacarotene turns processed white rice gold color hence name golden rice betacarotene converted vitamin humans consume rice164 although rice strains produce betacarotene hull nongenetically engineered strains found produce betacarotene kernel despite testing thousands strains additional efforts made improve quantity quality nutrients golden rice165
international rice research institute currently developing evaluating golden rice potential help address vitamin deficiency166
expression human proteins
ventria bioscience genetically modified rice express lactoferrin lysozyme proteins usually found breast milk human serum albumin proteins antiviral antibacterial antifungal effects167
rice containing added proteins used component oral rehydration solutions used treat diarrheal diseases thereby shortening duration reducing recurrence supplements also help reverse anemia168
floodtolerant rice
varying levels water reach regions cultivation flood tolerant varieties long developed used flooding issue many rice growers face especially south south east asia flooding annually affects million hectares169 standard rice varieties cannot withstand stagnant flooding week170 mainly disallows plant access necessary requirements sunlight essential exchanges inevitably leading plants unable recover169 past massive losses yields philippines 2006 rice crops worth million lost flooding171 recently developed cultivars seek improve flood tolerance
droughttolerant rice
drought represents significant environmental stress rice production 19–23 million hectares rainfed rice production south south east asia often risk172173 drought conditions without sufficient water afford ability obtain required levels nutrients soil conventional commercial rice varieties severely affected example yield losses high affected parts india resulting losses around us800 million annually174
international rice research institute conducts research developing droughttolerant rice varieties including varieties 5411 sookha dhan currently employed farmers philippines nepal respectively173 addition 2013 japanese national institute agrobiological sciences team successfully inserted deeper rooting dro1 gene philippine upland rice variety kinandang patong popular commercial rice variety ir64 giving rise deeper root system resulting plants174 facilitates improved ability rice plant derive required nutrients times drought accessing deeper layers soil feature demonstrated trials ir64 dro1 rice yields drop moderate drought conditions compared unmodified ir64 variety174175
salttolerant rice
soil salinity poses major threat rice crop productivity particularly along lowlying coastal areas season172 example roughly million hectares coastal areas bangladesh affected saline soils176 high concentrations salt severely affect rice plants’ normal physiology especially early stages growth farmers often forced abandon otherwise potentially usable areas177178
progress made however developing rice varieties capable tolerating conditions hybrid created cross commercial rice variety ir56 wild rice species oryza coarctata example179 coarctata capable successful growth soils double limit salinity normal varieties lacks ability produce edible rice179 developed international rice research institute hybrid variety utilise specialised leaf glands allow removal salt atmosphere initially produced successful embryo 34000 crosses species backcrossed ir56 preserving genes responsible salt tolerance inherited coarctata177 extensive trials planned prior variety available farmers approximately 2017–18177




irrigated rice paddy crop egypt salt tolerance ece55 beyond yield declines180


problem soil salinity arises opportune select salt tolerant varieties irri resort soil salinity control
soil salinity often measured electric conductivity extract saturated soil paste units usually expressed millimhocm critical value figure obtained measurements farmers fields indicates rice crop slightly salt sensitive
environmentfriendly rice
producing rice paddies harmful environment release methane methanogenic bacteria bacteria live anaerobic waterlogged soil live nutrients released rice roots researchers recently reported nature putting barley gene susiba2 rice creates shift biomass production root shoot ground tissue becomes larger ground tissue reduced decreasing methanogen population resulting reduction methane emissions apart environmental benefit modification also increases amount rice grains makes useful tool feeding growing world population182183
meiosis repair
rice used model organism investigating molecular mechanisms meiosis repair higher plants meiosis stage sexual cycle diploid cells ovule female structure anther male structure produce haploid cells develop gametophytes gametes meiotic genes rice characterized184 studies rice gene osrad51c showed gene necessary homologous recombinational repair particularly accurate repair doublestrand breaks meiosis185 rice gene osdmc1 found essential pairing homologous chromosomes meiosis186 rice gene osmre11 found required synapsis homologous chromosomes repair doublestrand breaks meiosis187
cultural roles rice

rice plays important role certain religions popular beliefs many cultures relatives scatter rice towards wedding ceremony front bride groom188
pounded rice ritual conducted weddings nepal bride gives leafplate full pounded rice groom requests politely her189
philippines rice wine popularly known tapuy used important occasions weddings rice harvesting ceremonies celebrations190
