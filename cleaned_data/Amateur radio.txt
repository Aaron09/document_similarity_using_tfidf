term first pejorative term used professional wired telegraphy 19th century mock operators poor morse code sending skills hamfisted10111213 term continued used invention radio proliferation amateur experimentation wireless telegraphy among land seabased professional radio operators amateurs considered nuisance meaning amateurish unskilled survives today disciplines actor
amateur radio community subsequently began reclaim word label pride14 mid20th century lost pejorative meaning although acronym often mistakenly written capital letters
activities practicesedit
many facets amateur radio attract practitioners wide range interests many amateurs begin fascination radio communication combine personal interests make pursuit hobby rewarding focal areas amateurs pursue include radio contesting radio propagation study public service communication technical experimentation computer networking
amateur radio operators various modes transmission communicate common modes voice transmissions frequency modulation single sideband offers high quality audio signals better long distance communication bandwidth restricted15
radiotelegraphy using morse code also known continuous wave wireless extension landline wired telegraphy developed samuel morse dates earliest days radio although computerbased digital modes methods largely replaced commercial military applications many amateur radio operators still enjoy using mode—particularly shortwave bands experimental work earthmoonearth communication inherent signaltonoise ratio advantages morse using internationally agreed message encodings code enables communication amateurs speak different languages also popular homebrewers particular verylowpower enthusiasts cwonly transmitters simpler construct human earbrain signal processing system pull weak signals noise voice signals would totally inaudible similar legacy mode popular home constructors amplitude modulation pursued many vintage amateur radio enthusiasts aficionados vacuum tube technology
demonstrating proficiency morse code many years requirement obtain amateur license transmit frequencies following changes international regulations 2003 countries longer required demand proficiency16 united states federal communications commission example phased requirement license classes february 20071718
modern personal computers encouraged digital modes radioteletype rtty previously required cumbersome mechanical equipment19 hams development packet radio 1970s employed protocols ax25 tcpip specialized digital modes psk31 allow realtime lowpower communications shortwave bands echolink using voice technology enabled amateurs communicate local internetconnected repeaters radio nodes20 irlp allowed linking repeaters provide greater coverage area automatic link establishment enabled continuous amateur radio networks operate high frequency bands global coverage modes fsk441 using software wsjt used weak signal modes including meteor scatter moonbounce communications
fast scan amateur television gained popularity hobbyists adapt inexpensive consumer video electronics like camcorders video cards wide bandwidth stable signals required amateur television typically found 420–450 frequency range though also limited 902–928 1240–1300 higher requirements also effectively limit signal range miles 30–100
linked repeater systems however allow transmissions higher frequencies across hundreds miles21 repeaters usually located heights land tall structures allow operators communicate hundreds miles using handheld mobile transceivers repeaters also linked together using amateur radio bands landline internet

amateur radio operator uses call sign legally identify operator andor station35 countries call sign assigned station must always used whereas countries call sign either operator station used36 certain jurisdictions operator also select vanity call sign although must also conform issuing governments allocation structure used amateur radio call signs37 jurisdictions require obtain vanity call sign others required vanity call sign selected license applied discontinued vanity call sign applications september 201538
call sign structure prescribed consists three parts break follows using call sign zs1nat example

shows country call sign originates also indicate license class call sign licensed south africa
gives subdivision country territory indicated first part refers western cape
final part unique holder license identifying station specifically

many countries follow convention numeral united kingdom original calls g0xxx g2xxx g3xxx g4xxx full license holders along last m0xxx full call signs issued city guilds examination authority december 2003 additional full licenses originally granted licensees g1xxx g6xxx g7xxx g8xxx 1991 onward m1xxx callsigns newer threelevel intermediate license holders assigned 2e0xxx 2e1xx basic foundation license holders granted call signs m3xxx m6xxx39
instead using numbers second letter initial identifies station’s location example callsign g7ooe becomes gm7ooe license holder operating station scotland prefix scotland england omitted wales information available radio media licensing authority ofcom website

privilegesedit
administrations unlike spectrum users radio amateurs build modify transmitting equipment within amateur spectrum without need obtain government certification equipment4546 licensed amateurs also frequency bands rather allocated fixed frequencies channels operate medium highpowered equipment wide range frequencies47 long meet certain technical parameters including occupied bandwidth power prevention spurious emission
radio amateurs access frequency allocations throughout spectrum usually allowing choice effective frequency communications across local regional worldwide path shortwave bands suitable worldwide communication bands normally provide local regional communication microwave bands enough space bandwidth amateur television transmissions highspeed computer networks




international symbol amateur radio included logos many iaru member societies diamond holds circuit diagram featuring components common every radio antenna inductor ground


countries amateur radio license grants permission license holder modify operate equipment certified governmental regulatory agency encourages amateur radio operators experiment homeconstructed modified equipment equipment must still satisfy national international standards spurious emissions
amateur radio operators encouraged regulations tradition respectful spectrum little power possible accomplish communication48 minimise interference device although allowable power levels moderate commercial standards sufficient enable global communication lower license classes usually lower power limits example lowest license class foundation licence limit
power limits vary country country license classes within country example peak envelope power limits highest available license classes selected countries canada49 united states belgium luxembourg switzerland zealand germany italy australia india united kingdom oman
output power limits also depend mode transmission australia example used transmissions modes limited
point power output measured also affect transmissions united kingdom measures point antenna connected signal feed cable means radio system transmit overcome signal loss cable conversely germany measures power output final amplification stage results loss radiated power longer cable feedscitation needed
certain countries permit amateur radio licence holders hold notice variation allows higher power used normally allowed certain specific purposes amateur radio licence holders allowed transmit using experiments entailing using moon passive radio reflector known earthmoonearth communication
