grid lettersedit

first letter grid divided squares size outlined dark grey right four contain significant land area within great britain square contains tiny area north yorkshire almost lies mean high tide5
second letter square subdivided squares size letter code omitting starting northwest corner southeast corner squares outlined light grey containing land lettered central meridian shown
would possible extend grid system ireland completing squares introducing would become squares arrangement first letters following pattern second letter however motion moment accuracy projection would start diminish west ireland degrees central meridian theoretically system extends atlantic ocean well western europe square near iceland square northern italy fact rockall mapped ordnance survey usually shown inset without gridlines mainland sheet however grid extended rockall grid square mcoriginal research
grid digitsedit
within square eastings northings south west corner square given numerically example nh0325 means square whose southwest corner east north southwest corner square location indicated varying resolutions numerically usually digits coordinate square five square case first half digits first coordinate second half common usage figure grid reference employing three digits coordinate determine square example grid reference square containing summit nevis grid references written without spaces also nn166712 easting northing osgb36 national grid location nevis 216600 771200
allnumeric grid referencesedit
grid references also quoted pair numbers eastings northings metres measured southwest corner square note digits required locations orkney north example grid reference sullom terminal shetland islands given hu396753 4396681175316
another distinct form allnumeric grid reference abbreviated alphanumeric reference letters simply omitted 166712 summit nevis unlike numeric references described abbreviated grid reference incomplete gives location relative 100×100 square specify square often used informally context identifies 2letter square example within context location known landranger sheet extends nn000500 southwest nn400900 northeast abbreviated grid reference 166712 equivalent nn166712 working landranger sheet also given 41166712
alternatively sometimes numbers instead twoletter combinations used 100×100 squares numbering follows grid index tens denote progress west east units south north north scotland numbering modified square north numbered square north
