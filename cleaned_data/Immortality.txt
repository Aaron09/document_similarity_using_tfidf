traumaedit
physical trauma would remain threat perpetual physical life otherwise immortal person would still subject unforeseen accidents catastrophes speed quality paramedic response remains determining factor surviving severe trauma9 body could automatically repair severe trauma speculated uses nanotechnology would mitigate factor seat consciousness brain cannot risked trauma continuous physical life maintained aversion trauma risk brain would naturally result significant behavioral changes would render physical immortality undesirable people
