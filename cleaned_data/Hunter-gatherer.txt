1970s lewis binford suggested early humans obtaining food scavenging hunting4 early humans lower paleolithic lived forests woodlands allowed collect seafood eggs nuts fruits besides scavenging rather killing large animals meat according view used carcasses animals either killed predators died natural causes5 archaeological genetic data suggest source populations paleolithic huntergatherers survived sparsely wooded areas dispersed areas high primary productivity avoiding dense forest cover6
according endurance running hypothesis longdistance running persistence hunting method still practiced huntergatherer groups modern times likely driving evolutionary force leading evolution certain human characteristics hypothesis necessarily contradict scavenging hypothesis subsistence strategies could sequentially alternating even simultaneously
hunting gathering presumably subsistence strategy employed human societies beginning million years homo erectus appearance million years homo sapiens remained mode subsistence mesolithic period 10000 years replaced gradually spread neolithic revolution
starting transition middle upper paleolithic period 80000 70000 years huntergatherers bands began specialize concentrating hunting smaller selection often larger game gathering smaller selection food specialization work also involved creating specialized tools fishing nets hooks bone harpoons7 transition subsequent neolithic period chiefly defined unprecedented development nascent agricultural practices agriculture originated spread several different areas including middle east asia mesoamerica andes beginning early 12000 years

habitat populationedit
huntergatherers nomadic seminomadic live temporary settlements mobile communities typically construct shelters using impermanent building materials natural rock shelters available
huntergatherer cultures indigenous peoples pacific northwest coast lived particularly rich environments allowed sedentary semisedentary
social economic structureedit
huntergatherers tend egalitarian social ethos although settled huntergatherers example inhabiting northwest coast north america exception rule nearly african huntergatherers egalitarian women roughly influential powerful men11 karl marx defined socioeconomic system primitive communism12

common arrangement sexual division labour women gathering concentrate game hunting huntergatherer societies women appreciate meat brought back camp illustrative account megan bieseles study southern african juhoan women like meat23 recent archaeological research suggests sexual division labor fundamental organisational innovation gave homo sapiens edge neanderthals allowing ancestors migrate africa spread across globe24
