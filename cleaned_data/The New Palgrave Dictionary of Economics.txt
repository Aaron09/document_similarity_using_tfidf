reviewsedit
general remarksedit
reviewing 1987 edition york times robert solow concluded dictionary special sense excellent survey articles various sizes various subjects best written professionals professionals according solow graduate students economics would find dictionary useful articles would inaccessible noneconomists even undergraduate students liberal arts economists however dictionary provided many excellent overviews contemporary research7 response editor milgate 1992 confirmed articles written audience professional economists neither general reading public specialist economists
mathematics contemporary economicsedit
according milgate palgrave downplayed mathematics comparison leading economic journals columns contained mathematics required expensive handtypesetting recent issue american economic review fact lacked mathematics according milgate averred aers mathematical usage typical leading contemporary journals palgraves usage mathematics reciprocal contemporary professions milgate 1992 must concluded palgrave actually underrepresented mathematical element modern economics underrepresented significant degree wrote milgate 1992
commenting contemporary economics solow described technical economics essential infrastructure

lesson fate palgrave economics longer conversation piece ladies gentlemen become technical subject like technical subject attracts people interested technique subject inevitable case technical core economics indispensable infrastructure political economy consult palgrave looking enlightenment world today technical economics history nothing all7

advanced mathematics implicit articles many well written reasonably accessible solow recommended broad deep article game theory robert aumann wellequipped graduate students along john harsanyis article bargaining theory articles financial economics written best people—stephen ross robert merton others—and show however difficult average investor complimenting article international trade solow added caveat lector forbid reader without knowledge economics understand protectionism consulting palgrave7
review george stigler commended dictionarys nontechnical conceptually rich article social choice written kenneth arrow among numerous excellent articles however stigler criticized inclusion dozens articles mathematical economics failed provide intuitive introductions problem solved solution articles written tolerably competent economist exclusively fellow specialists8
exclusion empirical materialedit
whitaker wrote readers economics nothing science based empirical inquiry dismayed lack attention empirical studies factual matters9
stigler criticized palgrave largely ignoring empirical economics—economic data summary statistics econometric investigations according stigler empirical investigation consumption production functions profoundly influenced microeconomic theory empirical investigation price levels profoundly influenced monetary economics palgraves neglect empirical economics also weakened treatment economic theory history economic thought furthermore editors failed explain neglect empirical economics gave large space treatments technical economics especially mathematical economics faddish topics wrote stigler10
article profit profit theory contain single number profits ever united states country reference source might provide number wrote herbert stein complained articles elasticities estimate elasticity anything11
reviewing critics overemphasis theoretical doctrinal economics editor milgate admitted palgrave flawed neglect empirical economics12
criticisms undue weight heterodox approachesedit
robert solow criticized 1987 edition slighting mainstream economics giving excessive space dissenting fringes within academic economics namely marxist economics well austrian persuasion postkeynesians neoricardian7

nevertheless usually definite consensus—there now—and accurate picture discipline would make clear would give dissent fair shake would treat mainstream ideas critically keep various paradigms proportion think palgrave managed
obvious though important manifestation imbalance large number items devoted marxist themes abstract concrete labor vulgar economy articles informative mystifying point marx important influential thinker marxism doctrine intellectual practical influence fact however serious englishspeaking economists regard marxist economics irrelevant dead palgrave take issue head think gives false impression state play deadpan statement rather medical dictionary intersperse articles mainstream orthopedics written orthopedists articles osteopathy written osteopaths leave that7

1987 dictionarys discussion heterodox approaches also criticized george stigler complained articles written sympathetic editors partisan manner

selection sympathetic writers fact general practice palgrave israel kirzners essay austrian economists hint existence error misrepresentation critics tasteless attacks upon german historical school klaus henning little better böhmbawerk ersatz austrian apparently loyal genuine article8 italics added

stigler complained extensive biased articles marxist economics including neoricardian economists follow piero sraffa nonprofessional reader would never guess volumes economists working marxiansraffian tradition represent small minority modern economists writings virtually impact upon professional work economists major englishlanguage universities stigler provided table articles biased marxist orthodoxy criticized authors name especially violently promarxist entry macpherson8
