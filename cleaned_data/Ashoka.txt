perceptions historiography
buddhist sources reconstructing life ashoka strong influence perceptions ashoka well interpretations edicts building traditional accounts early scholars regarded ashoka primarily buddhist monarch underwent conversion buddhism actively engaged sponsoring supporting buddhist monastic institution scholars tended question assessment romila thappar writes ashoka need statesman context inheriting sustaining empire particular historical period person strong commitment changing society might called propagation social ethics51 source information attributable buddhist sources ashokan edicts explicitly state ashoka buddhist edicts ashoka expresses support major religions time buddhism brahmanism jainism ajivikaism edicts addressed population large addressed specifically buddhists case religions generally focus moral themes members religions would accept example amartya writes indian emperor ashoka third century presented many political inscriptions favor tolerance individual freedom part state policy relation different people other52
however edicts alone strongly indicate buddhist edict belittles rituals banned vedic animal sacrifices strongly suggest least look vedic tradition guidance furthermore many edicts expressed buddhists alone ashoka declares upasaka another demonstrates close familiarity buddhist texts erected rock pillars buddhist holy sites sites religions also used word dhamma refer qualities heart underlie moral action exclusively buddhist word however used word spirit strict code conduct romila thappar writes dhamma derive divine inspiration even observance promised heaven keeping ethic conditioned logic given situations logic dhamma intended influence conduct categories people relation especially involved unequal relationships51 finally promotes ideals correspond first three steps buddhas graduated discourse53
interestingly ashokavadana presents alternate view familiar ashoka conversion nothing kalinga descent maurya dynasty instead ashokas reason adopting nonviolence appears much personal ashokavadana shows main source ashokas conversion acts welfare followed rooted instead intense personal anguish core wellspring inside rather spurred specific event thereby illuminates ashoka humanly ambitious passionate greatness flaws ashoka different shadowy dogooder later pali chronicles28
