floral parts
essential parts flower considered parts vegetative part consisting petals associated structures perianth reproductive sexual parts stereotypical flower consists four kinds structures attached short stalk kinds parts arranged whorl receptacle four main whorls starting base flower lowest node working upwards follows
perianth
main articles perianth sepal corolla flower
collectively calyx corolla form perianth diagram

calyx outermost whorl consisting units called sepals typically green enclose rest flower stage however absent prominent petallike species
corolla next whorl toward apex composed units called petals typically thin soft colored attract animals help process pollination

reproductive
main articles plant reproductive morphology androecium gynoecium




reproductive parts easter lily lilium longiflorum stigma style stamens filament petal



androecium greek andros oikia mans house next whorl sometimes multiplied several whorls consisting units called stamens stamens consist parts stalk called filament topped anther pollen produced meiosis eventually dispersed
gynoecium greek gynaikos oikia womans house innermost whorl flower consisting units called carpels carpel multiple fused carpels form hollow structure called ovary produces ovules internally ovules megasporangia turn produce megaspores meiosis develop female gametophytes give rise cells gynoecium flower also described using alternative terminology wherein structure sees innermost whorl consisting ovary style stigma called pistil pistil consist single carpel number carpels fused together sticky pistil stigma receptor pollen supportive stalk style becomes pathway pollen tubes grow pollen grains adhering stigma relationship gynoecium receptacle described hypogynous beneath superior ovary perigynous surrounding superior ovary epigynous inferior ovary

structure
although arrangement described considered typical plant species show wide variation floral structure1 modifications significance evolution flowering plants used extensively botanists establish relationships among plant species
four main parts flower generally defined positions receptacle function many flowers lack parts parts modified functions andor look like typically another part families like ranunculaceae petals greatly reduced many species sepals colorful petallike flowers modified stamens petallike double flowers peonies roses mostly petaloid stamens2 flowers show great variation plant scientists describe variation systematic identify distinguish species
specific terminology used describe flowers parts many flower parts fused together fused parts originating whorl connate fused parts originating different whorls adnate parts fused free petals fused tube ring falls away single unit sympetalous also called gamopetalous connate petals distinctive regions cylindrical base tube expanding region throat flaring outer region limb sympetalous flower bilateral symmetry upper lower bilabiate flowers connate petals sepals various shaped corolla calyx including campanulate funnelform tubular urceolate salverform rotate
referring fusion commonly done appears questionable least processes involved nonfusion processes example addition intercalary growth base primordia floral appendages sepals petals stamens carpels lead common base result fusion345

many flowers symmetry perianth bisected central axis point symmetrical halves produced flower said actinomorphic regular rose trillium example radial symmetry flowers bisected produce line produces symmetrical halves flower said irregular zygomorphic snapdragon orchids
flowers directly attached plant base sessile—the supporting stalk stem highly reduced absent stem stalk subtending flower called peduncle peduncle supports flower stems connecting flower main axis called pedicels apex flowering stem forms terminal swelling called torus receptacle
inflorescence




familiar calla lily single flower actually inflorescence tiny flowers pressed together central stalk surrounded large petallike bract


main article inflorescence
species flower axis collective cluster flowers termed inflorescence inflorescences composed many small flowers arranged formation resembles single flower common example members large composite asteraceae group single daisy sunflower example flower flower head—an inflorescence composed numerous flowers florets inflorescence include specialized stems modified leaves known bracts
floral diagrams floral formulae
main articles floral formula floral diagram
floral formula represent structure flower using specific letters numbers symbols presenting substantial information flower compact form represent taxon usually giving ranges numbers different organs particular species floral formulae developed early 19th century declined since prenner 2010 devised extension existing model broaden descriptive capability formula6 format floral formulae differs different parts world convey information78910
structure flower also expressed means floral diagrams schematic diagrams replace long descriptions complicated drawings tool understanding floral structure evolution diagrams show important features flowers including relative positions various organs including presence fusion symmetry well structural details7
development
flower develops modified shoot axis determinate apical meristem determinate meaning axis grows size compressed internodes bearing structures classical plant morphology interpreted highly modified leaves11 detailed developmental studies however shown stamens often initiated less like modified stems caulomes cases even resemble branchlets51 taking account whole diversity development androecium flowering plants find continuum modified leaves phyllomes modified stems caulomes modified branchlets shoots1213
flowering transition
transition flowering major phase changes plant makes life cycle transition must take place time favorable fertilization formation seeds hence ensuring maximal reproductive success meet needs plant able interpret important endogenous environmental cues changes levels plant hormones seasonable temperature photoperiod changes14 many perennial biennial plants require vernalization flower molecular interpretation signals transmission complex signal known florigen involves variety genes including constans flowering locus flowering locus florigen produced leaves reproductively favorable conditions acts buds growing tips induce number different physiological morphological changes15
first step transition transformation vegetative stem primordia floral primordia occurs biochemical changes take place change cellular differentiation leaf stem tissues tissue grow reproductive organs growth central part stem stops flattens sides develop protuberances whorled spiral fashion around outside stem protuberances develop sepals petals stamens carpels process begins plants cannot reversed stems develop flowers even initial start flower formation event dependent environmental cue16 process begins even removed stem continue develop flower

principal purpose flower reproduction individual species flowering plants heterosporous producing types spores microspores produced meiosis inside anthers megaspores produced inside ovules inside ovary fact anthers typically consist four microsporangia ovule integumented megasporangium types spores develop gametophytes inside sporangia heterosporous plants gametophytes also develop inside spores endosporic
majority species individual flowers functional carpels stamens botanists describe flowers perfect bisexual species hermaphroditic flowers lack reproductive organ called imperfect unisexual unisex flowers found individual plant different locations species said monoecious type unisex flower found separate individuals plant dioecious
flower specialization pollination
information pollination syndrome
flowering plants usually face selective pressure optimize transfer pollen typically reflected morphology flowers behaviour plants pollen transferred plants number vectors plants make abiotic vectors namely wind anemophily much less commonly water hydrophily others biotic vectors including insects entomophily birds ornithophily bats chiropterophily animals plants make multiple vectors many highly specialised
cleistogamous flowers selfpollinated open many viola salvia species known types flowers
flowers plants make biotic pollen vectors commonly glands called nectaries incentive animals visit flower flowers patterns called nectar guides show pollinators look nectar flowers also attract pollinators scent color still flowers mimicry attract pollinators species orchids example produce flowers resembling female bees color shape scent flowers also specialized shape arrangement stamens ensures pollen grains transferred bodies pollinator lands search attractant nectar pollen mate pursuing attractant many flowers species pollinator transfers pollen stigmas—arranged equally pointed precision—of flowers visits
anemophilous flowers wind move pollen flower next examples include grasses birch trees ragweed maples need attract pollinators therefore tend showy flowers male female reproductive organs generally found separate flowers male flowers number long filaments terminating exposed stamens female flowers long featherlike stigmas whereas pollen animalpollinated flowers tends largegrained sticky rich protein another reward pollinators anemophilous flower pollen usually smallgrained light little nutritional value animals
pollination
main article pollination




grains pollen sticking transferred next flower visits


primary purpose flower reproduction since flowers reproductive organs plant mediate joining sperm contained within pollen ovules contained ovary pollination movement pollen anthers stigma joining sperm ovules called fertilization normally pollen moved plant another many plants able self pollinate fertilized ovules produce seeds next generation sexual reproduction produces genetically unique offspring allowing adaptation flowers specific designs encourages transfer pollen plant another species many plants dependent upon external factors pollination including wind animals especially insects even large animals birds bats pygmy possums employed period time process take place flower fully expanded functional called anthesis study pollination insects called anthecology
pollination mechanism
pollination mechanism employed plant depends method pollination utilized
flowers divided broad groups pollination methods
entomophilous flowers attract insects bats birds animals transfer pollen flower next often specialized shape arrangement stamens ensures pollen grains transferred bodies pollinator lands search attractant nectar pollen mate pursuing attractant many flowers species pollinator transfers pollen stigmas—arranged equally pointed precision—of flowers visits many flowers rely simple proximity flower parts ensure pollination others sarracenia ladyslipper orchids elaborate designs ensure pollination preventing selfpollination




grass flower vestigial perianth lodicules


anemophilous flowers wind move pollen flower next examples include grasses birch trees ragweed maples need attract pollinators therefore tend grow large blossoms whereas pollen entomophilous flowers tends largegrained sticky rich protein another reward pollinators anemophilous flower pollen usually smallgrained light little nutritional value insects though still gathered times dearth honeybees bumblebees actively gather anemophilous corn maize pollen though little value
flowers stamens pistil capable selffertilization increase chance producing seeds limits genetic variation extreme case selffertilization occurs flowers always selffertilize many dandelions flowers selfpollinated flowers never open selfpollinated flowers open flowers called cleistogamous many viola species salvia types flowers conversely many species plants ways preventing selffertilization unisexual male female flowers plant appear mature time pollen plant incapable fertilizing ovules latter flower types chemical barriers pollen referred selfsterile selfincompatible
attraction methods




orchid evolved many generations better mimic female attract male bees pollinators


plants cannot move location another thus many flowers evolved attract animals transfer pollen individuals dispersed populations flowers insectpollinated called entomophilous literally insectloving greek highly modified along pollinating insects coevolution flowers commonly glands called nectaries various parts attract animals looking nutritious nectar birds bees color vision enabling seek colorful flowers
flowers patterns called nectar guides show pollinators look nectar visible ultraviolet light visible bees insects flowers also attract pollinators scent scents pleasant sense smell flower scents appealing humans number flowers pollinated insects attracted rotten flesh flowers smell like dead animals often called carrion flowers including rafflesia titan arum north american pawpaw asimina triloba flowers pollinated night visitors including bats moths likely concentrate scent attract pollinators flowers white
flowers mimicry attract pollinators species orchids example produce flowers resembling female bees color shape scent male bees move flower another search mate
flowerpollinator relationships
many flowers close relationships specific pollinating organisms many flowers example attract specific species insect therefore rely insect successful reproduction close relationship often given example coevolution flower pollinator thought developed together long period time match others needs
close relationship compounds negative effects extinction extinction either member relationship would mean almost certain extinction member well endangered plant species shrinking pollinator populations
pollen allergy
much confusion role flowers allergies example showy entomophilous goldenrod solidago frequently blamed respiratory allergies innocent since pollen cannot airborne types pollen commonly cause allergic reactions produced plainlooking plants trees grasses weeds showy flowers plants make small light pollen grains custommade wind transport
type allergens pollen main factor determines whether pollen likely cause fever example pine tree pollen produced large amounts common tree would make good candidate causing allergy however relatively rare cause allergy types allergens pine pollen appear make less allergenic instead allergen usually pollen contemporary bloom anemophilous ragweed ambrosia drift many miles scientists collected samples ragweed pollen miles miles high air17 single ragweed plant generate million grains pollen day18
among north american plants weeds prolific producers allergenic pollen19 ragweed major culprit important sources sagebrush redroot pigweed lambs quarters russian thistle tumbleweed english plantain
common hear people allergic colorful scented flowers like roses fact florists gardeners others prolonged close contact flowers likely sensitive pollen plants people little contact large heavy waxy pollen grains flowering plants type pollen carried wind insects butterflies bees

general assumption function flowers start involve animals reproduction process pollen scattered without bright colors obvious shapes would therefore liability using plants resources unless provide benefit proposed reason sudden fully developed appearance flowers evolved isolated setting like island chain islands plants bearing able develop highly specialized relationship specific animal wasp example many island species develop today symbiotic relationship hypothetical wasp bearing pollen plant another much wasps today could eventually resulted plants partners developing high degree specialization island genetics believed common source speciation especially comes radical adaptations seem required inferior transitional forms note wasp example incidental bees apparently evolved specifically symbiotic plant relationships descended wasps
likewise fruit used plant reproduction comes enlargement parts flower fruit frequently tool depends upon animals wishing thus scattering seeds contains
many symbiotic relationships remain fragile survive competition mainland organisms flowers proved unusually effective means production spreading whatever actual origin become dominant form land plant life
flower evolution continues present modern flowers profoundly influenced humans many cannot pollinated nature many modern domesticated flowers used simple weeds sprouted ground disturbed tended grow human crops prettiest plucked beauty developing dependence upon special adaptation human affection29
