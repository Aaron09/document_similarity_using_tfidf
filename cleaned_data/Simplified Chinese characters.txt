although simplified chinese characters today result works moderated government peoples republic china 1950s character simplification predates prcs formation 1949 cursive written text almost always includes character simplification simplified forms used print attested early dynasty 221–206




first batch simplified characters introduced 1935 consisted characters


earliest proponents character simplification lubi proposed 1909 simplified characters used education years following fourth movement 1919 many antiimperialist chinese intellectuals sought ways modernise china traditional culture values confucianism challenged soon people movement started cite traditional chinese writing system obstacle modernising china therefore proposed reform initiated suggested chinese writing system either simplified completely abolished sinian leader fourth movement called chinese characters writing oxdemons snakegods 牛鬼蛇神的文字 renowned chinese author 20th century stated chinese characters destroyed china 漢字不滅，中國必亡 recent commentators claimed chinese characters blamed economic problems china time14
1930s 1940s discussions character simplification took place within kuomintang government large number chinese intellectuals writers maintained character simplification would help boost literacy china15 1935 simplified characters collected qian xuantong officially introduced table first batch simplified characters suspended 1936
peoples republic chinaedit

within character simplification became associated leftists cultural revolution culminating secondround simplified characters promulgated 1977 part shock unease felt wake cultural revolution maos death secondround simplifications poorly receivedcitation needed 1986 authorities retracted second round completely later year authorities promulgated final list simplifications identical 1964 list except changes including restoration three characters simplified first round note form used instead regions using traditional chinese
simplification initiatives aimed eradicating characters entirely establishing hanyu pinyin romanization official written system reform never gained quite much popularity leftists hopedcitation needed retraction second round simplification stated wished keep chinese orthography stable years later 2009 chinese government released major revision list included 8300 characters simplifications introduced however characters previously listed traditional characters simplified well variant characters restored standard list addition orthographies stroke shape characters proposed modified slightly traditional calligraphic rules also practice unrestricted simplification rare archaic characters analogy using simplified radicals components discouraged state language commission official cited oversimplification reason restoring characters language authority declared open comment period august 2009 feedback public16 proposed orthographic changes characters implemented overwhelmingly negative public opinion17
officially promulgated version list commonly used standardized characters announced 2013 contained newly recognized standard characters previously considered variant forms well official approval characters simplified analogy seen wide explicitly given previous lists documents

method simplificationedit

structural simplification characters
characters simplified enumerated chart chart jianhuazi zong biao 简化字总表 complete list simplified characters announced 1986
chart lists characters used never serve simplified character components
chart lists characters used well utilized simplified character components derive simplified characters chart also lists components radicals cannot used generalized derivation complex characters
derivation based simplified character components
chart lists 1753 characters simplified based simplification principles used character components radicals chart list nonexhaustive character already found chart simplified accordance chart character simplified
elimination variants character
series organization list variant characters accounts orthography difference mainland china hand hong kong taiwan simplifications character structures rather reduction number total standard characters variant characters share identical pronunciation meaning character usually simplest form elevated standard character rest obsoleted rounds revisions 1993 1027 variant characters declared obsolete list amongst chosen variants appear complete list simplified characters also simplified character structure accordingly
adoption standardized character forms
standardized character forms originated list character forms general used chinese characters publishing containing 6196 characters published 1965 forms tend adopt vulgar variant forms characters list commonly used characters modern chinese list published 1988 contains 7000 commonly used characters replaces 1965 list since forms take vulgar variants many characters appear slightly simpler compared forms often mistaken structurally simplified characters

adoption standardized character formsedit
standardized character forms started list character forms general used chinese characters publishing revised list commonly used characters modern chinese tend adopt vulgar variant character forms since forms take vulgar variants many characters appear slightly simpler compared forms often mistaken structurally simplified characters examples follow

consistencyedit
common misconception simplification process arbitrary based consistent rules allegations often made people discover principles simplification anecdotal evidence5 note however simplification derivation must follow rules mentioned earlier
often cited example apparent irregularity simplification involves characters appear share simple symbol used many simplified characters chart often intuited character component observing student simplification infer simplification mechanism also works observing simplified simplified come conclusion process simplification irregular
however complete list simplified characters appears chart listed chart derived character found nonexhaustive list chart therefore defined simplified character component according standard based simplified
series organization list variant characters variant character replaced character simplified chart therefore
appear chart thus defined derived characters
characters components found chart usable derivation investigation reveals characters appear chart series organization list variant characters thus defined simplified characters remain unchanged traditional forms list commonly used characters modern chinese
character forms result simpler characters fewer strokes instance form strokes appears strokes form however technically character forms constitute simplified characters
