usesedit
soil used agriculture serves anchor primary nutrient base plants however demonstrated hydroponics essential plant growth soilcontained nutrients dissolved solution types soil available moisture determine species plants cultivated
soil material also critical component mining construction landscape development industries365 soil serves foundation construction projects movement massive volumes soil involved surface mining road building construction earth sheltering architectural practice using soil external thermal mass building walls many building materials soil based
soil resources critical environment well food fibre production soil provides minerals water plants soil absorbs rainwater releases later thus preventing floods drought soil cleans water percolates soil habitat many organisms major part known unknown biodiversity soil form invertebrates earthworms woodlice millipedes centipedes snails slugs mites springtails enchytraeids nematodes protists bacteria archaea fungi algae organisms living ground part plants spend part life cycle insects belowground aboveground belowground biodiversities tightly interconnected366367 making soil protection paramount importance restoration conservation plan
biological component soil extremely important carbon sink since biotic content carbon even desert crusts cyanobacteria lichens mosses capture sequester significant amount carbon photosynthesis poor farming grazing methods degraded soils released much sequestered carbon atmosphere restoring worlds soils could offset huge increase greenhouse gases causing global warming improving crop yields reducing water needs368369370
waste management often soil component septic drain fields treat septic tank effluent using aerobic soil processes landfills soil daily cover land application waste water relies soil biology aerobically treat
organic soils especially peat serve significant fuel resource wide areas peat production sphagnum bogs protected patrimonial interest
geophagy practice eating soillike substances animals human cultures occasionally consume soil medicinal recreational religious purposes shown monkeys consume soil together preferred food tree foliage fruits order alleviate tannin toxicity371

soil acidification beneficial case alkaline soils degrades land lowers crop productivity increases soil vulnerability contamination erosion soils often initially acid parent materials acid initially basic cations calcium magnesium potassium sodium acidification occurs elements leached soil profile rainfall harvesting forest agricultural crops soil acidification accelerated acidforming nitrogenous fertilizers effects acid precipitation
soil contamination levels often within soils capacity treat assimilate waste material soil biota treat waste transforming soil colloids adsorb waste material many waste treatment processes rely treatment capacity exceeding treatment capacity damage soil biota limit soil function derelict soils occur industrial contamination development activity damages soil degree land cannot used safely productively remediation derelict soil uses principles geology physics chemistry biology degrade attenuate isolate remove soil contaminants restore soil functions values techniques include leaching sparging chemical amendments phytoremediation bioremediation natural degradation
desertification environmental process ecosystem degradation arid semiarid regions often caused human activity common misconception droughts cause desertification droughts common arid semiarid lands wellmanaged lands recover drought rains return soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient organic matter levels reduced tillage increased cover practices help control erosion maintain productivity periods moisture available continued land abuse droughts however increases land degradation increased population livestock pressure marginal lands accelerates desertification
erosion soil caused water wind movement response gravity kind erosion occur simultaneously erosion distinguished weathering since erosion also transports eroded soil away place origin soil transit described sediment erosion intrinsic natural process many places greatly increased human activity especially poor land practices include agricultural activities leave soil bare times heavy rain strong winds overgrazing deforestation improper construction activity improved management limit erosion soil conservation techniques employed include changes land replacing erosionprone crops grass soilbinding plants changes timing type agricultural operations terrace building erosionsuppressing cover materials including cover crops plants limiting disturbance construction avoiding construction erosionprone periods
serious longrunning water erosion problem occurs china middle reaches yellow river upper reaches yangtze river yellow river billion tons sediment flow year ocean sediment originates primarily water erosion gully erosion loess plateau region northwest china
soil piping particular form soil erosion occurs soil surface causes levee failure well sink hole formation turbulent flow removes soil starting mouth seep flow subsoil erosion advances upgradient377 term sand boil used describe appearance discharging active soil pipe378
soil salination accumulation free salts extent leads degradation agricultural value soils vegetation consequences include corrosion damage reduced plant growth erosion loss plant cover soil structure water quality problems sedimentation salination occurs combination natural humancaused processes arid conditions favour salt accumulation especially apparent soil parent material saline irrigation arid lands especially problematic379 irrigation water level salinity irrigation especially involves leakage canals overirrigation field often raises underlying water table rapid salination occurs land surface within capillary fringe saline groundwater soil salinity control involves watertable control flushing higher levels applied water combination tile drainage another form subsurface drainage380381

soils contain high levels particular clays smectites often fertile example smectiterich clays thailands central plains among productive world
many farmers tropical areas however struggle retain organic matter soils work recent years example productivity declined lowclay soils northern thailand farmers initially responded adding organic matter termite mounds unsustainable longterm scientists experimented adding bentonite smectite family clays soil field trials conducted scientists international water management institute cooperation khon kaen university local farmers effect helping retain water nutrients supplementing farmers usual practice single application bentonite hectare resulted average yield increase work showed applying bentonite degraded sandy soils reduced risk crop failure drought years
2008 three years initial trials iwmi scientists conducted survey among farmers northeast thailand half applied bentonite fields average improvement using clay addition higher nonclay users using clay enabled farmers switch growing vegetables need fertile soil helped increase income researchers estimated farmers northeast thailand cambodia adopted clays 20000 farmers introduced technique382
