suns apparent motionedit

earth takes year orbit apparent position takes year make complete circuit ecliptic slightly days year moves little less eastward3 every small difference suns position stars causes particular spot earths surface catch stand directly north south four minutes later would earth would orbit earth therefore hours long rather approximately 23hour 56minute sidereal simplification based hypothetical earth orbits uniform speed around actual speed earth orbits varies slightly year speed seems move along ecliptic also varies example north celestial equator days year south days4 variation orbital speed accounts part equation time5
