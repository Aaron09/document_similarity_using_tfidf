biodiversity hotspots chiefly tropical regions feature high concentrations endemic species hotspots combined contain half world’s terrestrial species9 hotspots suffering habitat loss destruction natural habitat islands areas high human population density already destroyed 2003 islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include zealand madagascar philippines japan10 south east asia especially china india malaysia indonesia japan many areas west africa extremely dense human populations allow little room natural habitat marine areas close highly populated coastal cities also face degradation coral reefs marine habitat areas include eastern coasts asia africa northern coasts south america caribbean associated islands10

abovementioned activities proximal direct causes habitat destruction actually destroy habitat still identify humans destroy habitat forces cause humans destroy habitat known drivers habitat destruction demographic economic sociopolitical scientific technological cultural drivers contribute habitat destruction18
demographic drivers include expanding human population rate population increase time spatial distribution people given area urban versus rural ecosystem type country combined effects poverty family planning gender education status people certain areas18 exponential human population growth worldwide occurring close biodiversity hotspots9 explain human population density accounts variation numbers threatened species across countries providing indisputable evidence people play largest role decreasing biodiversity23 boom human population migration people speciesrich regions making conservation efforts urgent also likely conflict local human interests9 high local population density areas directly correlated poverty status local people lacking education family planning19
geist lambin 2002 study described previous section underlying driving forces prioritized follows percent cases factor played significant role economic factors institutional policy factors technological factors cultural sociopolitical factors demographic factors main economic factors included commercialization growth timber markets driven national international demands urban industrial growth domestic costs land labor fuel timber increases product prices mainly cash crops institutional policy factors included formal prodeforestation policies land development economic growth including colonization infrastructure improvement subsidies landbased activities property rights landtenure insecurity policy failures corruption lawlessness mismanagement main technological factor poor application technology wood industry leads wasteful logging practices within broad category cultural sociopolitical factors public attitudes values individualhousehold behavior public unconcern toward forest environments missing basic values unconcern individuals demographic factors inmigration colonizing settlers sparsely populated forest areas growing population density result first factor areas

habitat destruction vastly increases areas vulnerability natural disasters like flood drought crop failure spread disease water contamination18 hand healthy ecosystem good management practices reduce chance events happening least mitigate adverse impacts
agricultural land actually suffer destruction surrounding landscape past years destruction habitat surrounding agricultural land degraded approximately agricultural land worldwide erosion salinization compaction nutrient depletion pollution urbanization18 humans also lose direct uses natural habitat habitat destroyed aesthetic uses birdwatching recreational uses like hunting fishing ecotourism usually rely upon virtually undisturbed habitat many people value complexity natural world disturbed loss natural habitats animal plant species worldwide
probably profound impact habitat destruction people loss many valuable ecosystem services habitat destruction altered nitrogen phosphorus sulfur carbon cycles increased frequency severity acid rain algal blooms fish kills rivers oceans contributed tremendously global climate change18 ecosystem service whose significance becoming realized climate regulation local scale trees provide windbreaks shade regional scale plant transpiration recycles rainwater maintains constant annual rainfall global scale plants especially trees tropical rainforests around world counter accumulation greenhouse gases atmosphere sequestering carbon dioxide photosynthesis10 ecosystem services diminished lost altogether result habitat destruction include watershed management nitrogen fixation oxygen production pollination pollinator decline25 waste treatment breaking immobilization toxic pollutants nutrient recycling sewage agricultural runoff10
loss trees tropical rainforests alone represents substantial diminishing earth’s ability produce oxygen carbon dioxide services becoming even important increasing carbon dioxide levels main contributors global climate change
loss biodiversity directly affect humans indirect effects losing many species well diversity ecosystems general enormous biodiversity lost environment loses many species provide valuable unique roles ecosystem environment inhabitants rely biodiversity recover extreme environmental conditions much biodiversity lost catastrophic event earthquake flood volcanic eruption could cause ecosystem crash humans would obviously suffer loss biodiversity also means humans losing animals could served biological control agents plants could potentially provide higheryielding crop varieties pharmaceutical drugs cure existing future diseases cancer resistant crop varieties agricultural species susceptible pesticideresistant insects virulent strains fungi viruses bacteria10
negative effects habitat destruction usually impact rural populations directly urban populations18 across globe poor people suffer natural habitat destroyed less natural habitat means less natural resources capita wealthier people countries simply continue receive capita share natural resources
another view negative effects habitat destruction look opportunity cost keeping area undisturbed words people losing taking away given habitat country increase food supply converting forest land rowcrop agriculture value land much larger supply natural resources services clean water timber ecotourism flood regulation drought control18
outlookedit
rapid expansion global human population increasing world’s food requirement substantially simple logic instructs people require food fact world’s population increases dramatically agricultural output need increase least next years26 past continually moving land soils provided boost food production appease global food demand easy longer available however land suitable agriculture already degraded beyond repair27
impending global food crisis major source habitat destruction commercial farmers going become desperate produce food amount land fertilizers less concern environment meet market demand others seek land convert landuses agriculture agricultural intensification become widespread cost environment inhabitants species pushed habitat either directly habitat destruction indirectly fragmentation degradation pollution efforts protect world’s remaining natural habitat biodiversity compete directly humans’ growing demand natural resources especially agricultural lands26

cases tropical deforestation three four underlying causes driving three proximate causes19 means universal policy controlling tropical deforestation would able address unique combination proximate underlying causes deforestation country19 local national international deforestation policies written enforced governmental leaders must acquire detailed understanding complex combination proximate causes underlying driving forces deforestation given area country19 concept along many results tropical deforestation geist lambin study easily applied habitat destruction general governmental leaders need take action addressing underlying driving forces rather merely regulating proximate causes broader sense governmental bodies local national international scale need emphasize following

considering many irreplaceable ecosystem services provided natural habitats
protecting remaining intact sections natural habitat
educating public importance natural habitat biodiversity
developing family planning programs areas rapid population growth
finding ecological ways increase agricultural output without increasing total land production
preserving habitat corridors minimize prior damage fragmented habitats
reduce human population expansion
