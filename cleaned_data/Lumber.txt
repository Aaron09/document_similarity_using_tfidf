defects occurring lumber grouped following four divisions

process converting timber commercial form following defects occur

chip mark defect indicated marks signs placed chips finished surface timber
diagonal grain improper sawing timber
torn grain small depression made finished surface falling tool
wane presence original rounded surface finished product

defects fungiedit

termites
carpenter ants
carpenter bees

natural forcesedit
main article wood warping
main natural forces responsible causing defects timber abnormal growth rupture tissues rupture tissue includes cracks splits wood called shakes ring shake wind shake ring failure wood grain separates around growth rings either standing felling shakes reduce strength timber appearance thus reduce lumber grade capture moisture promoting decay eastern hemlock known ring shake23 check crack surface wood caused outside timber shrinking seasons checks extend pith follow grain like shakes checks hold water promoting split goes timber checks splits occur frequently ends lumber rapid drying locations23
seasoningedit
seasoning lumber typically either kiln airdried defects seasoning main cause splinters sliverscitation needed
durability service lifeedit
proper conditions wood provides excellent lasting performance however also faces several potential threats service life including fungal activity insect damage avoided numerous ways section 230411 international building code addresses protection decay termites section provides requirements nonresidential construction applications wood used ground framing decks stairs well applications
four recommended methods protect woodframe structures durability hazards thus provide maximum service life building require proper design construction

controlling moisture using design techniques avoid decay
providing effective control termites insects
using durable materials pressure treated naturally durable species wood appropriate
providing quality assurance design construction throughout building’s service life using appropriate maintenance practices

moisture controledit
wood hygroscopic material means naturally absorbs releases water balance internal moisture content surrounding environment moisture content wood measured weight water percentage ovendry weight wood fiber controlling decay controlling moisture decay fungi established minimum moisture content decay propagate percent building experts recommend percent maximum safe moisture content untreated wood service water harm wood rather wood consistently high moisture content enables fungal organisms grow
primary objective addressing moisture loads keep water entering building envelope first place balance moisture content within building moisture control means accepted design construction details simple practical method protecting woodframe building decay applications high risk staying designers specify durable materials naturally decayresistant species wood treated preservatives cladding shingles sill plates exposed timbers glulam beams examples potential applications treated wood
controlling termites insectsedit
buildings termite zones basic protection practices addressed current building codes include limited following
grading building site away foundation provide proper drainage
covering exposed ground crawl spaces 6mil polyethylene film maintaining least inches clearance ground bottom framing members inches beams girders inches joists plank flooring members
supporting post columns concrete piers least inches clear space wood exposed earth
installing wood framing sheathing exterior walls least eight inches exposed earth locating siding least inches finished grade
appropriate ventilating crawl spaces according local building codes
removing building material scraps site backfilling
allowed local regulation treating soil around foundation approved termiticide provide protection subterranean termites
preservativesedit
main article wood preservation




special fasteners used treated lumber corrosive chemicals used preservation process


avoid decay termite infestation untreated wood separated ground sources moisture separations required many building codes considered necessary maintain wood elements permanent structures safe moisture content decay protection possible separate wood sources moisture designers often rely preservativetreated wood24
wood treated preservative improves service life severe conditions without altering basic characteristics also pressureimpregnated fireretardant chemicals improve performance fire25 early treatments fireproof lumber retard fires developed 1936 protexol corporation lumber heavily treated salt26 wood deteriorate simply gets wood breaks organism eating preservatives work making food source inedible organisms properly preservativetreated wood times service life untreated wood preserved wood used often railroad ties utility poles marine piles decks fences outdoor applications various treatment methods types chemicals available depending attributes required particular application level protection needed27
basic methods treating without pressure nonpressure methods application preservative brushing spraying dipping piece treated deeper thorough penetration achieved driving preservative wood cells pressure various combinations pressure vacuum used force adequate levels chemical wood pressuretreating preservatives consist chemicals carried solvent chromated copper arsenate commonly used wood preservative north america began phased residential applications 2004 replacing amine copper quat copper azole
wood preservatives used united states canada registered regularly reexamined safety environmental protection agency health canadas pest management regulatory agency respectively27

timber framingedit
main article timber framing
timber framing style construction uses heavier framing elements modern stick framing uses dimensional lumber timbers originally tree boles squared broadaxe adze joined together joinery without nails modern timber framing growing popularity united states since 1970s29
environmental effects lumberedit
green building minimizes impact environmental footprint building wood major building material renewable replenishable continuous cycle27 studies show manufacturing wood uses less energy results less water pollution steel concrete30 however demand lumber blamed deforestation31
