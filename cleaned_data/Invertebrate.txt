etymology
word invertebrate comes form latin word vertebra means joint general sometimes specifically joint spinal column vertebrate turn jointed aspect vertebra derived concept turning expressed root verto vorto turn3 coupled prefix meaning without4
taxonomic significance
term invertebrates always precise among nonbiologists since accurately describe taxon arthropoda vertebrata manidae terms describes valid taxon phylum subphylum family invertebrata term convenience taxon little circumscriptional significance except within chordata vertebrata subphylum comprises small proportion metazoa speak kingdom animalia terms vertebrata invertebrata limited practicality formal taxonomy animalia attributes logically precede presence absence vertebral column constructing cladogram example presence notochord would least circumscribe chordata however even notochord would less fundamental criterion aspects embryological development symmetry5 perhaps bauplan6
despite concept invertebrates taxon animals persisted century among laity7 within zoological community literature remains term convenience animals members vertebrata8 following text reflects earlier scientific understanding term animals constituted according understanding invertebrates possess skeleton bone either internal external include hugely varied body plans many fluidfilled hydrostatic skeletons like jellyfish worms others hard exoskeletons outer shells like insects crustaceans familiar invertebrates include protozoa porifera coelenterata platyhelminthes nematoda annelida echinodermata mollusca arthropoda arthropoda include insects crustaceans arachnids

characteristics
trait common invertebrates absence vertebral column backbone creates distinction invertebrates vertebrates distinction convenience based clear biologically homologous trait common trait wings functionally unites insects bats birds wings unites tortoises snails sponges animals invertebrates heterotrophs require sustenance form consumption organisms exceptions porifera invertebrates generally bodies composed differentiated tissues also typically digestive chamber openings exterior
morphology symmetry
body plans multicellular organisms exhibit form symmetry whether radial bilateral spherical minority however exhibit symmetry example asymmetric invertebrates include gastropod species easily seen snails snails helical shells slugs appear externally symmetrical pneumostome breathing hole located right side gastropods develop external asymmetry glaucus atlanticus develops asymmetrical cerata mature origin gastropod asymmetry subject scientific debate10
examples asymmetry found fiddler crabs hermit crabs often claw much larger male fiddler loses large claw grow another opposite side moulting sessile animals sponges asymmetrical11 alongside coral colonies exception individual polyps exhibit radial symmetry alpheidae claws lack pincers copepods polyopisthocotyleans monogeneans parasitize attachment residency within gill chamber fish hosts
nervous system
neurons differ invertebrates mammalian cells invertebrates cells fire response similar stimuli mammals tissue trauma high temperature changes first invertebrate neuron cell identified medicinal leech hirudo medicinalis1213
learning memory using nociceptors hare aplysia described141516 mollusk neurons able detect increasing pressures tissue trauma17
neurons identified wide range invertebrate species including annelids molluscs nematodes arthropods1819
respiratory system




tracheal system dissected cockroach largest tracheae across width body cockroach horizontal image scale






tracheal system branches progressively smaller tubes supplying crop cockroach scale


type invertebrate respiriatory system open respiratory system composed spiracles tracheae tracheoles terrestrial arthropods transport metabolic gases tissues20 distribution spiracles vary greatly among many orders insects general segment body pair spiracles connects atrium relatively large tracheal tube behind tracheae invaginations cuticular exoskeleton branch anastomose throughout body diameters micrometres smallest tubes tracheoles penetrate cells serve sites diffusion water oxygen carbon dioxide conducted respiratory system means active ventilation passive diffusion unlike vertebrates insects generally carry oxygen haemolymph21
tracheal tube contain ridgelike circumferential rings taenidia various geometries loops helices head thorax abdomen tracheae also connected sacs many insects grasshoppers bees actively pump sacs abdomen able control flow body aquatic insects tracheae exchange body wall directly form gill function essentially normal plastron note despite internal tracheae arthropods shed moulting ecdysiscitation needed
reproduction
like vertebrates invertebrates reproduce least partly sexual reproduction produce specialized reproductive cells undergo meiosis produce smaller motile spermatozoa larger nonmotile ova22 fuse form zygotes develop individuals23 others capable asexual reproduction sometimes methods reproduction
social interaction
social behavior widespread invertebrates including cockroaches termites aphids thrips ants bees passalidae acari spiders more24 social interaction particularly salient eusocial species applies invertebrates well
insects recognize information transmitted insects252627
phyla




fossil coral cladocora pliocene cyprus


term invertebrates covers several phyla sponges porifera long thought diverged animals early28 lack complex organization found phyla29 cells differentiated cases organized distinct tissues30 sponges typically feed drawing water pores31 speculate sponges primitive instead secondarily simplified32 ctenophora cnidaria includes anemones corals jellyfish radially symmetric digestive chambers single opening serves mouth anus33 distinct tissues organized organs34 main germ layers ectoderm endoderm scattered cells sometimes called diploblastic35
echinodermata radially symmetric exclusively marine including starfish asteroidea urchins echinoidea brittle stars ophiuroidea cucumbers holothuroidea feather stars crinoidea36
largest animal phylum also included within invertebrates arthropoda including insects spiders crabs organisms body divided repeating segments typically paired appendages addition possess hardened exoskeleton periodically shed growth37 smaller phyla onychophora tardigrada close relatives arthropods share traits nematoda roundworms perhaps second largest animal phylum also invertebrates roundworms typically microscopic occur nearly every environment water38 number important parasites39 smaller phyla related kinorhyncha priapulida loricifera groups reduced coelom called pseudocoelom invertebrates include nemertea ribbon worms sipuncula
another phylum platyhelminthes flatworms40 originally considered primitive appears developed complex ancestors41 flatworms acoelomates lacking body cavity closest relatives microscopic gastrotricha42 rotifera rotifers common aqueous environments invertebrates also include acanthocephala spinyheaded worms gnathostomulida micrognathozoa cycliophora43
also included successful animal phyla mollusca annelida4445 former secondlargest animal phylum number described species includes animals snails clams squids latter comprises segmented worms earthworms leeches groups long considered close relatives common presence trochophore larvae annelids considered closer arthropods segmented46 generally considered convergent evolution owing many morphological genetic differences phyla47
among lesser phyla invertebrates hemichordata acorn worms48 chaetognatha arrow worms phyla include acoelomorpha brachiopoda bryozoa entoprocta phoronida xenoturbellida
