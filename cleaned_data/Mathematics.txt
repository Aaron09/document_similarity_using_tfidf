etymology
word mathematics comes greek μάθημα máthēma ancient greek language means learnt22 gets know hence also study science modern greek lesson word máthēma derived μανθάνω manthano modern greek equivalent μαθαίνω mathaino mean learn greece word mathematics came narrower technical meaning mathematical study even classical times23 adjective μαθηματικός mathēmatikós meaning related learning studious likewise came mean mathematical particular μαθηματικὴ τέχνη mathēmatikḗ tékhnē latin mathematica meant mathematical
similarly main schools thought pythagoreanism known mathēmatikoi μαθηματικοί time meant teachers rather mathematicians modern sense
latin english around 1700 term mathematics commonly meant astrology sometimes astronomy rather mathematics meaning gradually changed present 1500 1800 resulted several mistranslations particularly notorious saint augustines warning christians beware mathematici meaning astrologers sometimes mistranslated condemnation mathematicians24
apparent plural form english like french plural form mathématiques less commonly used singular derivative mathématique goes back latin neuter plural mathematica cicero based greek plural μαθηματικά mathēmatiká used aristotle 384–322 meaning roughly things mathematical although plausible english borrowed adjective mathematical formed noun mathematics anew pattern physics metaphysics inherited greek25 english noun mathematics takes singular verb forms often shortened maths englishspeaking north america math26

three leading types definition mathematics called logicist intuitionist formalist reflecting different philosophical school thought29 severe problems none widespread acceptance reconciliation seems possible29

intuitionist definitions developing philosophy mathematician brouwer identify mathematics certain mental phenomena example intuitionist definition mathematics mental activity consists carrying constructs other29 peculiarity intuitionism rejects mathematical ideas considered valid according definitions particular philosophies mathematics allow objects proved exist even though cannot constructed intuitionism allows mathematical objects actually construct

carl friedrich gauss known prince mathematicians


german mathematician carl friedrich gauss referred mathematics queen sciences12 recently marcus sautoy called mathematics queen science main driving force behind scientific discovery33 original latin regina scientiarum well german königin wissenschaften word corresponding science means field knowledge original meaning science english also mathematics sense field knowledge specialization restricting meaning science natural science follows rise baconian science contrasted natural science scholasticism aristotelean method inquiring first principles role empirical experimentation observation negligible mathematics compared natural sciences biology chemistry physics albert einstein stated laws mathematics refer reality certain certain refer reality15
many philosophers believe mathematics experimentally falsifiable thus science according definition karl popper34 however 1930s gödels incompleteness theorems convinced many mathematicianswho mathematics cannot reduced logic alone karl popper concluded mathematical theories like physics biology hypotheticodeductive pure mathematics therefore turns much closer natural sciences whose hypotheses conjectures seemed even recently35 thinkers notably imre lakatos applied version falsificationism mathematics itselfcitation needed

leonhard euler created popularized much mathematical notation used today


mathematical notation today invented 16th century42 mathematics written words limiting mathematical discovery43 euler 1707–1783 responsible many notations today modern notation makes mathematics much easier professional beginners often find daunting according barbara oakley attributed fact mathematical ideas abstract encrypted natural language44 unlike natural language people often equate word physical object corresponds mathematical symbols abstract lacking physical analog45 mathematical symbols also highly encrypted regular words meaning single symbol encode number different operations ideas46
moreover mathematical language difficult understand beginners common terms precise meanings everyday speech common terms open field refer specific mathematical ideas related usual meanings mathematical language also includes many technical terms homeomorphism integrable meaning outside mathematics additionally shorthand phrases belong mathematical jargon reason special notation technical vocabulary mathematics requires precision everyday speech mathematicians refer precision language logic rigor
mathematical proof fundamentally matter rigor mathematicians want theorems follow axioms means systematic reasoning avoid mistaken theorems based fallible intuitions many instances occurred history subjectb level rigor expected mathematics varied time greeks expected detailed arguments time isaac newton methods employed less rigorous problems inherent definitions used newton would lead resurgence careful analysis formal proof 19th century misunderstanding rigor cause common misconceptions mathematics today mathematicians continue argue among computerassisted proofs since large computations hard verify proofs sufficiently rigorous47
axioms traditional thought selfevident truths conception problematic48 formal level axiom string symbols intrinsic meaning context derivable formulas axiomatic system goal hilberts program mathematics firm axiomatic basis according gödels incompleteness theorem every sufficiently powerful axiomatic system undecidable formulas final axiomatization mathematics impossible nonetheless mathematics often imagined formal content nothing theory axiomatization sense every mathematical statement proof could cast formulas within theory49
