honorificsedit
talking someone superior status speaker writer usually uses special nouns verb endings indicate subjects superiority generally someone superior status heshe older relative stranger roughly equal greater employer teacher customer like someone equal inferior status heshe younger stranger student employee like nowadays special endings used declarative interrogative imperative sentences honorific normal sentences
honorifics traditional korea strictly hierarchical caste estate systems possessed patterns usages much complex stratified used today intricate structure korean honorific system flourished traditional culture society honorifics contemporary korea used people psychologically distant honorifics also used people superior status example older relatives people older teachers employers34

seven verb paradigms speech levels korean level unique verb endings used indicate level formality situation35 unlike honorifics—which used show respect towards referent person spoken —speech levels used show respect towards speakers writers audience person spoken names seven levels derived nonhonorific imperative form verb hada level plus suffix hanja means style
highest levels generally grouped together jondaenmal whereas lowest level haeche called banmal korean
nowadays youngergeneration speakers longer feel obligated lower usual regard toward referent common younger people talk older relatives banmal disrespect instead shows intimacy closeness relationship speakers transformations social structures attitudes todays rapidly changing society brought change people speak34

however still find stronger contrasts sexes within korean speech examples seen softer tone used women speech married woman introducing someone’s mother wife name presence gender differences titles occupational terms example sajang company president yŏsajang female company president females sometimes using questions rising tones statements also seen speech children36
western societies individuals tend avoid expressions power asymmetry mutually addressing first names sake solidarity 37citation needed people asymmetrical status korean society people tend emphasize differences status sake solidarity koreans prefer kinship terms rather terms reference38 traditional korean society women long disadvantaged positions korean social structure traditionally patriarchically dominated family system emphasized maintenance family lines structure tended separate roles women men39
