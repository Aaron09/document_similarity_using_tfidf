arthropods spiders cuticles would block information outside world except penetrated many sensors connections sensors nervous system fact spiders arthropods modified cuticles elaborate arrays sensors various touch sensors mostly bristles called setae respond different levels force strong contact weak currents chemical sensors provide equivalents taste smell often means setae19 pedipalps carry large number setae sensitive contact chemicals airborne smells female pheromones23 spiders also joints limbs slit sensillae detects force vibrations webbuilding spiders mechanical chemical sensors important eyes eyes important spiders hunt actively8

methods capturing prey

phonognatha graeffei leafcurling spiders serves trap making home leaf


bestknown method prey capture means sticky webs varying placement webs allows different species spider trap different insects area example flat horizontal webs trap insects vegetation underneath flat vertical webs trap insects horizontal flight webbuilding spiders poor vision extremely sensitive vibrations8
females water spider argyroneta aquatica build underwater diving bell webs fill digesting prey molting mating raising offspring live almost entirely within bells darting catch prey animals touch bell threads anchor it41 spiders surfaces lakes ponds webs detecting trapped insects vibrations cause struggling8
netcasting spiders weave small webs manipulate trap prey genus hyptiotes family theridiosomatidae stretch webs release prey strike actively move webs family deinopidae weave even smaller webs hold outstretched first pairs legs lunge push webs much twice body length trap prey move increase webs area factor experiments shown deinopis spinosus different techniques trapping prey backwards strikes catch flying insects whose vibrations detects forward strikes catch groundwalking prey sees techniques also observed deinopids walking insects form prey deinopids population deinopis subrufa appears live mainly tipulid flies catch backwards strike42

webs




nephila clavata golden weaver


half potential prey webs escape perform three functions intercepting prey intersection absorbing momentum without breaking stopping trapping prey entangling sticking retention single design best prey example wider spacing lines increase webs area hence ability intercept prey reduce stopping power retention closer spacing larger sticky droplets thicker lines would improve retention would make easier potential prey avoid least however consistent differences webs built built night fact simple relationship design features prey capture orbweaving species takes wide range prey58
hubs webs spiders lurk usually center spiders move downwards faster upwards obvious direction spider retreat avoid predators usually offset towards direction58
horizontal webs fairly common despite less effective intercepting retaining prey vulnerable damage rain falling debris various researchers suggested horizontal webs offer compensating advantages reduced vulnerability wind damage reduced visibility prey flying upwards backlighting enabling oscillations catch insects slow horizontal flight however single explanation common horizontal webs58
spiders often attach highly visible silk bands called decorations stabilimenta webs field research suggests webs decorative bands captured prey hour60 however laboratory study showed spiders reduce building decorations sense presence predators61
