midstream operations sometimes classified within downstream sector operations compose separate discrete sector petroleum industry midstream operations processes include following

gathering gathering process employs narrow lowpressure pipelines connect gasproducing wells larger longhaul pipelines processing facilities24
processingrefining processing refining operations turn crude marketable products case crude products include heating gasoline vehicles fuel diesel oil25 refining processes include distillation vacuum distillation catalytic reforming catalytic cracking alkylation isomerization hydrotreating25 natural processing includes compression glycol dehydration amine treating separating product pipelinequality natural stream mixed natural liquids fractionation separates stream mixed natural liquids components fractionation process yields ethane propane butane isobutane natural gasoline
transportation transported processing facilities users pipeline tankerbarge truck rail pipelines economical transportation method suited movement across longer distances example across continents26 tankers barges also employed longdistance often international transport rail truck also used longer distances costeffective shorter routes
storage midstream service providers provide storage facilities terminals throughout distribution systems facilities often located near refining processing facilities connected pipeline systems facilitate shipment product demand must petroleum products held storage tanks natural tends stored underground facilities salt dome caverns depleted reservoirs
technological applications midstream service providers apply technological solutions improve efficiency midstream processes technology used compression fuels ease flow pipelines better detect leaks pipelines automate communications better pipeline equipment monitoring

future shortagesedit
petroleum nonrenewable natural resource industry faced inevitable eventual depletion worlds supply statistical review world energy 2007 listed reserveproduction ratio proven resources worldwide study placed ratio proven reserves production middle east years latin america years north america years simplistic interpretation ratio many false predictions immanent running since early years industry 1800s especially true united states ratio proved reservestoproduction years years since 1920 many mistakenly interpreted result number years supply exhausted analyses take account future reserves growth30
hubbert peak theory introduced concept peak questions sustainability production suggests peak production rates period depletion ensue since virtually economic sectors rely heavily petroleum peak could lead partial complete failure markets31
according research ibis world biofuels primarily ethanol also biodiesel continue supplement petroleum however output levels fuels displace local production ethanol used blended gasoline produce ethanol lifting oxygen content fuel32
