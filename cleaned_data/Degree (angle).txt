original motivation choosing degree unit rotations angles unknown theory states related fact approximately number days year5 ancient astronomers noticed follows ecliptic path course year seems advance path approximately degree ancient calendars persian calendar used days year calendar days related sexagesimal numbers
another theory babylonians subdivided circle using angle equilateral triangle basic unit subdivided latter parts following sexagesimal numeric system67 earliest trigonometry used babylonian astronomers greek successors based chords circle chord length equal radius made natural base quantity sixtieth using standard sexagesimal divisions degree
aristarchus samos hipparchus seem among first greek scientists exploit babylonian astronomical knowledge techniques systematically89 timocharis aristarchus aristillus archimedes hipparchus first greeks known divide circle degrees minutes10 eratosthenes used simpler sexagesimal system dividing circle parts
division circle parts also occurred ancient india evidenced rigveda11

another motivation choosing number readily divisible divisorsnote making numbers number less twice much divisors sequence a072938 oeis1213 furthermore divisible every number except 7note property many useful applications dividing world time zones nominally longitude correlate established 24hour convention
finally case factors come play according theory number approximately apparent movement celestial sphere rounded mathematical reasons cited
subdivisionsedit
many practical purposes degree small enough angle whole degrees provide sufficient precision case astronomy geographic coordinates latitude longitude degree measurements written using decimal degrees degree symbol behind decimals example 401875°
alternatively traditional sexagesimal unit subdivisions used degree divided minutes minute seconds degreesminutesseconds also called notation subdivisions also called arcminute arcsecond respectively represented single double prime example 401875° using quotation mark characters additional precision provided using decimals arcseconds component
older system thirds fourths continues sexagesimal unit subdivision used alkashi ancient astronomers rarely used today subdivisions denotedcitation needed writing roman numeral number sixtieths superscript prime minute second 1iii third fourth hence modern symbols minute second word second also refer systemcitation needed

mathematical work beyond practical geometry angles typically measured radians rather degrees variety reasons example trigonometric functions simpler natural properties arguments expressed radians considerations outweigh convenient divisibility number complete turn 360° equal radians 180° equal radians equivalently degree mathematical constant ​π⁄180
