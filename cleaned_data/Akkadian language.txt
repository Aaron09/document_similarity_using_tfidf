akkadian preserved clay tablets dating back 2500 written using cuneiform script adopted sumerians using wedgeshaped symbols pressed clay employed akkadian scribes adapted cuneiform script could represent either sumerian logograms picturebased characters representing entire words sumerian syllables akkadian syllables phonetic complements however akkadian script practically became fully fledged syllabic script original logographic nature cuneiform became secondary though logograms frequent words temple continued used reason sign hand logogram word ilum signify even syllable additionally sign used determinative divine names
another peculiarity akkadian cuneiform many signs welldefined phonetic value certain signs distinguish different vowel qualities coordination direction syllable example rendered sign also sign often used syllable text
cuneiform many ways unsuited akkadian among flaws inability represent important phonemes semitic including glottal stop pharyngeals emphatic consonants addition cuneiform syllabary writing system‚Äîie consonant plus vowel comprised writing unit‚Äîfrequently inappropriate semitic language made triconsonantal roots three consonants plus vowels

existence back midvowel proposed cuneiform writing gives good proof this18 limited contrast different usigns lexical texts scribal differentiation reÔ¨Çect superimposition sumerian phonological system phoneme also proposed rather separate phoneme akkadian19
consonants vowels appear long short forms long consonants represented writing double consonants long vowels written macron distinction phonemic used grammar example iprusu decided versus iprus≈´ decided
stressedit
stress patterns akkadian disputed authors claiming nothing known topic however certain points reference rule vowel syncope next paragraph forms cuneiform might represent stressing certain vowels however attempts identifying rule stress unsuccessful
huenergard 200534 claims stress akkadian completely predictable syllable typology three syllable weights light heavy superheavy cvÃÇc last syllable superheavy stressed otherwise rightmost heavy syllable stressed word contains light syllables first syllable stressed
rule akkadian phonology certain short probably unstressed vowels dropped rule last vowel succession syllables short vowel dropped example declinational root verbal adjective root paris thus masculine singular nominative parsum parisum feminine singular nominative paristum parisatum additionally general tendency syncope short vowels later stages akkadian

roots akkadian language consist three consonants called radicals roots composed four consonants socalled quadriradicals radicals occasionally represented transcription uppercase letters example decide around radicals various infixes suffixes prefixes word generating grammatical functions inserted resulting consonantvowel pattern differentiates original meaning root also middle radical geminated represented doubled consonant transcription sometimes cuneiform writing
consonants termed weak radicals roots containing radicals give rise irregular forms
case number genderedit
formally akkadian three numbers singular dual plural three cases nominative accusative genitive however even earlier stages language dual number vestigial largely confined natural pairs eyes ears adjectives never found dual dual plural accusative genitive merged single oblique case
