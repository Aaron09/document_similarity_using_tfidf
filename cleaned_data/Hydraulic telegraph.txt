ancient hydraulic telegraph used aeneas send message


hydraulic telegraph either different hydraulictelegraph telecommunication systems earliest developed 4thcentury greece developed 19thcentury britain greek system deployed combination semaphoric fires latter british system operated purely hydraulic fluid pressure
although systems employed water sending receiver devices transmission media completely different ancient greek system transmitted semaphoric information receiver visually limited lineofsight distances good visibility weather conditions 19thcentury british system used waterfilled pipes effect changes water level receiver unit similar transparent waterfilled flexible tube used level indicator thus limiting range hydraulic pressure could generated transmitters device1
greek device extremely limited codes hence information could convey british device never deployed operation shortdistance demonstrations1 british device could however used visibility within range operation long conduits unheated freeze subzero temperatures —which contributed impracticality

ancient greek design described century aeneas tacticus century historian polybius according polybius used first punic send messages sicily carthage
system involved identical containers separate hills connected container would filled water vertical floated within rods inscribed various predetermined codes various points along height
send message sending operator would torch signal receiving operator synchronized would simultaneously open spigots bottom containers water would drain water level reached desired code point sender would lower torch operators would simultaneously close spigots thus length time senders torch visible could correlated specific predetermined codes messages
contemporary description ancient telegraphic method provided polybius histories polybius wrote2
