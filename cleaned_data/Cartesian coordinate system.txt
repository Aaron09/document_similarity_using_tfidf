adjective cartesian refers french mathematician philosopher rené descartes published idea 1637 independently discovered pierre fermat also worked three dimensions although fermat publish discovery1 french cleric nicole oresme used constructions similar cartesian coordinates well time descartes fermatcitation needed
descartes fermat used single axis treatments variable length measured reference axis concept using pair axes introduced later descartes géométrie translated latin 1649 frans schooten students commentators introduced several concepts trying clarify ideas contained descartes work2
development cartesian coordinate system would play fundamental role development calculus isaac newton gottfried wilhelm leibniz3 twocoordinate description plane later generalized concept vector spaces4
many coordinate systems developed since descartes polar coordinates plane spherical cylindrical coordinates threedimensional space

generalizationsedit
concept cartesian coordinates generalizes allow axes perpendicular andor different units along axis case coordinate obtained projecting point onto axis along direction parallel axis general hyperplane defined axes oblique coordinate system computations distances angles must modified standard cartesian systems many standard formulas pythagorean formula distance hold affine plane
notations conventionsedit
cartesian coordinates point usually written parentheses separated commas origin often labelled capital letter analytic geometry unknown generic coordinates often denoted letters plane threedimensional space custom comes convention algebra uses letters near alphabet unknown values coordinates points many geometric problems letters near beginning given quantities
conventional names often used domains physics engineering although letters used example graph showing pressure varies time graph coordinates denoted axis usually named coordinate measured along says xaxis yaxis taxis
another common convention coordinate naming subscripts coordinates ndimensional space especially greater unspecified authors prefer numbering xn−1 notations especially advantageous computer programming storing coordinates point array instead record subscript serve index coordinates
mathematical illustrations twodimensional cartesian systems first coordinate traditionally called abscissa measured along horizontal axis oriented left right second coordinate ordinate measured along vertical axis usually oriented bottom young children learning cartesian system commonly learn order read values cementing axis concepts starting mnemonics walk along hall stairs akin straight across axis vertically along axis6

righthand rule


fixing choosing xaxis determines yaxis direction namely yaxis necessarily perpendicular xaxis point marked xaxis choice half lines perpendicular designate positive negative choices determines different orientation also called handedness cartesian plane
usual orienting axes positive xaxis pointing right positive yaxis pointing xaxis first yaxis second axis considered positive standard orientation also called righthanded orientation
commonly used mnemonic defining positive orientation righthand rule placing somewhat closed right hand plane thumb pointing fingers point xaxis yaxis positively oriented coordinate system
orienting axes following left hand rule placing left hand plane thumb pointing
pointing thumb away origin along axis towards positive curvature fingers indicates positive rotation along axis
regardless rule used orient axes rotating coordinate system preserve orientation switching axes reverse orientation switching leave orientation unchanged

cartesian coordinate handedness


name derives righthand rule index finger right hand pointed forward middle finger bent inward right angle thumb placed right angle three fingers indicate relative directions zaxes righthanded system thumb indicates xaxis index finger yaxis middle finger zaxis conversely done left hand lefthanded system results
figure depicts left righthanded coordinate system threedimensional object represented twodimensional screen distortion ambiguity result axis pointing downward right also meant point towards observer whereas middleaxis meant point away observer circle parallel horizontal xyplane indicates rotation xaxis yaxis cases hence arrow passes front zaxis
figure another attempt depicting righthanded coordinate system ambiguity caused projecting threedimensional coordinate system plane many observers figure flipping convex cube concave corner corresponds possible orientations coordinate system seeing figure convex gives lefthanded coordinate system thus correct view figure imagine xaxis pointing towards observer thus seeing concave corner
