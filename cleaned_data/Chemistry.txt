etymology
word chemistry comes alchemy referred earlier practices encompassed elements chemistry metallurgy philosophy astrology astronomy mysticism medicine often seen linked quest turn lead another common starting material gold6 though ancient times study encompassed many questions modern chemistry defined study composition waters movement growth embodying disembodying drawing spirits bodies bonding spirits within bodies early century greekegyptian alchemist zosimos7 alchemist called chemist popular speech later suffix added describe chemist chemistry
modern word alchemy turn derived arabic word alkīmīā الکیمیاء origin term borrowed greek χημία χημεία89 egyptian origins since alkīmīā derived greek χημία turn derived word kemet ancient name egypt egyptian8 alternately alkīmīā derive χημεία meaning cast together10
