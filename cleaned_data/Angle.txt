identifying anglesedit
mathematical expressions common greek letters serve variables standing size angle avoid confusion meaning symbol typically used purpose lower case roman letters also used upper case roman letters context polygons figures article examples
geometric figures angles also identified labels attached three points define example angle vertex enclosed rays lines point point point point denoted ∠bac unicode u2220 angle

















displaystyle widehat

sometimes risk confusion angle referred simply vertex angle
potentially angle denoted ∠bac might refer four angles clockwise angle anticlockwise angle clockwise angle anticlockwise angle direction angle measured determines sign positive negative angles however many geometrical situations obvious context positive angle less equal degrees meant ambiguity arises otherwise convention adopted ∠bac always refers anticlockwise positive angle ∠cab anticlockwise positive angle
