geotechnical investigation designedit
main article geotechnical investigation
major tunnel project must start comprehensive investigation ground conditions collecting samples boreholes geophysical techniques informed choice made machinery methods excavation ground support reduce risk encountering unforeseen ground conditions planning route horizontal vertical alignments selected make best ground water conditions common practice locate tunnel deeper otherwise would required order excavate solid rock material easier support construction
conventional desk preliminary site studies yield insufficient information assess factors blocky nature rocks exact location fault zones standup times softer ground particular concern largediameter tunnels give information pilot tunnel drift tunnel driven ahead main excavation smaller tunnel less likely collapse catastrophically unexpected conditions incorporated final tunnel used backup emergency escape passage alternatively horizontal boreholes sometimes drilled ahead advancing tunnel face
geotechnical factors

standup time amount time newly excavated cavity support without added structures knowing parameter allows engineers determine excavation proceed support needed turn affects speed efficiency cost construction generally certain configurations rock clay greatest standup time sand fine soils much lower standup time3
groundwater control important tunnel construction water leaking tunnel vertical shaft greatly decrease standup time causing excavation become unstable risking collapse common control groundwater install dewatering pipes ground simply pump water out4 effective expensive technology ground freezing using pipes inserted ground surrounding excavation cooled special refrigerant fluids freezes ground around pipe whole space surrounded frozen soil keeping water permanent structure built
tunnel crosssectional shape also important determining standup time tunnel excavation wider high harder time supporting decreasing standup time square rectangular excavation difficult make selfsupporting concentration stress corners5
