educationedit
jobs chemists usually require least bachelors degree many positions especially research require master science doctor philosophy undergraduate programs emphasize mathematics physics well chemistry partly chemistry also known central science thus chemists ought wellrounded knowledge science masters level higher students tend specialize particular field fields specialization include biochemistry nuclear chemistry organic chemistry inorganic chemistry polymer chemistry analytical chemistry physical chemistry theoretical chemistry quantum chemistry environmental chemistry thermochemistry postdoctoral experience required certain positions
workers whose work involves chemistry complexity requiring education chemistry degree commonly referred chemical technicians technicians commonly work simpler routine analyses quality control clinical laboratories associate degree chemical technologists education andor experience chemical technician less chemist often bachelors degree different field science also associate degree chemistry many credits related chemistry education chemical technician experience also degrees specific become chemical technologist somewhat distinct required student interested becoming professional chemist chemical technologist involved management operation equipment instrumentation necessary perform chemical analyzes chemical technician part team chemical laboratory quality material intermediate products finished products analyzed also perform functions areas environmental quality control operational phase chemical plant

employmentedit
three major employers chemists academic institutions industry especially chemical industry pharmaceutical industry government laboratories
chemistry typically divided several major subdisciplines also several main crossdisciplinary specialized fields chemistry great deal overlap different branches chemistry well scientific fields biology medicine physics radiology several engineering disciplines

analytical chemistry analysis material samples gain understanding chemical composition structure analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods chemistry methods used subdisciplines chemistry excluding purely theoretical chemistry
biochemistry study chemicals chemical reactions chemical interactions take place living organisms biochemistry organic chemistry closely related example medicinal chemistry



chemist prepares fuel cell testing




chemist pours roundbottom flask



inorganic chemistry study properties reactions inorganic compounds distinction organic inorganic disciplines absolute much overlap importantly subdiscipline organometallic chemistry inorganic chemistry also study atomic molecular structure bonding
medicinal chemistry science involved designing synthesizing developing pharmaceutical drugs medicinal chemistry involves identification synthesis development chemical entities suitable therapeutic also includes study existing drugs biological properties quantitative structureactivity relationships
organic chemistry study structure properties composition mechanisms chemical reaction carbon compounds
physical chemistry study physical fundamental basis chemical systems processes particular energetics dynamics systems processes interest physical chemists important areas study include chemical thermodynamics chemical kinetics electrochemistry quantum chemistry statistical mechanics spectroscopy physical chemistry large overlap theoretical chemistry molecular physics physical chemistry involves calculus deriving equations
theoretical chemistry study chemistry theoretical reasoning usually within mathematics physics particular application quantum mechanics chemistry called quantum chemistry since second world development computers allowed systematic development computational chemistry developing applying computer programs solving chemical problems theoretical chemistry large overlap condensed matter physics molecular physics reductionism

major areas chemistry employ chemists fields chemical degrees useful include astrochemistry cosmochemistry atmospheric chemistry chemical engineering chemoinformatics electrochemistry environmental science forensic science geochemistry green chemistry history chemistry materials science medical science molecular biology molecular genetics nanotechnology nuclear chemistry oenology organometallic chemistry petrochemistry pharmacology photochemistry phytochemistry polymer chemistry supramolecular chemistry surface chemistry
