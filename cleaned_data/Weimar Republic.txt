process bringing major organisations line nazi principles service state called gleichschaltung gleichschaltung usually translated coordination sometimes forcible coordination58 compound word consisting gleich meaning alike schaltung means switching nsdap meant imply particular mechanical meaning word certain means wiring electrical generator electric motors generator made turn given speed turned certain angle motor connected also turn speed angle—in words synchronisationcitation needed nsdap thought generator civil groups motors wired itcitation needed
hitlers cabinet issued many decrees purpose gleichschaltung weeks following passage removed jews civil service hindenburgs request exception made jews served front world banned trade unions eventually outlawed political parties exiled published weekly neuer vorwarts prague hitler banned party confiscating assets abolishing parliamentary representation decree june
however opposition frequently addressed legislation process gleichschaltung often voluntary event mandated formal decree parties dissolved officially banned nazi partys coalition partner dnvp dissolved june hugenbergs resignation cabinet staatspartei formerly dissolved june june july catholic parties centre also wound time formal decree banned creation parties none left except nazis5960

many organisations showed willing anticipate gleichschaltung process coordinate accordance expectations autumn nazi dictatorship enormously strengthened striking much little hitler needed bring hitler took remarkably initiatives61

reichswehr however remained mostly untouched gleichschaltung hindenburgs death august 1934 military personnel swore oath loyalty directly hitler instead constitution thereafter military came gradually increasing pressure align nsdap ideology never entirely capitulated likewise holdings industrialists aristocratic junker landowners remained part untouched whilst administrative judicial machinery slightly tampered with49 nazi efforts coordinate christian churches roman catholic protestant mostly unsuccessful largely abandoned however churches whole present serious opposition hitler
aftermathedit
constitution 1919 never formally repealed enabling meant dead letter enabling breached hitler three occasions 1934 article stated

laws enacted government reich deviate constitution long affect institutions reichstag reichsrat rights president remain undisturbed

powers länder states transferred central government rendering reichsrat obsolete month later reichsrat dissolved president hindenburg died august hitler appropriated presidents powers enabling specify recourse could taken chancellor violated article judicial challenge ensued
following death hindenburg 1934 constitution largely forgotten minor exceptions political testament adolf hitler written shortly suicide appointed admiral karl doenitz succeed president rather fuehrer thereby reestablishing constitutional office dormant since hindenburgs death eleven years earlier april 1945 doenitz formed became known flensburg government facto controlled tiny area germany near danish border town flensburg dissolved allies

reasons failureedit
reasons weimar republics collapse subject continuing debate doomed beginning since even moderates disliked extremists left right loathed situation often referred democracy without democrats65 germany limited democratic traditions weimar democracy widely seen chaotic since weimar politicians blamed dolchstoß stabintheback widely believed theory germanys surrender world unnecessary traitors popular legitimacy government shaky ground normal parliamentary lawmaking broke replaced around 1930 series emergency decrees decreasing popular legitimacy government drove voters extremist parties
single reason explain failure weimar republic commonly asserted causes grouped three categories economic problems institutional problems roles specific individuals
economic problemsedit
main articles great depression central europe dawes plan reichsbank
weimar republic serious economic problems ever experienced western democracy history rampant hyperinflation massive unemployment large drop living standards primary factors 1923 1929 short period economic recovery great depression 1930s worldwide recession germany particularly affected depended heavily american loans 1926 million germans unemployed rose around million 1932 many blamed weimar republic made apparent political parties right left wanting disband republic altogether made democratic majority parliament impossible
weimar republic severely affected great depression economic stagnation increased demands germany repay debts owed united states weimar republic fragile existence depression devastating played major role nsdaps takeover
germans thought treaty versailles punishing degrading document forced surrender resourcerich areas massive amounts compensation punitive reparations caused consternation resentment actual economic damage resulting treaty versailles difficult determine official reparations considerable germany ended paying fraction however reparations damaged germanys economy discouraging market loans forced weimar government finance deficit printing currency causing rampant hyperinflation addition rapid disintegration germany 1919 return disillusioned army rapid change possible victory 1918 defeat 1919 political chaos caused psychological imprint germans could lead extreme nationalism later epitomised exploited hitler
historianswho agree many industrial leaders identified weimar republic labour unions social democrats established versailles concessions although hitler means abolish latter republic already unstable industry leaders supporting hitler even supported hitlers appointment often support nazism considered hitler temporary solution efforts abolish republiccitation needed industry support alone cannot explain hitlers enthusiastic support large segments population including many workers turned away left
princeton historian harold james argues clear link economic decline people turning extremist politics66
institutional problemsedit
widely believed 1919 constitution several weaknesses making eventual establishment dictatorship likely unknown whether different constitution could prevented rise nazi party however 1949 west german constitution basic federal republic germany generally viewed strong response flaws

institution reichspräsident frequently considered ersatzkaiser substitute emperor attempt replace emperors similarly strong institution meant diminish party politics article constitution gave president power take necessary steps public order security seriously disturbed endangered although intended emergency clause often used 1933 issue decrees without support parliament also made gleichschaltung easier
weimar republic accepted conform constitution long support thirds parliament majority needed change constitution verfassungsdurchbrechende gesetze precedent enabling 1933 basic 1949 requires explicit change wording prohibits abolishing basic rights federal structure republic
proportional representation without large thresholds meant party small amount support could gain entry reichstag many small parties extremist building political bases within system counter problem modern german bundestag introduced threshold limit party gain parliamentary representation however reichstag monarchy fractioned similar degree even elected majority vote tworound system republic fell small parties strength communists conservatives ultimately national socialists
reichstag could remove reichskanzler office even unable agree successor motion confidence meant since 1932 government could held office parliament came together result 1949 grundgesetz basic stipulates chancellor removed parliament unless successor elected time known constructive vote confidence
political parties started role creating government october 1918 massively inexperienced

role individualsedit
brünings economic policy 1930 1932 subject much debate caused many germans identify republic cuts social spending extremely liberal economics whether alternatives policy great depression open question
paul hindenburg became reichspräsident 1925 style monarchist conservative little love lost republic part formally acted within bounds constitution however ultimately advice others close appointed hitler chancellor thereby effectively ending republic
