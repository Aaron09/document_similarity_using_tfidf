surgeryedit




chest right breast mastectomy


surgery involves physical removal tumor typically along surrounding tissue lymph nodes biopsied surgery increasingly lymph node sampling performed sentinel lymph node biopsy
standard surgeries include

mastectomy removal whole breast
quadrantectomy removal onequarter breast
lumpectomy removal small part breast

tumor removed patient desires breast reconstruction surgery type plastic surgery performed improve aesthetic appearance treated site alternatively women breast prostheses simulate breast clothing choose flat chest nipple prosthesis used time following mastectomy
medicationedit
drugs used addition surgery called adjuvant therapy chemotherapy types therapy prior surgery called neoadjuvant therapy aspirin reduce mortality breast cancer115
currently three main groups medications used adjuvant breast cancer treatment hormoneblocking agents chemotherapy monoclonal antibodies
hormone blocking therapy

breast cancers require estrogen continue growing identified presence estrogen receptors progesterone receptors surface sometimes referred together hormone receptors cancers treated drugs either block receptors tamoxifen alternatively block production estrogen aromatase inhibitor anastrozole116 letrozole tamoxifen recommended years117 letrozole recommended years aromatase inhibitors suitable women menopause however group appear better tamoxifen118 active aromatase postmenopausal women different prevalent form premenopausal women therefore agents ineffective inhibiting predominant aromatase premenopausal women119 aromatase inhibitors given premenopausal women intact ovarian function unless also treatment stop ovaries working120

chemotherapy

chemotherapy predominantly used cases breast cancer stages particularly beneficial estrogen receptornegative disease chemotherapy medications administered combinations usually periods months common regimens known combines cyclophosphamide doxorubicin sometimes taxane drug docetaxel added regime known another common treatment cyclophosphamide methotrexate fluorouracil chemotherapy medications work destroying fastgrowing andor fastreplicating cancer cells either causing damage upon replication mechanisms however medications also damage fastgrowing normal cells cause serious side effects damage heart muscle dangerous complication doxorubicin example
