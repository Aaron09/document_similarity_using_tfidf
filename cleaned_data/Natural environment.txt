principal layersedit
earths atmosphere divided five main layers layers mainly determined whether temperature increases decreases altitude highest lowest layers

exosphere outermost layer earths atmosphere extends exobase upward mainly composed hydrogen helium
thermosphere thermosphere bottom exosphere called exobase height varies solar activity ranges 350–800 220–500 1150000–2620000 international space station orbits layer
mesosphere mesosphere extends stratopause 80–85 50–53 262000–279000 layer meteors burn upon entering atmosphere
stratosphere stratosphere extends tropopause 167000 stratopause boundary stratosphere mesosphere typically 164000 180000
troposphere troposphere begins surface extends 23000 poles 56000 equator variation weather troposphere mostly heated transfer energy surface average lowest part troposphere warmest temperature decreases altitude tropopause boundary troposphere stratosphere


layers

within five principal layers determined temperature several layers determined properties

ozone layer contained within stratosphere mainly located lower portion stratosphere 15–35 93–217 49000–115000 though thickness varies seasonally geographically ozone atmosphere contained stratosphere
ionosphere part atmosphere ionized solar radiation stretches 1000 160000 3280000 typically overlaps exosphere thermosphere forms inner edge magnetosphere
