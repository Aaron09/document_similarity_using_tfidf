historyedit
automotive navigation systems represent convergence number diverse technologies many available many years costly inaccessible limitations batteries display processing power overcome product became commercially viable1

1961 hidetsugu yagi designed wirelessbased navigation system design still primitive intended militaryuse
1966 general motors research working nonsatellitebased navigation assistance system called dair driver information routing initial tests found scalable practical provide navigation assistance decades later however concept would reborn onstar founded 19962
1973 japans ministry international trade industry miti fuji heavy industries sponsored catc comprehensive automobile traffic control japanese research project automobile navigation systems3
1979 miti established association electronic technology automobile traffic driving japan3
1980 electronic auto compass mechanism toyota crown
1981 earlier research catc leads first generation automobile navigation systems japanese companies honda nissan toyota used dead reckoning technology3
1981 hondas electro gyrocator first commercially available navigation system used inertial navigation systems tracked distance traveled start point direction headed4 also first display3

navigation data standard ndsedit
navigation data standard initiative industry grouping manufacturers navigation system suppliers data suppliers whose objective standardization data format used navigation systems well allow update capability effort began 2004 became registered association 200914 standardization would improve interoperability specifically allowing navigation maps used navigation systems manufacturers15 companies involved include volkswagen daimler renault adit aisin alpine electronics navigon navisams bosch denso mitsubishi harman international industries panasonic preh connect formerly technisat continental clarion navteq navinfo tomtom zenrin

road database stored solid state readonly memory optical media solid state flash memory magnetic media hard disk combination common scheme base permanently stored augmented detailed information region user interested always programmed factory media preprogrammed downloaded computer wireless connection bluetooth wifi directly used utilizing card reader
navigation device makers provide free updates customers updates often obtained vendors website accessed connecting navigation device
realtime dataedit
main article integration traffic data navigation systems
systems receive display information traffic congestion using either gprs3g data transmission mobile phones

color screens automotive navigation systems also used display television broadcasts movies
systems integrate communicate mobile phones handsfree talking messaging using bluetooth wifi
automotive navigation systems include personal information management meetings combined traffic public transport information system

original factory equipmentedit
many vehicle manufacturers offer navigation device option vehicles customers whose vehicles ship therefore purchase retrofit original factorysupplied unit cases straightforward plugandplay installation required wiring harness already present vehicle however manufacturers wiring required making installation complex
primary benefit approach integrated factorystandard installation many original systems also contain gyrocompass andor accelerometer accept input vehicles speed sensors reverse gear engagement signal output thereby allowing navigate dead reckoning signal temporarily unavailable16 however costs considerably higher options
