etymologyedit
word first used early 17thcentury flemish chemist helmont4 identified carbon dioxide first known air5 helmonts word appears simply phonetic transcription ancient greek word χάος chaos dutch pronounced like loch case helmont simply following established alchemical usage first attested works paracelsus according paracelsuss terminology chaos meant something like ultrararefied water6
alternative story7 helmonts word corrupted gahst geist signifying ghost spirit certain gases suggested supernatural origin ability cause death extinguish flames occur mines bottom wells churchyards lonely places
