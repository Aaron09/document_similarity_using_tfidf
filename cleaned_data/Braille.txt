international consensus braille alphabets follow french sorting order letters basic latin alphabet attempts unifying letters beyond international braille though differences remain example german braille contractions english braille unification avoids chaos nation reordering braille code match sorting order print alphabet happened algerian braille braille codes numerically reassigned match order arabic alphabet bear little relation values used countries compare modern arabic braille uses french sorting order happened early american version english braille letters reassigned match english alphabetical order convention sometimes seen letters beyond basic exploit physical symmetry braille patterns iconically example assigning reversed inverted hungarian braille bharati braille extent
third principle assign braille codes according frequency simplest patterns quickest ones write assigned frequent letters alphabet frequencybased alphabets used germany united states 19th century american braille none attested modern finally braille scripts dont order codes numerically japanese braille korean braille based abstract principles syllable composition
