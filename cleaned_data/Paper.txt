chemical pulping
main articles kraft process sulfite process soda pulping
make pulp wood chemical pulping process separates lignin cellulose fibres accomplished dissolving lignin cooking liquor washed cellulose preserves length cellulose fibres paper made chemical pulps also known woodfree papers–not confused treefree paper contain lignin deteriorates time pulp also bleached produce white paper consumes fibres chemical pulping processes used make paper made cotton already cellulose




microscopic structure paper micrograph paper autofluorescing ultraviolet illumination individual fibres sample around diameter


three main chemical pulping processes sulfite process dates back 1840s dominant method extent second world kraft process invented 1870s first used 1890s commonly practiced strategy advantages chemical reaction lignin produces heat used generator pulping operations using kraft process contributors electricity grid electricity adjacent paper mill another advantage process recovers reuses inorganic chemical reagents soda pulping another specialty process used pulp straws bagasse hardwoods high silicate content
mechanical pulping
major mechanical pulps thermomechanical pulp groundwood pulp process wood chipped steam heated refiners chips squeezed converted fibres steel discs groundwood process debarked logs grinders pressed rotating stones made fibres mechanical pulping remove lignin yield high however causes paper thus produced turn yellow become brittle time mechanical pulps rather short fibres thus producing weak paper although large amounts electrical energy required produce mechanical pulp costs less chemical kind
deinked pulp
paper recycling processes either chemically mechanically produced pulp mixing water applying mechanical action hydrogen bonds paper broken fibres separated recycled paper contains proportion virgin fibre sake quality generally speaking deinked pulp quality lower collected paper made
three main classifications recycled fibre

mill broke internal mill waste incorporates substandard gradechange paper made within paper mill goes back manufacturing system repulped back paper outofspecification paper sold therefore often classified genuine reclaimed recycled fibre however paper mills reusing waste fibre many years long recycling became popular
preconsumer waste offcut processing waste guillotine trims envelope blank waste generated outside paper mill could potentially landfill genuine recycled fibre source includes deinked preconsumer recycled material printed reach intended waste printers unsold publications10
postconsumer waste fibre paper used intended includes office waste magazine papers newsprint vast majority material printed either digitally conventional means lithography rotogravure either recycled printed paper deinking process first

recycled papers made recycled materials blended virgin pulp although generally strong bright papers made latter
additives
besides fibres pulps contain fillers chalk china clay11 improve characteristics printing writing12 additives sizing purposes mixed applied paper later manufacturing process purpose sizing establish correct level surface absorbency suit paint
producing paper
main articles paper machine papermaking
pulp paper machine formed paper water removed pressing drying
pressing sheet removes water force water forced sheet special kind felt confused traditional used collect water whereas making paper hand blotter sheet used instead
drying involves using heat remove water paper sheets earliest days paper making done hanging sheets like laundry modern times various forms heated drying mechanisms used paper machine common steamheated dryer reach temperatures used long sequences forty cans heat produced easily paper less percent moisture
finishing
paper undergo sizing alter physical properties various applications
paper point uncoated coated paper thin layer material calcium carbonate china clay applied sides order create surface suitable highresolution halftone screens uncoated papers rarely suitable screens coated uncoated papers surfaces polished calendering coated papers divided matte semimatte silk gloss gloss papers give highest optical density printed image
paper onto reels used printing presses sheets printing processes purposes fibres paper basically machine direction sheets usually longgrain grain parallel longer dimension sheet continuous form paper continuous stationery width holes punched edges folded stacks
paper grain
paper produced paper machines fourdrinier machine wove paper wire mesh transports leaves pattern density along paper grain across grain textured finishes watermarks wire patterns imitating handmade laid paper created appropriate rollers later stages machine
wove paper exhibit laidlines small regular lines left behind paper handmade mould made rows metal wires bamboo laidlines close together perpendicular chainlines apart handmade paper similarly exhibits deckle edges rough feathery borders13

paper stability
much early paper made wood pulp contained significant amounts alum variety aluminium sulfate salts significantly acidic alum added paper assist sizing20 making somewhat water resistant inks spread uncontrollably early papermakers realize alum added liberally cure almost every problem encountered making product would eventually detrimental21 cellulose fibres make paper hydrolyzed acid presence alum would eventually degrade fibres paper disintegrated process come known slow fire documents written paper significantly stable nonacidic additives make paper becoming prevalent stability papers less issue
paper made mechanical pulp contains significant amounts lignin major component wood presence light oxygen lignin reacts give yellow materials22 newsprint mechanical paper yellows paper made bleached kraft sulfite pulps contain significant amounts lignin therefore better suited books documents applications whiteness paper essential
paper made wood pulp necessarily less durable paper aging behavior paper determined manufacture original source fibers23 furthermore tests sponsored library congress prove paper risk acid decay cellulose produces formic acetic lactic oxalic acids24
mechanical pulping yields almost tonne pulp tonne wood used mechanical pulps sometimes referred high yield pulps almost twice yield chemical pulping mechanical pulps often cheaper massmarket paperback books newspapers tend mechanical papers book publishers tend acidfree paper made fully bleached chemical pulps hardback trade paperback books
