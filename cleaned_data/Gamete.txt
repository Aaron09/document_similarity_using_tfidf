gamete ancient greek γαμετή gamete gamein marry1 haploid cell fuses another haploid cell fertilization conception organisms sexually reproduce species produce morphologically distinct types gametes individual produces type female individual produces larger type gamete—called ovum egg—and male produces smaller tadpolelike type—called sperm example anisogamy heterogamy condition females males produce gametes different sizes case humans human ovum approximately 100000 times volume single human sperm cell23 contrast isogamy state gametes sexes size shape given arbitrary designators mating type name gamete introduced austrian biologist gregor mendel gametes carry half genetic information individual ploidy type created meiosis
oogenesis process female gamete formation animals process involves meiosis including meiotic recombination occurring diploid primary oocyte produce haploid ovum gamete spermatogenesis process male gamete formation animals process also involves meiosis including meiotic recombination occurring diploid primary spermatocyte produce haploid spermatozoon gamete

dissimilarityedit
contrast gamete diploid somatic cells individual contain copy chromosome sperm copy chromosome cell cells offspring genes expressing characteristics father mother gametes chromosomes exact duplicates either sets chromosomes carried diploid chromosomes often undergo random mutations resulting modified subsequently proteins phenotypes
determination humans birdsedit
humans normal ovum carry chromosome chromosomes whereas sperm carry either nonnormal ovum carrying chromosomes result irregularity either stages meiosis nonnormal sperm cell carrying either sexdefining chromosomes pair pair result forementioned reason ergo male sperm play role determining resulting zygote zygote chromosomes develop female chromosome develop male4 birds female ovum determines offspring sexdetermination system4
artificial gametesedit
artificial gametes also known vitro derived gametes stem cellderived gametes scdgs vitro generated gametes gametes derived stem cells research shows artificial gametes reproductive technique samesex male couples although surrogate mother would still required gestation period5 women passed menopause able produce eggs bear genetically related children artificial gametes5 robert sparrow wrote journal medical ethics embryos derived artificial gametes could used derive gametes process could repeated create multiple human generations laboratory6 technique could used create cell lines medical applications studying heredity genetic disorders6 additionally technique could used human enhancement selectively breeding desired genome using recombinant technology create enhancements arisen nature6
plantsedit
plants reproduce sexually also gametes however since plants alternation diploid haploid generations differences exist flowering plants flowers meiosis produce haploid generation produce gametes mitosis female haploid called ovule produced ovary flower mature haploid ovule produces female gamete ready fertilization male haploid pollen produced anther pollen lands mature stigma flower grows pollen tube flower haploid pollen produces sperm mitosis releases fertilization
