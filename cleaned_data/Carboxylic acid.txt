solubilityedit




carboxylic acid dimers


carboxylic acids polar hydrogenbond acceptors carbonyl hydrogenbond donors hydroxyl also participate hydrogen bonding together hydroxyl carbonyl group forms functional group carboxyl carboxylic acids usually exist dimeric pairs nonpolar media tendency selfassociate smaller carboxylic acids carbons soluble water whereas higher carboxylic acids less soluble increasing hydrophobic nature alkyl chain longer chain acids tend rather soluble lesspolar solvents ethers alcohols5
boiling pointsedit
carboxylic acids tend higher boiling points water increased surface area also tendency form stabilised dimers carboxylic acids tend evaporate boil dimers boiling occur either dimer bonds must broken entire dimer arrangement must vaporised increase enthalpy vaporization requirements significantly
acidityedit
carboxylic acids brønsted–lowry acids proton donors common type organic acid
carboxylic acids typically weak acids meaning partially dissociate cations rcoo− anions neutral aqueous solution example room temperature 1molar solution acetic acid acid molecules dissociated electronegative substituents give stronger acids
