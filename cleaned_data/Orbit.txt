defining gravitational potential energyedit
energy associated gravitational fields stationary body another external work pulled towards therefore gravitational potential energy since work required separate bodies pull gravity gravitational potential energy increases separated decreases approach another point masses gravitational energy decreases zero approach zero separation convenient conventional assign potential energy zero value infinite distance apart hence negative value since decreases zero smaller finite distances

planet moves orbit line planet sweeps constant area orbital plane given period time regardless part orbit planet traces period time means planet moves faster near perihelion near aphelion smaller distance needs trace greater cover area usually stated equal areas equal time
given orbit ratio cube semimajor axis square period constant

limitations newtons gravitationedit
note bound orbits point mass spherical body newtonian gravitational field closed ellipses repeat path exactly indefinitely nonspherical nonnewtonian effects caused slight oblateness earth relativistic effects thereby changing gravitational fields behavior distance cause orbits shape depart closed ellipses characteristic newtonian twobody motion twobody solutions published newton principia 1687 1912 karl fritiof sundman developed converging infinite series solves threebody problem however converges slowly much except special cases like lagrangian points method known solve equations motion system four bodies

rather exact closed form solution orbits many bodies approximated arbitrarily high accuracy approximations take forms

form takes pure elliptic motion basis adds perturbation terms account gravitational influence multiple bodies convenient calculating positions astronomical bodies equations motion moons planets bodies known great accuracy used generate tables celestial navigation still secular phenomena dealt postnewtonian methods
differential equation form used scientific missionplanning purposes according newtons laws forces acting body equal mass body times acceleration therefore accelerations expressed terms positions perturbation terms much easier describe form predicting subsequent positions velocities initial values position velocity corresponds solving initial value problem numerical methods calculate positions velocities objects short time future repeat calculation nauseam however tiny arithmetic errors limited accuracy computers math cumulative limits accuracy approach
