transport layer security predecessor secure sockets layer prohibited cryptographic protocols provide communications security computer network1 several versions protocols find widespread applications browsing email internet faxing instant messaging voice voip websites able secure communications servers browsers
protocol aims primarily provide privacy data integrity communicating computer applications13 secured connections client browser server wikipediaorg following properties

connection private secure symmetric cryptography used encrypt data transmitted keys symmetric encryption generated uniquely connection based shared secret negotiated start session handshake server client negotiate details encryption algorithm cryptographic keys first byte data transmitted algorithm negotiation shared secret secure negotiated secret unavailable eavesdroppers cannot obtained even attacker places middle connection reliable attacker modify communications negotiation without detected
identity communicating parties authenticated using publickey cryptography authentication made optional generally required least parties typically server
connection ensures integrity message transmitted includes message integrity check using message authentication code prevent undetected loss alteration data transmission3

addition properties careful configuration provide additional privacyrelated properties forward secrecy ensuring future disclosure encryption keys cannot used decrypt communications recorded past2
supports many different methods exchanging keys encrypting data authenticating message integrity algorithm result secure configuration involves many configurable parameters choices provide privacyrelated properties described list exchange authentication cipher security data integrity tables

descriptionedit
clientserver applications protocol communicate across network designed prevent eavesdropping tampering
since applications communicate either without necessary client indicate server setup connection5 main ways achieving different port number connections example port https another mechanism client make protocolspecific request server switch connection example making starttls request using mail news protocols
client server agreed negotiate stateful connection using handshaking procedure6 protocols handshake asymmetric cipher establish cipher settings also sessionspecific shared communication encrypted using symmetric cipher handshake client server agree various parameters used establish connections security

handshake begins client connects tlsenabled server requesting secure connection client presents list supported cipher suites ciphers hash functions
list server picks cipher hash function also supports notifies client decision
server usually provides identification form digital certificate certificate contains server name trusted certificate authority vouches authenticity certificate servers public encryption
client confirms validity certificate proceeding
generate session keys used secure connection client either

encrypts random number servers public sends result server server able decrypt private parties random number generate unique session subsequent encryption decryption data session
uses diffie–hellman exchange securely generate random unique session encryption decryption additional property forward secrecy servers private disclosed future cannot used decrypt current session even session intercepted recorded third party



concludes handshake begins secured connection encrypted decrypted session connection closes steps fails handshake fails connection created
neatly single layer model tcpip model78 runs reliable transport protocol tcp9 would imply transport layer serves encryption higher layers normally function presentation layer however applications generally transport layer78 even though applications using must actively control initiating handshakes handling exchanged authentication certificates9

digital certificatesedit
main article public certificate
digital certificate certifies ownership public named subject certificate indicates certain expected usages allows others relying parties rely upon signatures assertions made private corresponds certified public
certificate authoritiesedit
main article certificate authority
typically relies trusted thirdparty certificate authorities establish authenticity certificates trust usually anchored list certificates distributed user agent software27 modified relying party
according netcraft monitors active certificates marketleading symantec since beginning survey verisign authentication services business unit purchased symantec symantec currently accounts third certificates valid certificates used million busiest websites counted netcraft28
consequence choosing x509 certificates certificate authorities public infrastructure necessary verify relation certificate owner well generate sign administer validity certificates convenient verifying identities trust 2013 mass surveillance disclosures made widely known certificate authorities weak point security standpoint allowing maninthemiddle attacks mitm2930
