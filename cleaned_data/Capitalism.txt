nature conceptualising supply curve requires firm perfect competitor influence market price true point supply curve answer question firm faced potential price much output able willing sell firm market power decision much output provide market influences market price therefore firm faced price question becomes less relevant
economists distinguish supply curve individual firm market supply curve market supply curve obtained summing quantities supplied suppliers potential price thus graph supply curve individual firms supply curves added horizontally obtain market supply curve
