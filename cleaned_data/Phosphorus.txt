chemiluminescence
known early times green glow emanating white phosphorus would persist time stoppered cease robert boyle 1680s ascribed debilitation fact oxygen consumed 18th century known pure oxygen phosphorus glow all22 range partial pressures heat applied drive reaction higher pressures23

emit visible light reaction slow little intermediates required produce luminescence hence extended time glow continues stoppered
since time phosphors phosphorescence used loosely describe substances shine dark without burning although term phosphorescence derived phosphorus reaction gives phosphorus glow properly called chemiluminescence glowing cold chemical reaction phosphorescence reemitting light previously fell onto substance excited it26
