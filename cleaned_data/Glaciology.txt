general categories glaciation glaciologists distinguish alpine glaciation accumulations rivers confined valleys continental glaciation unrestricted accumulations covered much northern continents

alpine flows valleys mountainous areas forms tongue moving towards plains alpine glaciers tend make topography rugged adding improving scale existing features large ravines called cirques ridges rims cirques meet called arêtes
continental sheet found today high latitudes greenlandantarctica thousands square kilometers area thousands meters thick tend smooth landscapes
