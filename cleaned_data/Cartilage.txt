cartilage resilient smooth elastic tissue rubberlike padding covers protects ends long bones joints structural component cage nose bronchial tubes intervertebral discs many body components hard rigid bone much stiffer much less flexible muscle
rigidity cartilage often serves purpose holding tubes open body examples include rings trachea cricoid cartilage carina
cartilage composed specialized cells called chondrocytes produce large amount collagenous extracellular matrix abundant ground substance rich proteoglycan elastin fibers cartilage classified three types elastic cartilage hyaline cartilage fibrocartilage differ relative amounts collagen proteoglycan
cartilage contain blood vessels avascular nerves aneural nutrition supplied chondrocytes diffusion compression articular cartilage flexion elastic cartilage generates fluid flow assists diffusion nutrients chondrocytes compared connective tissues cartilage slow turnover extracellular matrix repair




three different types cartilage elastic hyaline fibrous elastic cartilage cells closer together creating less intercellular space elastic cartilage found external flaps parts larynx hyaline cartilage fewer cells elastic cartilage intercellular space hyaline cartilage found nose ears trachea parts larynx smaller respiratory tubes fibrous cartilage least amount cells amount intercellular space fibrous cartilage found spine menisci

structureedit
developmentedit
main article chondrogenesis
embryogenesis skeletal system derived mesoderm germ layer chondrification also known chondrogenesis process cartilage formed condensed mesenchyme tissue differentiates chondroblasts begins secreting molecules aggrecan collagen type form extracellular matrix
following initial chondrification occurs embryogenesis cartilage growth consists mostly maturing immature cartilage mature state division cells within cartilage occurs slowly thus growth cartilage usually based increase size mass cartilage itself1
articular cartilageedit
articular cartilage function dependent molecular composition extracellular matrix consists mainly proteoglycan collagens main proteoglycan cartilage aggrecan name suggests forms large aggregates hyaluronan aggregates negatively charged hold water tissue collagen mostly collagen type constrains proteoglycans responds tensile compressive forces experienced cartilage2 cartilage growth thus refers matrix deposition also refer growth remodeling extracellular matrix great stress patellofemoral joint resisted knee extension articular cartilage patella among thickest human body
functionedit
mechanical propertiesedit
mechanical properties articular cartilage load bearing joints knee studied extensively macro micro nanoscales mechanical properties include response cartilage frictional compressive shear tensile loading cartilage resilient displays viscoelastic properties3
frictional propertiesedit
lubricin glycoprotein abundant cartilage synovial fluid plays major role biolubrication wear protection cartilage4
repairedit
cartilage limited repair capabilities chondrocytes bound lacunae cannot migrate damaged areas therefore cartilage damage difficult heal also hyaline cartilage blood supply deposition matrix slow damaged hyaline cartilage usually replaced fibrocartilage scar tissue last years surgeons scientists elaborated series cartilage repair procedures help postpone need joint replacement
bioengineering techniques developed generate cartilage using cellular scaffolding material cultured cells grow artificial cartilage5
clinical significanceedit
diseaseedit
main article chondropathy
several diseases affect cartilage chondrodystrophies group diseases characterized disturbance growth subsequent ossification cartilage common diseases affect cartilage listed

osteoarthritis osteoarthritis disease whole joint however affected tissues articular cartilage cartilage covering bones articular cartilage—a subset hyaline cartilage thinned eventually completely wearing away resulting bone bone within joint leading reduced motion pain osteoarthritis affects joints exposed high stress therefore considered result wear tear rather true disease treated arthroplasty replacement joint synthetic joint often made stainless steel alloy cobalt chromoly ultra high molecular weight polyethylene uhmwpe chondroitin sulfate glucosamine sulfate supplements claimed reduce symptoms osteoarthritis little good evidence support claim6
traumatic rupture detachment cartilage knee frequently damaged partially repaired knee cartilage replacement therapy often athletes talk damaged cartilage knee referring damaged meniscus fibrocartilage structure articular cartilage
achondroplasia reduced proliferation chondrocytes epiphyseal plate long bones infancy childhood resulting dwarfism
costochondritis inflammation cartilage ribs causing chest pain
spinal disc herniation asymmetrical compression intervertebral disc ruptures saclike disc causing herniation soft content hernia often compresses adjacent nerves causes back pain
relapsing polychondritis destruction probably autoimmune cartilage especially nose ears causing disfiguration death occurs suffocation larynx loses rigidity collapses

tumors made cartilage tissue either benign malignant occur usually appear bone rarely preexisting cartilage benign tumors called chondroma malignant ones chondrosarcoma tumors arising tissues also produce cartilagelike matrix best known pleomorphic adenoma salivary glands
matrix cartilage acts barrier preventing entry lymphocytes diffusion immunoglobulins property allows transplantation cartilage individual another without fear tissue rejection
imagingedit
cartilage absorb xrays normal vivo conditions injected synovial membrane cause xrays absorbed resulting void radiographic film bone meniscus represents cartilage vitro xray scans outer soft tissue likely removed cartilage boundary enough contrast presence cartilage refraction xray7
