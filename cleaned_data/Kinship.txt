descent rulesedit
many societies kinship connections important rules though expressed taken granted four main headings anthropologists categorize rules descent bilateral unilineal ambilineal double descent6

bilateral descent twosided descent affiliates individual less equally relatives fathers mothers sides good example yako crossriver state nigeria
unilineal rules affiliates individual descent either males females subdivided patrilineal male matrilineal female societies patrilineal examples matrilineal system descent nyakyusa tanzania nair kerala india many societies practise matrilineal system often patrilocal residence still exercise significant authority
ambilineal cognatic rule affiliates individual kinsmen fathers mothers line people societies practise system affiliate group relatives fathers others mothers individual choose side wants affiliate samoans south pacific excellent example ambilineal society core members samoan descent group live together compound
double descent refers societies patrilineal matrilineal descent group recognized societies individual affiliates purposes group patrilineal kinsmen purposes group matrilineal kinsmen widely known case double descent afikpo state nigeria although patrilineage considered important method organization afikpo considers matrilineal ties important

descent groupsedit
descent group social group whose members talk common ancestry unilineal society descent individual reckoned either mothers fathers line descent matrilineal descent individuals belong mothers descent group matrilineal descent includes mothers brother societies pass along inheritance sisters children succession sisters patrilineal descent individuals belong fathers descent group societies iroquois kinship system typically uniliineal iroquois proper specifically matrilineal
society reckons descent bilaterally bilineal descent reckoned father mother without unilineal descent groups societies eskimo kinship system like inuit yupik western societies typically bilateral egocentric kindred group also typical bilateral societies
societies reckon descent patrilineally purposes matrilineally others arrangement sometimes called double descent instance certain property titles inherited male line others female line
societies also consider descent ambilineal hawaiian kinship offspring determine lineage matrilineal line patrilineal line
lineages clans phratries moieties matrimonial sidesedit
lineage unilineal descent group demonstrate common descent known apical ancestor unilineal lineages matrilineal patrilineal depending whether traced mothers fathers respectively whether matrilineal patrilineal descent considered significant differs culture culture
clan generally descent group claiming common descent apical ancestor often details parentage important elements clan tradition nonhuman apical ancestors called totems examples clans found chechen chinese irish japanese polish scottish tlingit somali societies
phratry descent group composed clans whose apical ancestors descended common ancestor
society divided exactly descent groups called moiety french word half halves obliged marry called matrimonial moieties houseman white 1998b bibliography discovered numerous societies kinship network analysis shows halves marry another similar matrimonial moieties except halves—which call matrimonial sides7—are neither named descent groups although egocentric kinship terms consistent pattern sidedness whereas sidedness culturally evident imperfect8
word deme refers endogamous local population unilineal descent9 thus deme local endogamous community without internal segmentation clans

societies kinship political relations organized around membership corporately organized dwellings rather around descent groups lineages house windsor concept house society originally proposed claude lévistrauss called sociétés maison1011 concept applied understand organization societies mesoamerica moluccas north africa medieval europe1213 lévistrauss introduced concept alternative corporate kinship group among cognatic kinship groups pacific region socially significant groupings within societies variable membership kinship reckoned bilaterally fathers mothers come together short periods property genealogy residence basis groups existence14
marriage affinityedit
main article marriage
marriage socially ritually recognized union legal contract spouses establishes rights obligations children inlaws15 definition marriage varies according different cultures principally institution interpersonal relationships usually intimate sexual acknowledged defined broadly marriage considered cultural universal broad definition marriage includes monogamous polygamous samesex temporary
marriage usually creates normative legal obligations individuals involved offspring produce marriage result example union woman children born woman recognized legitimate offspring partners16 edmund leach argued definition marriage applied cultures offered list rights frequently associated marriage including sexual monopoly rights respect children specific rights differing across cultures17

schneiders critique genealogical conceptsedit
questions raised within anthropology study ‘kinship’ david schneider others 1960s onwards anthropology paid little attention notion kinship bonds anything connected consanguineal genealogical relatedness local cultural conceptions schneiders 1968 study38 symbolic meanings surrounding ideas kinship american culture found americans ascribe special significance blood ties well related symbols like naturalness marriage raising children within culture later work 1972 1984 schneider argued unexamined genealogical notions kinship embedded anthropology since morgans early work39 american anthropologists anthropologists western europe made mistake assuming particular cultural values blood thicker water common societies natural universal human cultures form ethnocentrism concluded unexamined assumptions whole enterprise kinship anthropology built faulty foundations 1984 book critique study kinship gave fullest account critique

certainly morgan 187010 actual bonds blood relationship force vitality quite apart social overlay also acquired biological relationship accounts radcliffebrown called source social cohesion schneider 1984

schneider emphasised distinction notion social relationship intrinsically given inalienable birth social relationship created constituted maintained process interaction schneider 1984 schneider used example citamangen relationship society early research previously glossed father relationship illustrate problem

schneider also dismissed sociobiological account biological influences maintaining ethnographic evidence janet carsten employed studies malays43 reassess kinship uses idea relatedness move away preconstructed analytic opposition biological social carsten argued relatedness described terms indigenous statements practices fall outside anthropologists conventionally understood kinship

biology psychology kinshipedit

approach evolutionary psychology continues take view genetic relatedness genealogy understanding human kinship patterns contrast sahlins position daly wilson argue categories near distant vary independently consanguinal distance society earth daly 199752 p282 current view humans inborn culturally affected system detecting certain forms genetic relatedness important factor sibling detection especially relevant older siblings infant ones mother seen care infant infant oneself assumed related another factor especially important younger siblings cannot first method persons grew together another related another genetic detection based major histocompatibility complex major histocompatibility complex sexual selection kinship detection system turn affects genetic predispositions incest taboo tendency altruism towards relatives53
issue within approach many societies organize according descent exclusively according kinship explanation kinship form clear boundaries centered differently individual contrast descent groups usually form clear boundaries provide easy create cooperative groups various sizes54
according evolutionary psychology hypothesis assumes descent systems optimized assure high genetic probability relatedness lineage members males prefer patrilineal system paternal certainty high males prefer matrilineal system paternal certainty research supports association study finding patrilineal society paternity confidence matrilineal society high paternal certainty another association pastoral societies relatively often patrilineal compared horticultural societies wealth pastoral societies form mobile cattle easily used bride price favor concentrating resources sons marry54
