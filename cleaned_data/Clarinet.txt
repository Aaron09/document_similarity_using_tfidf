addition primary compression wave waves known harmonics created harmonics caused factors including imperfect wobbling shaking reed reed sealing mouthpiece opening part wave cycle creates flattened section sound wave imperfections bumps holes bore wide variety compression waves created primarily harmonics reinforced extra waves gives clarinet characteristic tone22
