rocks composed grains minerals homogeneous solids formed chemical compound arranged orderly manner aggregate minerals forming rock held together chemical bonds types abundance minerals rock determined manner formed
many rocks contain silica sio2 compound silicon oxygen forms earths crust material forms crystals compounds rock proportion silica rocks minerals major factor determining name properties2
rocks classified according characteristics mineral chemical composition permeability texture constituent particles particle size physical properties result processes formed rocks3 course time rocks transform type another described geological model called rock cycle transformation produces three general classes rock igneous sedimentary metamorphic
three classes subdivided many groups however hardandfast boundaries allied rocks increase decrease proportions minerals pass gradations distinctive structures kind rock thus traced gradually merging another hence definitions adopted rock names simply correspond selected points continuously graduated series4

sample igneous gabbro


igneous rock derived latin word igneus meaning fire ignis meaning fire formed cooling solidification magma lava magma derived partial melts preexisting rocks either planets mantle crust typically melting rocks caused three processes increase temperature decrease pressure change composition
igneous rocks divided main categories

plutonic intrusive rocks result magma cools crystallizes slowly within earths crust common example type granite


volcanic extrusive rocks result magma reaching surface either lava fragmental ejecta forming minerals pumice basalt3

chemical abundance rate cooling magma typically forms sequence known bowens reaction series major igneous rocks found along scale2
earths crust volume consists igneous rocks making plentiful category basalts gabbros granite granodiorites diorites syenites peridotites dunites oceanic crust basalt igneous rock mafic composition granites similar rocks known metagranitoids form much continental crust5 types igneous rocks described formed beneath surface earths crust diverse properties depending composition temperature pressure conditions formed

sedimentary sandstone iron oxide bands


sedimentary rocks formed earths surface accumulation cementation fragments earlier rocks minerals organisms6 chemical precipitates organic growths water sedimentation process causes clastic sediments pieces rock organic particles detritus settle accumulate minerals chemically precipitate evaporite solution particulate matter undergoes compaction cementation moderate temperatures pressures diagenesis
deposited sediments formed weathering earlier rocks erosion source area transported place deposition water wind mass movement glaciers agents denudation rocks comprise mudstone shale siltstone sandstones carbonate rocks limestone dolostone3 crust volume composed sedimentary rocks shales remainder consists limestone sandstone arkoses sedimentary rocks often contain fossils sedimentary rocks form influence gravity typically deposited horizontal near horizontal layers strata referred stratified rocks small fraction sedimentary rocks deposited steep slopes show cross bedding layer stops abruptly along interface another layer eroded first laid atop first
metamorphic rock

metamorphic banded gneiss


metamorphic rocks formed subjecting rock type—sedimentary rock igneous rock another older metamorphic rock—to different temperature pressure conditions original rock formed process called metamorphism meaning change form result profound change physical properties chemistry stone original rock known protolith transforms mineral types forms minerals recrystallization3 temperatures pressures required process always higher found earths surface temperatures greater pressures 1500 bars7 metamorphic rocks compose crust volume5
three major classes metamorphic rock based upon formation mechanism intrusion magma heats surrounding rock causes contact metamorphism—a temperaturedominated transformation pressure metamorphism occurs sediments buried deep ground pressure dominant temperature plays smaller role termed burial metamorphism result rocks jade heat pressure play role mechanism termed regional metamorphism typically found mountainbuilding regions2
depending structure metamorphic rocks divided general categories possess texture referred foliated remainders termed nonfoliated name rock determined based types minerals present schists foliated rocks primarily composed lamellar minerals micas gneiss visible bands differing lightness common example granite gneiss varieties foliated rock include slates phyllites mylonite familiar examples nonfoliated metamorphic rocks include marble soapstone serpentine branch contains quartzite—a metamorphosed form sandstone—and hornfels2
