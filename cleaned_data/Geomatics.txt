geomatics engineering geomatic engineering geospatial engineering rapidly developing engineering discipline focuses spatial information information location location primary factor used integrate wide range data spatial analysis visualization geomatics engineers apply engineering principles spatial information implement relational data structures involving measurement sciences thus using geomatics acting spatial information engineers geomatics engineers manage local regional national global spatial data infrastructures geomatics engineering also involves aspects computer engineering software engineering civil engineering
geomatics field incorporates several others older field land surveying engineering along many aspects spatial data management ranging data science cartography geography following advanced developments digital data processing nature tasks required professional land surveyor evolved term surveying longer accurately covers whole range tasks profession deals like profession mechanics part mechanical engineering surveying part geomatic engineering societies become complex information spatial position associated becomes critical decisionmaking personal business perspective also community largescale governmental viewpoint
therefore geomatics engineer involved extremely wide variety information gathering activities applications geomatics engineers design develop operate systems collecting analyzing spatial information land oceans natural resources manmade features
traditional land surveying strand geomatics engineering concerned determination recording boundaries areas real property parcels preparation interpretation legal land descriptions tasks closely related civil engineering include design layout public infrastructure urban subdivisions mapping control surveys construction projects
geomatics engineers serve society collecting monitoring archiving maintaining diverse spatial data infrastructures geomatics engineers utilize wide range technologically advanced tools digital theodolitedistance meter total stations global positioning system equipment digital aerial imagery satellite airborne computerbased geographic information systems tools enable geomatics engineer gather process analyze visualize manage spatially related information solve wide range technical societal problems
geomatics engineering field activity integrates acquisition processing analysis display management spatial information exciting grouping subjects spatial environmental information sciences broad range employment opportunities well offering challenging pure applied research problems vast range interdisciplinary fields
different schools different countries education curriculum administered name surveying others names geomatics geomatics engineering geospatial information engineering surveying engineering geodesy geoinformatics occupations time often taught civil engineering education programs universities include departments relevant geodata sciences informatics computer science applied mathematics facts demonstrate breadth depth scope highly interdisciplinary nature geomatics engineering
