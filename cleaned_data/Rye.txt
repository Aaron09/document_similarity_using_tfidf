diseasesedit
main article list diseases
highly susceptible ergot fungus1617 consumption ergotinfected humans animals results serious medical condition known ergotism ergotism cause physical mental harm including convulsions miscarriage necrosis digits hallucinations death historically damp northern countries depended staple crop subject periodic epidemics condition occurrences ergotism periods high incidents people persecuted witches emphasis placed salem witch trials massachusetts 1692 sudden rise number people accused witches earlier examples taken europe well18
usesedit
grain refined flour flour high gliadin glutenin therefore lower gluten content wheat flour also contains higher proportion soluble fiber alkylresorcinols phenolic lipids present high amounts bran layer pericarp testa aleurone layers wheat 01–03 weight19 bread including pumpernickel made using flour widely eaten food northern eastern europe2021 also used make crisp bread
grain used make alcoholic drinks like whiskey beer uses grain include kvass herbal medicine known extract straw used livestock bedding cover crop green manure soil amendment make crafts corn dollies
physical characteristicsedit
physical properties affect attributes final food product seed size surface area porosity surface area seed directly correlates drying heat transfer time22 smaller seeds increased heat transfer leads lower drying time seeds lower amounts porosity also lower tendencies lose water process drying22
cultivationedit
grows well much poorer soils necessary cereal grains thus especially valuable crop regions soil sand peat plants withstand cold better small grains survive snow cover would otherwise result winterkill winter wheat farmers grow winter ryes planted begin grow autumn spring plants develop produce crop18
fallplanted shows fast growth summer solstice plants reach maximum height springplanted wheat recently germinated vigorous growth suppresses even noxious weed competitors grown without application herbicides
common unwanted invader winter wheat fields allowed grow mature cause substantially reduced prices docking harvested wheat23

previously addressed secale cereale survive many climates many environments researchers pinpointed certain proteins responsible antifreeze properties proteins help organism remain alive subzero environments species capability occurs different manner antifreeze property fish insects also antifreeze characteristic specifically leaves winter cereale produce various polypeptides possess antifreeze capability different antifreeze polypeptides produced fish insects24 addition survival capabilities high stress circumstances cereale known improve soil caliber gentle paddies lives however evidence suggest biomass increased greenhouse emissions specifically methane released cultivation moreover research also suggests biomass plant changes different stages growth minimized selecting specific growth stage harvested methane production cereale heightened prematuring stage development however flowering stage plant methane least significant amount information good know flowering stage would also opportune time increased nutritional value plant well unfavorable effects cereale environment diminished25 conclusion cereale used varying environments
diversity usesedit
along secale cereales relationship impact environment also valuable species expansive diversity uses northern portugal fourteen different populations cereale analyzed order better understand differences discovered storage proteins diverse possess overall genetic variation well useful information know scientists diversity breeding produce efficient cultivar cereale rye26 moreover beneficial characteristics cereale also used improve certain characteristics useful plants like wheat pollination abilities wheat vastly improved crosspollination cereale addition chromosome increased size wheat anther along increasing number pollen grains present27 along improved wheat optimal characteristics cereale also combined another perennial specifically montanum guss order produce cereanum beneficial characteristics hybrid cereanum grown environments even less favorable soil protects soils erosion addition plant mixture improved forage known contain digestible fiber protein28 information diversity genome29 cereanum’s ability cross fertilize species useful information scientists know attempt come various plant species able feed humanity future without leaving negative footprint environment
harvestingedit
harvesting similar wheat usually done combine harvesters plants thresh winnow grain either gather straw onto wagons release field soil amendment resultant grain stored local silos transported regional grain elevators combined lots storage distant shipment mechanised agriculture harvesting manual task performed scythes sickles3031 often shocked drying storage threshing done manually beating seed heads floor object
health concernsedit
like wheat barley hybrids derivatives contains gluten makes unsuitable grain consumption people glutenrelated disorders celiac disease nonceliac gluten sensitivity wheat allergy among others32 nevertheless wheat allergy patients tolerate barley33
ergotism illness result eating grains infected ergot fungi produce lsd25like toxins infected products although longer common illness modern food safety efforts common 20th century still happen today food safety vigilance breaks down34
