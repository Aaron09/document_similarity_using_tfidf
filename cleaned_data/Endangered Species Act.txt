2014 house representatives passed 21st century endangered species transparency would require government disclose data uses determine species classification president threatened veto bill unlikely pass senate21
preventing extinctionedit
esas primary goal prevent extinction imperiled plant animal life secondly recover maintain populations removing lessening threats survival
petition listingedit
considered listing species must meet five criteria section
present threatened destruction modification curtailment habitat range
utilization commercial recreational scientific educational purposes
species declining disease predation
inadequacy existing regulatory mechanisms
natural manmade factors affecting continued existence
potential candidate species prioritized emergency listing given highest priority species face significant risk well category22
species listed ways united states fish wildlife service noaa fisheries also called national marine fisheries service directly list species candidate assessment program individual organizational petition request nmfs list species species true taxonomic species subspecies case vertebrates distinct population segment procedures types except personorganization petition 90day screening period
listing process economic factors cannot considered must based solely best scientific commercial data available23 1982 amendment added word solely prevent consideration biological status species congress rejected president ronald reagans executive order 12291 required economic analysis government agency actions house committees statement economic considerations relevance determinations regarding status species24
opposite result happened 1978 amendment congress added words taking consideration economic impact provision critical habitat designation25 1978 amendment linked listing procedure critical habitat designation economic considerations almost completely halted listings almost 2000 species withdrawn consideration26

species survival recoveryedit
critical habitatedit
provision section establishes critical habitat regulatory link habitat protection recovery goals requiring identification protection lands water necessary recover endangered species35 determine exactly critical habitat needs open space individual population growth food water light nutritional requirements breeding sites seed germination dispersal needs lack disturbances considered36
habitat loss primary threat imperiled species endangered species 1973 allowed fish wildlife service national marine fisheries service nmfs designate specific areas protected critical habitat zones 1978 congress amended make critical habitat designation mandatory requirement threatened endangered species
amendment also added economics process determining habitat shall designate critical habitat basis best scientific data available taking consideration economic impact impact specifying area critical habitat25 congressional report 1978 amendment described conflict section additions rest

critical habitat provision startling section wholly inconsistent rest legislation constitutes loophole could readily abused secretary vulnerable political pressure sympathetic basic purposes endangered species house representatives report 951625 197837

amendment 1978 added economic considerations 1982 amendment prevented economic considerations
several studies effect critical habitat designation species recovery rates done 1997 2003 although criticized38 taylor study 200339 found species critical habitat twice likely improving40
critical habitats required contain areas essential conservation imperiled species private public lands fish wildlife service policy limiting designation lands waters within federal agencies exclude essential areas determine economic costs exceed benefit mute costs benefits determined
federal agencies prohibited authorizing funding carrying actions destroy adversely modify critical habitats section regulatory aspect critical habitat apply directly private nonfederal landowners largescale development logging mining projects private state land typically require federal permit thus become subject critical habitat regulations outside parallel regulatory processes critical habitats also focus encourage voluntary actions land purchases grant making restoration establishment reserves41
requires critical habitat designated time within year species placed endangered list practice designations occur several years listing41 1978 1986 regularly designated critical habitat 1986 reagan administration issued regulation limiting protective status critical habitat result critical habitats designated 1986 late 1990s late 1990s early 2000s series court orders invalidated reagan regulations forced nmfs designate several hundred critical habitats especially hawaii california western states midwest eastern states received less critical habitat primarily rivers coastlines december 2006 reagan regulation replaced though suspended nonetheless agencies generally changed course since 2005 tried designate critical habitat near time listing
provisions revolve around preventing extinction critical habitat focus recovery species critical habitat twice likely recovering species without critical habitat32

amendment also added public participation process ranking order similar listing procedures recovery plans highest priority species likely benefit recovery plans especially threat construction developmental economic activity44 recovery plans cover domestic migratory species46
exemptionsedit
exemptions occur requires federal agencies consult fish wildlife service national marine fisheries service nmfs project occurs habitat listed species example project might timber harvest proposed forest service timber harvest could impact listed species biological assessment prepared forest service reviewed nmfs
question answered whether listed species harmed action harm minimized harm cannot avoided project agency seek exemption endangered species committee panel composed members executive branch least appointee state project occur five seven committee members must vote exemption allow taking harass harm pursue hunt shoot wound kill trap capture collect significant habitat modification47 attempt engage conduct listed species48
long exemption considered endangered species committee forest service either nmfs consulted biological implications timber harvest consultation informal determine harm occur formal harm believed likely questions answered consultations whether species harmed whether habitat harmed action hinder recovery listed species49

surprises ruleedit
surprises rule meant protect landowner unforeseen circumstances occur make landowners efforts prevent mitigate harm species fall short surprises policy controversial recent reforms incidental take permit granted fish wildlife service loses much ability protect species mitigation measures landowner prove insufficient landowner permittee would required aside additional land conservation money federal government would additional protection measures58
safe harbor agreementsedit
