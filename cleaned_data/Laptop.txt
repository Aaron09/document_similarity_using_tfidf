portability usually first feature mentioned comparison laptops versus desktop pcs56 physical portability allows laptop used many places—not home office also commuting flights coffee shops lecture halls libraries clients locations meeting room within home portability enables laptop users move device living room dining room family room portability offers several distinct advantages

productivity using laptop places desktop cannot used help employees students increase productivity work school tasks example office worker reading work emails hourlong commute train student homework university coffee shop break lectures
immediacy carrying laptop means instant access information including personal work files allows better collaboration coworkers students laptop flipped open look report document spreadsheet presentation anytime anywhere
uptodate information person desktop problem synchronization arises changes made computer automatically propagated others ways resolve problem including physical transfer updated files using flash memory stick cdroms using synchronization software internet cloud computing however transporting single laptop locations avoids problem entirely files exist single location always uptodate
connectivity 2010s proliferation wifi wireless networks cellular broadband data services hsdpa evdo others many urban centers combined nearubiquitous wifi support modern laptops57 meant laptop could easy internet local network connectivity remaining mobile wifi networks laptop programs especially widespread university campuses58

power consumption laptops several times powerefficient desktops typical laptop uses 20–120 compared 100–800 desktops could particularly beneficial large businesses hundreds personal computers thus multiplying potential savings homes computer running home media server print server
quiet laptops typically much quieter desktops components quieter slower 25inch hard drives less heat production leading fewer slower cooling fans
battery charged laptop continue used case power outage affected short power interruptions blackouts desktop needs uninterruptible power supply handle short interruptions blackouts spikes achieving onbattery time 20–30 minutes desktop requires large expensive ups59
