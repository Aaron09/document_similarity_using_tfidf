nonsubordination theoryedit
nonsubordination theory sometimes called dominance theory area feminist legal theory focuses power differential women309 nonsubordination theory takes position society especially society differences women perpetuate power imbalance309 unlike topics within feminist legal theory nonsubordination theory focuses specifically certain sexual behaviors including control women’s sexuality sexual harassment pornography violence women generally310 catharine mackinnon argues nonsubordination theory best addresses particular issues affect “almost exclusively” women311 mackinnon advocates nonsubordination theory theories like formal equality substantive equality difference theory sexual violence forms violence women question “sameness difference” rather best viewed “more central inequalities” women311 though nonsubordination theory discussed great length evaluating various forms sexual violence women also serves basis understanding domestic violence occurs nonsubordination theory tackles issue domestic violence subset broader problem violence women domestic violence victims overwhelmingly female312
proponents nonsubordination theory propose several reasons works best explain domestic violence first certain recurring patterns domestic violence indicate result intense anger arguments rather form subordination313 evidenced part fact domestic violence victims typically abused variety situations variety means313 example victims sometimes beaten sleeping separated batterer often abuse takes financial emotional form addition physical abuse313 supporters nonsubordination theory examples dispel notion battering always result heat moment anger intense arguments313 also batterers often employ manipulative deliberate tactics abusing victims “range searching destroying treasured object striking areas body show bruises scalp areas would embarrassed show others bruises”313 behaviors even useful batterer batterer victim share children batterer often controls family’s financial assets making victim less likely leave would children risk314
professor martha mahoney university miami school also points notion “separation assault”—a phenomenon batterer assaults victim attempting attempted leave abusive relationship—as additional evidence domestic violence used subordinate victims batterers315 batterer’s unwillingness allow victim leave relationship substantiates idea violence used force victim continue fulfill batterer’s wishes obey him315 nonsubordination theorists argue actions—the variety abusive behaviors settings exploiting victim’s children assault upon separation—suggest larger problem merely inability properly manage anger though anger byproduct behaviors313 purpose actions keep victim sometimes entire family subordinate batterer according nonsubordination theory315
second rationale using nonsubordination theory explain domestic violence beyond variety tactics used abusers frequency domestic violence occurs overpowers idea merely result batterer’s anger professor mahoney explains sensationalism generated media coverage “big” particularly horrific domestic violence cases difficult people conceptualize frequently domestic violence happens society315 however domestic violence regular occurrence experienced half people united states overwhelming number victims female315 sheer number domestic violence victims united states suggests domestic violence merely result intimate partners cannot control anger315 nonsubordination theory contends batterer’s desire subordinate victim uncontainable anger explains frequency domestic violence315 nonsubordination theorists argue forms feminist legal theory offer explanation phenomenon domestic violence generally frequency occurs
critics nonsubordination theory complain offers solutions problems points example proponents nonsubordination theory criticize certain approaches taken address domestic violence legal system mandatory arrest prosecution policies316 policies take discretion away enforcement forcing police officers arrest suspected domestic violence offenders prosecutors prosecute cases316 discourse surrounding mandatory arrest opponents argue undermines victims autonomy discourages empowerment women discounting resources available puts victims risk domestic abuse states implemented mandatory arrest laws higher homicide rates shown consistent decline reporting rates317 advocates policies contend criminal justice system sometimes reach victims domestic violence offender knows arrested deter future domestic violence conduct316 people endorse nonsubordination theory argue policies serve subordinate women forcing take certain course action thus compounding trauma experienced abuse316 however nonsubordination theory offers better appropriate solutions scholars argue forms feminist legal theory appropriate address issues domestic sexual violence
