importanceedit
historically canals immense importance commerce development growth vitality civilization 1855 lehigh canal carried million tons anthracite coal 1930s company built operated century pulled plug canals still operation modern fraction numbers fueled enabled economic growth indeed practically prerequisite urbanization industrialization—for movement bulk materials coal ores difficult marginally affordable without water transport materials fueled industrial developments metallurgy resulting spiral increasing mechanization 17th–20th century leading research disciplines industries economies scale raising standard living industrialized society
surviving canals including ship canals today primarily service mostly bulk cargo large ship transportation industries whereas critical smaller inland waterways conceived engineered boat barge canals largely supplanted filled abandoned left deteriorate kept service staffed state employees dams locks maintained flood control pleasure boating replacement gradual beginning first united states mid1850s canal shipping first augmented began replaced using much faster less geographically constrained limited generally cheaper maintain railways
early 1880s canals little ability economically compete rail transport next couple decades coal increasingly diminished heating fuel choice growth coal shipments levelled later world motortrucks came last small barge canals steady decline cargo tonmiles alongside many railways flexibility steep slope climbing capability lorries taking cargo hauling increasingly road networks improved also freedom make deliveries well away rail lined road beds ditches dirt couldnt operate winter
constructionedit
canals built three ways combination three depending available water available path

human made streams


canal created stream presently exists either body canal sides canal created making dykes levees piling dirt stone concrete building materials finished shape canal seen cross section known canal prism1 water canal must provided external source like streams reservoirs waterway must change elevation engineering works like locks lifts elevators constructed raise lower vessels examples include canals connect valleys higher body land like canal midi canal briare panama canal
canal constructed dredging channel bottom existing lake channel complete lake drained channel becomes canal serving drainage surrounding polder providing transport examples include lage vaart also build parallel dikes existing lake forming canal drain remaining parts lake eastern central parts north canal constructed cases pumping stations required keep land surrounding canal either pumping water canal surrounding waters pumping land canal


canalization navigations



stream canalized make navigable path predictable easier maneuver canalization modifies stream carry traffic safely controlling flow stream dredging damming modifying path frequently includes incorporation locks spillways make river navigation examples include lehigh canal northeastern pennsylvanias coal region basse saône canal mines moselle aisne river riparian zone restoration required



lateral canals


stream difficult modify canalization second stream created next least near existing stream called lateral canal meander large horshoe bend series curves distance source waters stream lengthening effective length order lower ratio rise slope pitch existing stream usually acts water source landscape around banks provide path body examples include chesapeake ohio canal canal latéral loire garonne lateral canal juliana canal

prior development pound lock china chhaio weiyo2 later europe 15th century either flash locks consisting single gate used ramps sometimes equipped rollers used change level flash locks practical plenty water available
locks water builders adopted approaches situations little water available include boat lifts falkirk wheel caisson water boats float moved levels inclined planes caisson hauled steep railway
cross stream road valley delay caused flight locks either side would unacceptable valley spanned navigable aqueduct famous example wales pontcysyllte aqueduct unesco world heritage site across valley river
another option dealing hills tunnel example approach harecastle tunnel trent mersey canal tunnels practical smaller canals
canals attempted keep changes level minimum canals known contour canals would take longer winding routes along land uniform altitude generally later canals took direct routes requiring various methods deal change level
canals various features tackle problem water supply cases like suez canal canal simply open canal level number approaches adopted taking water existing rivers springs option cases sometimes supplemented methods deal seasonal variations flow sources unavailable reservoirs—either separate canal built course—and back pumping used provide required water cases water pumped mines used feed canal certain cases extensive feeder canals built bring water sources located canal
large amounts goods loaded unloaded canal canal basin built would normally section water wider general canal cases canal basins contain wharfs cranes assist movement goods
section canal needs sealed drained maintenance stop planks frequently used consist planks wood placed across canal form generally placed preexisting grooves canal bank modern canals guard locks gates sometimes placed allow section canal quickly closed either maintenance prevent major loss water canal breach

claim first pure canal great britain debated sankey bridgewater supporters19 first true canal united kingdom newry canal northern ireland constructed thomas steers 1741
sankey brook navigation connected helens river mersey often claimed first modern purely artificial canal although originally scheme make sankey brook navigable included entirely artificial channel effectively canal along sankey brook valley1920 however bridgewater supporters point last quartermile navigation indeed canalized stretch brook bridgewater canal less obviously associated existing river captured popular imagination inspired canals1920
mideighteenth century duke bridgewater owned number coal mines northern england wanted reliable transport coal rapidly industrializing city manchester commissioned engineer james brindley build canal purpose brindleys design included aqueduct carrying canal river irwell engineering wonder immediately attracted tourists1920 construction canal funded entirely duke called bridgewater canal opened 1761 first major british canal21
canals proved highly successful boats canal horsedrawn towpath alongside canal horse walk along horsedrawn system proved highly economical became standard across british canal network commercial horsedrawn canal boats could seen canals late 1950s although dieselpowered boats often towing second unpowered boat become standard
canal boats could carry thirty tons time horse pulling21 times amount cargo horse possible cart huge increase supply bridgewater canal reduced price coal manchester nearly twothirds within year opening bridgewater also huge financial success earning spent construction within years
success proved viability canal transport soon industrialists many parts country wanted canals bridgewater canal early canals built groups private individuals interest improving communications staffordshire famous potter josiah wedgwood opportunity bring bulky cargoes clay factory doors transport fragile finished goods market manchester birmingham away water minimizing breakages within years bridgewaters opening embryonic national canal network came construction canals oxford canal trent mersey canal22

development often outandout speculation people would shares newly floated company simply sell immediate profit regardless whether canal ever profitable even built period canal mania huge sums invested canal building although many schemes came nothing canal system rapidly expanded nearly 4000 miles 6400 kilometres length21
