briggs peter burke identify five kinds reading developed relation introduction print

critical reading fact texts finally became accessible general population critical reading emerged people given option form opinions texts
dangerous reading reading seen dangerous pursuit considered rebellious unsociable especially case women reading could stir dangerous emotions love women could read could read love notes
creative reading printing allowed people read texts interpret creatively often different ways author intended
extensive reading print allowed wide range texts become available thus previous methods intensive reading texts start finish began change texts readily available people began reading particular topics chapters allowing much extensive reading wider range topics
private reading became linked rise individualism print reading often group event person would read group people print literacy rose availability texts thus reading became solitary pursuit
