archaeological field surveys






reasons area undergoes archaeological field survey

artifacts found locals picked artifacts
literary sources literary sources provided archaeologists clues settlement locations archaeologically documented
oral sources many locations local stories contain hint greater past often truth
local knowledge many cases locals actually know find something interest archaeologists
previous surveys places survey carried past recorded obscure academic journal
previous excavations excavations carried middle 20th century notoriously poorly documented
lack knowledge many areas world little known nature organisation past human activity
