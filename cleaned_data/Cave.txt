types formationedit
formation development caves known speleogenesis occur course millions years6 caves formed various geologic processes variable sizes involve combination chemical processes erosion water tectonic forces microorganisms pressure atmospheric influences isotopic dating techniques applied cave sediments order determine timescale geologic events occurred help form shape present caves6

caves formed time surrounding rock called primary caves
lava tubes formed volcanic activity common primary caves lava flows downhill surface cools solidifies liquid lava continues flow crust flows hollow tube remains examples caves found canary islands jejudo basaltic plains eastern idaho places kazumura cave near hilo hawaii remarkably long deep lava tube long
lava caves include limited lava tubes caves formed volcanic activity include rift caves lava mold caves open vertical volcanic conduits inflationary caves

caves found along coasts around world special case littoral caves formed wave action zones weakness cliffs often weaknesses faults also dykes beddingplane contacts wavecut caves level later uplift elsewhere places thailands phang solutional caves flooded subject littoral erosion caves generally around metres length exceed metres
corrasional cave erosional caveedit




salt cave mount sodom israel


corrasional erosional caves form entirely erosion flowing streams carrying rocks sediments form type rock including hard rocks granite generally must zone weakness guide water fault joint subtype erosional cave wind aeolian cave carved windborn sediments many caves formed initially solutional processes often undergo subsequent phase erosional vadose enlargement active streams rivers pass
glacier caveedit
main article glacier cave




glacier cave four glacier four mountain washington 1920


glacier caves formed melting flowing water within glaciers cavities influenced slow flow tends collapse caves glacier caves sometimes misidentified caves though latter term properly reserved bedrock caves contain yearround formations
fracture caveedit
fracture caves formed layers soluble minerals gypsum dissolve layers less soluble rock rocks fracture collapse blocks stone
talus caveedit
talus caves formed openings among large boulders fallen random heap often bases cliffs unstable deposits called talus scree subject frequent rockfalls landslides
anchialine caveedit
main article anchialine cave
anchialine caves caves usually coastal containing mixture freshwater saline water usually water occur many parts world often contain highly specialized endemic fauna
physical patternsedit

branchwork caves resemble surface dendritic stream patterns made passages join downstream tributaries branchwork caves common cave patterns formed near sinkholes groundwater recharge occurs passage branch separate recharge source converges higher order branches downstream12
angular network caves form intersecting fissures carbonate rock fractures widened chemical erosion fractures form high narrow straight passages persist widespread closed loops12
anastomotic caves largely resemble surface braided streams passages separating meeting drainage usually form along structure rarely cross upper lower beds12
spongework caves formed solution cavities joined mixing chemically diverse water cavities form pattern threedimensional random resembling sponge12
ramiform caves form irregular large rooms galleries passages randomized threedimensional rooms form rising water table erodes carbonate rock hydrogensulfide enriched water12
caves vertical caves potholes simply pits consist vertical shaft rather horizontal cave passage associated structural patterns

geographic distributionedit




domica cave slovak karst slovakia


caves found throughout world small portion explored documented cavers distribution documented cave systems widely skewed toward countries caving popular many years france italy australia united states result explored caves found widely europe asia north america oceania sparse south america africa antarctica
rough generalization large expanses north america asia contain documented caves whereas areas madagascar deciduous forests parts brazil contain many documented caves worlds expanses soluble bedrock researched cavers distribution documented caves likely shift example china despite containing around half worlds exposed limestone—more 1000000 square kilometres 390000 mi—has relatively documented caves
