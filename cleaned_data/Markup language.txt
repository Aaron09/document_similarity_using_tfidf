typesedit
three main general categories electronic markup23

presentational markup
kind markup used traditional wordprocessing systems binary codes embedded within document text produce wysiwyg effect markup usually hidden human users even authors editors


procedural markup
markup embedded text provides instructions programs process text wellknown examples include troff postscript expected processor text beginning following instructions encountered text markup often edited markup visible directly manipulated author popular proceduralmarkup systems usually include programming constructs macros subroutines defined invoked name


descriptive markup
markup used label parts document rather provide specific instructions processed wellknown examples include latex html objective decouple inherent structure document particular treatment rendition markup often described semantic example descriptive markup would htmls cite used label citation descriptive markup—sometimes called logical markup conceptual markup—encourages authors write describes material conceptually rather visually4

considerable blurring lines types markup modern wordprocessing systems presentational markup often saved descriptivemarkuporiented systems processed procedurally implementations programming constructs proceduralmarkup systems used create higherlevel markup systems descriptive latex
recent years number small largely unstandardized markup languages developed allow authors create formatted text browsers wikis forums sometimes called lightweight markup languages markdown markup language used wikipedia examples wiki markup
historyedit
etymology originedit
term markup derived traditional publishing practice marking manuscript involves adding handwritten annotations form conventional symbolic printers instructions margins text paper manuscript printed computer jargon used coding proof centuries task done primarily skilled typographers known markup men5 copy markers6 marked text indicate typeface style size applied part passed manuscript others typesetting hand markup also commonly applied editors proofreaders publishers graphic designers indeed document authors
gencodeedit
first wellknown public presentation markup languages computer text processing made william tunnicliffe conference 1967 although preferred call generic coding seen response emergence programs runoff used control notations often specific target typesetting device 1970s tunnicliffe development standard called gencode publishing industry later first chair international organization standardization committee created sgml first standard descriptive markup language book designer stanley rice published speculation along similar lines 19707 brian reid 1980 dissertation carnegie mellon university developed theory working implementation descriptive markup actual
however researcher charles goldfarb commonly seen today father markup languages goldfarb upon basic idea working primitive document management system intended firms 1969 helped invent later year first publicly disclosed 1973
1975 goldfarb moved cambridge massachusetts silicon valley became product planner almaden research center convinced ibms executives deploy commercially 1978 part ibms document composition facility product widely used business within years
sgml based gencode developed goldfarb 19748 goldfarb eventually became chair sgml committee sgml first released 8879 standard october 1986
troff nroffedit
early examples computer markup languages available outside publishing industry found typesetting tools unix systems troff nroff systems formatting commands inserted document text typesetting software could format text according editors specifications trial error iterative process document printed correctly9 availability wysiwyg publishing software supplanted much languages among casual users though serious publishing work still uses markup specify nonvisual structure texts wysiwyg editors usually save documents markuplanguagebased format

sgml specified syntax including markup documents well separately describing tags allowed document type definition schema allowed authors create markup wished selecting tags made sense named natural languages thus sgml properly metalanguage many particular markup languages derived late substantial markup languages based sgml system including example docbook sgml promulgated international standard international organization standardization 8879 1986
sgml found wide acceptance fields largescale documentation requirements however many found cumbersome difficult learn—a side effect design attempting much flexible example sgml made tags starttags even optional certain contexts developers thought markup would done manually overworked support staff would appreciate saving keystrokescitation needed

noticeable differences html xhtml rule tags must closed empty html tags must either closed regular endtag replaced special form space optional frequently used enables prexml browsers sgml parsers accept another attribute values tags must quoted finally attribute names within xhtml namespace must lowercase valid html hand caseinsensitive
