three galileos five siblings survived infancy youngest michelangelo michelagnolo also became noted lutenist composer although contributed financial burdens galileos young adulthood michelangelo unable contribute fair share fathers promised dowries brothersinlaw would later attempt seek legal remedies payments michelangelo would also occasionally borrow funds galileo support musical endeavours excursions financial burdens contributed galileos early desire develop inventions would bring additional income

cristiano bantis 1857 painting galileo facing roman inquisition


christian world prior galileos conflict church majority educated people subscribed either aristotelian geocentric view earth center universe heavenly bodies revolved around earth64 tychonic system blended geocentrism heliocentrism65 nevertheless following death copernicus galileo heliocentrism relatively uncontroversial65 copernicuss work used pope gregory xiii reform calendar 158266
opposition heliocentrism galileos writings combined religious scientific objections fueled political events scientific opposition came tycho brahe others arose fact heliocentrism true annual stellar parallax observed though none copernicus correctly postulated parallax negligible stars distant however brahe countered since stars appeared measurable size stars distant would gigantic fact larger celestial body brahes system contrast stars little distant saturn stars comparable size67
religious opposition heliocentrism arose biblical references psalm 9610 chronicles 1630 include text stating world firmly established cannot moved manner psalm 1045 says lord earth foundations never moved ecclesiastes states rises sets returns place68
galileo defended heliocentrism based astronomical observations 1609 sidereus nuncius 1610 december 1613 grand duchess christina florence confronted galileos friends followers benedetto castelli biblical objections motion earth according maurice finocchiaro done friendly gracious manner curiosity prompted incident galileo wrote letter castelli argued heliocentrism actually contrary biblical texts bible authority faith morals science letter published circulated widely69
1615 galileos writings heliocentrism submitted roman inquisition father niccolo lorini claimed galileo followers attempting reinterpret bible seen violation council trent looked dangerously like protestantism70 lorini specifically cited galileos letter castelli71 galileo went rome defend copernican biblical ideas start 1616 monsignor francesco ingoli initiated debate galileo sending essay disputing copernican system galileo later stated believed essay instrumental action copernicanism followed72 according maurice finocchiaro ingoli probably commissioned inquisition write expert opinion controversy essay provided chief direct basis inquisitions actions73 essay focused eighteen physical mathematical arguments heliocentrism borrowed primarily arguments tycho brahe notedly mentioned brahes argument heliocentrism required stars much larger ingoli wrote great distance stars heliocentric theory clearly proves fixed stars size surpass equal size orbit circle earth itself74 essay also included four theological arguments ingoli suggested galileo focus physical mathematical arguments mention galileos biblical ideas75 february 1616 inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism foolish absurd philosophy formally heretical since explicitly contradicts many places sense holy scripture inquisition found idea earths movement receives judgement philosophy regard theological truth least erroneous faith76 original document inquisitorial commission made widely available 201477

abandon completely opinion stands still center world earth moves henceforth hold teach defend whatever either orally writing78

decree congregation index banned copernicuss revolutionibus heliocentric works correction78 bellarmines instructions prohibit galileo discussing heliocentrism mathematical philosophic idea long advocate physical truth479
next decade galileo stayed well away controversy revived project writing book subject encouraged election cardinal maffeo barberini pope urban viii 1623 barberini friend admirer galileo opposed condemnation galileo 1616 galileos resulting book dialogue concerning chief world systems published 1632 formal authorization inquisition papal permission80
earlier pope urban viii personally asked galileo give arguments heliocentrism book careful advocate heliocentrism made another request views matter included galileos book latter requests fulfilled galileo
whether unknowingly deliberately simplicio defender aristotelian geocentric view dialogue concerning chief world systems often caught errors sometimes came across fool indeed although galileo states preface book character named famous aristotelian philosopher simplicius latin simplicio italian name simplicio italian also connotation simpleton81 portrayal simplicio made dialogue concerning chief world systems appear advocacy book attack aristotelian geocentrism defence copernican theory unfortunately relationship pope galileo words urban viii mouth simplicio
historians agree galileo malice felt blindsided reaction book82 however pope take suspected public ridicule lightly copernican advocacy
galileo alienated biggest powerful supporters pope called rome defend writings83 september 1632 finally arrived february 1633 brought inquisitor vincenzo maculani charged throughout trial galileo steadfastly maintained since 1616 faithfully kept promise hold condemned opinions initially denied even defending however eventually persuaded admit contrary true intention reader dialogue could well obtained impression intended defence copernicanism view galileos rather implausible denial ever held copernican ideas 1616 ever intended defend dialogue final interrogation july 1633 concluded threatened torture tell truth maintained denial despite threat84
sentence inquisition delivered june three essential parts

galileo found vehemently suspect heresy namely held opinions lies motionless centre universe earth centre moves hold defend opinion probable declared contrary holy scripture required abjure curse detest opinions85
sentenced formal imprisonment pleasure inquisition86 following commuted house arrest remained rest life
offending dialogue banned action announced trial publication works forbidden including might write future87
