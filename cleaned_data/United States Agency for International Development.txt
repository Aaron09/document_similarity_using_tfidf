world iiedit
realization early industrializers like united states could provide technical assistance countries development efforts spread gradually late 1800s leading substantial number visits countries technical experts generally official support government even missions unofficial japan china turkey several latin american countries requested missions government also initiated missions particularly central america caribbean felt interests might affected failed elections excessive debt infectious diseases crises fiscal management monetary institutions election management mining schooling roads flood control urban sanitation among missions subjects35
technical missions however part systematic usgsupported program possibly closest approximation development assistance would become china foundation promotion education culture36 established 1924 using funds provided china reparations following boxer conflict foundations activities ranged widely included support development leading chinese university tsinghua university
notable early example government foreign assistance disaster relief contribution 1915 committee relief belgium headed herbert hoover prevent starvation belgium german invasion world 1919 created american relief administration also headed hoover provided food primarily eastern europe
world wars however assistance lowincome countries often product private initiative including prominently work private foundations rockefeller foundation near east foundation37 rockefeller foundation example assisted breeding improved maize wheat varieties latin america supported public health initiatives asia38
institutionalization development assistanceedit
coming world stimulated government create proved permanent sustained foreign programs evolved usaid39 development assistance focussed initially latin america since countries region regularly requesting expert assistance cabinet departments interdepartmental committee cooperation american republics established 1938 state department chair ensure systematic responses4041
ambitiously also created institution first time would take active role development assistance programming institute interamerican affairs iiaa chartered march 1942 institute initiative coordinator interamerican affairs nelson rockefeller future vice president united states family whose fortune financed rockefeller foundation iiaas 1400 employees provided technical assistance across central south america economic stabilization food supply health sanitation benefits included development sources materials disrupted regions war424344
iiaas operational approach pattern subsequent technical assistance developing countries including ultimately usaid45 country program comprising group projects given sector—health food supply schools—was planned implemented jointly local staff working office located developing country itself46 iiaas case offices called missions today servicios
1945 iiaa transferred state department basis positive evaluations ambassadors latin america state department succeeded getting congressional authorization extend initially 1950 195547 existing technicalassistance agencies continued work parallel iiaa particular department agriculture’s office foreign agricultural relations ofar continued operate separately 195448

maturation development assistance institutionsedit
development assistance institutionalized nearly global scale strong currents change foreign economic policy 1950s affected development assistance worked times called continued existence question process finally resulted creation usaid 1961 usaid continued tcas core mechanism—providing technical assistance incountry resident offices—and supplemented substantial amounts financial assistance
postwar foreign contextedit
point four established context number programs largescale foreign effort 1940s51 1943 allies united nations established united nations relief rehabilitation administration unrra52 immediately supplied relief germany japan funded appropriations government relief occupied areas garioa53 1948 relief succeeded reconstruction assistance marshall plan mainly western europe year china established joint commission rural reconstruction54 starting mainland continuing decades taiwan provided sustained development assistance also fulbright program academic exchanges established 1946 globalizing wartime program exchange visits professionals latin america united states
time point four conceived also participated initiative technical assistance developing countries series actions 1948 1949 general assembly economic social council ecosoc created expanded program technical assistance epta55 provided eptas financing56 1955 epta adopted countryled approach country programmed according plan drawn receiving country consultation ecosoc also created technical assistance board similarly usgs wartime interdepartmental committee coordinated provided lowincome countries various individual agencies
point four focussed technical assistance provided financial assistance limited amounts support technical initiatives administration congress appreciated approach could implemented smaller budgets needed programs mainly provided financial assistance like marshall plan

impact koreaedit
coordination development assistance marshall plan tightened response 1950–51 korea october 1951 congress passed mutual security creating mutual security agency reported directly president supervised civilian military assistance increased emphasis largescale financial assistance allies provided civilian “economic assistance” intended help allies make greater military efforts therefore often called “defense support”58
mutual security agency absorbed marshall plan otherwise scheduled 1952 technical cooperation administration remained semiautonomous agency state department administer point four 1951 supervision msa59 msas director adopted policy would operate given country countryone agency required agency transfer programs close countries60
impact change administrationedit
1953 eisenhower administration took office presidents party white house since 193361 took critical view previous administrations’ policies including globalizing policies 1940s deal initiatives 1930s62
overall goal administration administer government efficiently spending63 tca’s technical assistance developing countries small budget item considered longterm program although fresh funds appropriated annually economic assistance “defense support” considered inherently shortterm measure required specific authorization casebycase yearbyyear basis64 eisenhower administration proposed place financial assistance allies increasingly finance exports words trade aid65 respect financial assistance developing countries policy maintained provided primarily exportimport bank world bank66 furthermore available commercial terms primarily finance private investment67
administer overall foreign assistance program efficiently pres eisenhower integrated management single agency newly created foreign operations administration foa68 msas direction iiaa part abolished august 1953 country offices became known united states operations missions usoms foa69 president directed agencies technical assistance developing countries foas management well usda particular transferred technical assistance programs ofar reconstituted foreign agricultural service focus building global markets farm products70
administrative functions also consolidated various agencies came addition mutual security july 1953 instructed reduce personnel least within days71 large number tcas senior professionals summarily dismissed foas administrator mounted effort compensate lower staffing drawing experts universities private voluntary organizations72 exim banks lending volume developing countries also dramatically 195373
gradual change course eisenhoweredit
changing world events differences opinion within eisenhower administration soon altered administrations cutbacks however
first trade strategy required import goods allies administration unable convince congress liberalize import policy74 contrary main foreign commercial measure taken time went direction ramped subsidies exports agricultural products 1953 amendment mutual security much larger agricultural trade development assistance 1954 known pl48075 allowed government farm surpluses sell developing countries inconvertible local currencies76 much pl480s foreigncurrency revenue used supplement development assistance budgets pl480 revenues first twenty years sometimes huge although pl480 become smaller continues provide resources usaid nutrition disaster relief programs77
second several factors arose favored largescale economic assistance developing countries especially asia south korea needed massive economic assistance armistice finally signed july 195378 economic assistance south vietnam ramped retreat france 195479 global scale cold evolved particularly death joseph stalin march 1953 direction rivalry influence lowincome countries seeking financing development initiatives india particular case country felt needed provide economic assistance balance ussrs influence even though india military ally80 considerations advocacy expanded economic assistance several voices within eisenhower administration example director former minnesota governor harold stassen influential former advisor jackson timelife publishing business drawing advice economists millikan rostow state department national security council
