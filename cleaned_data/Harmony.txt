rameaus traité lharmonie treatise harmony 1722


publication rameaus traité lharmonie treatise harmony 1722 text discussing musical practice made term title though work earliest record theoretical discussion topic underlying principle behind texts harmony sanctions harmoniousness sounds please conforming certain preestablished compositional principles8
current dictionary definitions attempting give concise descriptions often highlight ambiguity term modern ambiguities tend arise either aesthetic considerations example view pleasing concords harmonious point view musical texture distinguishing harmonic simultaneously sounding pitches contrapuntal successively sounding tones8 words arnold whittall

entire history music theory appears depend distinction harmony counterpoint less evident developments nature musical composition centuries presumed interdependence—at times amounting integration times source sustained tension—between vertical horizontal dimensions musical space


view modern tonal harmony western music began 1600 commonplace music theory usually accounted replacement horizontal contrapuntal writing common music renaissance emphasis vertical element composed music modern theorists however tend unsatisfactory generalisation carl dahlhaus puts

counterpoint supplanted harmony bach’s tonal counterpoint surely less polyphonic palestrina’s modal writing older type counterpoint vertical technique succeeded newer type harmony comprises ‘vertical’ structure chords also ‘horizontal’ movement like music whole harmony process


descriptions definitions harmony harmonic practice show bias towards european western musical traditions example south asian music hindustani carnatic music frequently cited placing little emphasis perceived western practice conventional harmony underlying harmonic foundation south asian music drone held open fifth fourth alter pitch throughout course composition11 pitch simultaneity particular rarely major consideration nevertheless many considerations pitch relevant music theory structure complex system rāgas combines melodic modal considerations codifications within it12
intricate pitch combinations sound simultaneously occur indian classical music—but rarely studied teleological harmonic contrapuntal progressions—as notated western music contrasting emphasis regard indian music particular manifests different methods performance adopted indian music improvisation takes major role structural framework piece13 whereas western music improvisation uncommon since 19th century14 occur western music past improvisation either embellishes prenotated music draws musical models previously established notated compositions therefore uses familiar harmonic schemes15
nevertheless emphasis precomposed european music written theory surrounding shows considerable cultural bias grove dictionary music musicians oxford university press identifies clearly

western culture musics dependent improvisation jazz traditionally regarded inferior music precomposition considered paramount conception musics live oral traditions something composed improvisatory techniques separates higherstanding works notation


evolution harmonic practice language western music facilitated process prior composition permitted study analysis theorists composers alike individual preconstructed works pitches extent rhythms remained unchanged regardless nature performance17
historical rulesedit
traditions western music performance composition theory specific rules harmony rules often described based natural properties pythagorean tunings whole number ratios harmoniousness inherent ratios either perceptually harmonics resonances harmoniousness inherent quality sound allowable pitches harmonies gaining beauty simplicity closeness properties model provides minor seventh major ninth dissonant consonant pythagorean ratios provide rough approximation perceptual harmonicity cannot account cultural factorscitation needed
early western religious music often features parallel perfect intervals intervals would preserve clarity original plainsong works created performed cathedrals made resonant modes respective cathedrals create harmonies polyphony developed however parallel intervals slowly replaced english style consonance used thirds sixthswhen english style considered sweeter sound better suited polyphony offered greater linear flexibility partwriting early music also forbade usage tritone dissonance composers often went considerable lengths musica ficta avoid using newer triadic harmonic system however tritone became permissible standardization functional dissonance made dominant chords desirable
harmony comes notes sounding simultaneously—but work imply harmony melodic line using arpeggios hocket many pieces baroque period solo string instruments—such bachs sonatas partitas solo violin cello—convey subtle harmony inference rather full chordal structures works create sense harmonies using arpeggiated chords implied bass lines implied basslines created notes short duration many listeners perceive bass note chord

carl dahlhaus 1990 distinguishes coordinate subordinate harmony subordinate harmony hierarchical tonality tonal harmony well known today coordinate harmony older medieval renaissance tonalité ancienne term meant signify sonorities linked without giving rise impression goaldirected development first chord forms progression second chord second third former chord progression independent later vice versa coordinate harmony follows direct adjacent relationships rather indirect subordinate interval cycles create symmetrical harmonies extensively used composers alban berg george perle arnold schoenberg béla bartók edgard varèses density
close harmony open harmony close position open position chords respectively voicing music close open harmony
types harmony based upon intervals chords used harmony chords western music based tertian harmony chords built interval thirds chord major7 major third minor third major third types harmony consist quartal quintal harmony
unison considered harmonic interval like fifth third unique identical notes produced together many people sayweasel words harmony must involve intervals like thirds fifths sevenths—but unison counts harmony important especially orchestration music unison singing usually called doubling technique beatles used many earlier recordings type harmony singing unison playing notes often using different musical instruments time commonly called monophonic harmonization

reason numbers dont correctly note counted twice apart categorization intervals also divided consonant dissonant explained following paragraphs consonant intervals produce sensation relaxation dissonant intervals sensation tension tonal music term consonant also means brings resolution degree least whereas dissonance requires resolution
consonant intervals considered perfect unison octave fifth fourth major minor third sixth compound forms interval referred perfect harmonic relationship found natural overtone series namely unison octave fifth fourth basic intervals second third sixth seventh called imperfect harmonic relationships found mathematically exact overtone series classical music perfect fourth bass considered dissonant function contrapuntal intervals second seventh compound forms considered dissonant require resolution produced tension usually preparation depending music style
note effect dissonance perceived relatively within musical context example major seventh interval alone perceived dissonant interval part major seventh chord sound relatively consonant tritone interval fourth step seventh step major scale sounds dissonant alone less within context dominant seventh chord example

western tradition music seventeenth century harmony manipulated using chords combinations pitch classes tertian harmony named interval third members chords found named stacking intervals third starting root third root fifth root third third note chord members named interval root dyads simplest chords contain members power chords
chord three members called triad three members necessarily built thirds quartal quintal harmony chords built intervals depending size intervals stacked different qualities chords formed popular jazz harmony chords named root plus various terms characters indicating qualities keep nomenclature simple possible defaults accepted tabulated example chord members form major triad called default simply chord chord pronounced aflat members
many types music notably baroque romantic modern jazz chords often augmented tensions tension additional chord member creates relatively dissonant interval relation bass following tertian practice building chords stacking thirds simplest first tension added triad stacking existing root third fifth another third fifth giving potentially dissonant member interval seventh away root therefore called seventh chord producing fournote chord called seventh chord
depending widths individual thirds stacked build chord interval root seventh chord major minor diminished interval augmented seventh reproduces root therefore left chordal nomenclature nomenclature allows default indicates chord root third fifth seventh spelled types seventh chords must named explicitly major spelled augmented word augmented applies fifth seventh spelled complete exposition nomenclature chord music

perceptionedit
harmony based consonance concept whose definition changed various times history western music psychological approach consonance continuous variable consonance vary across wide range chord sound consonant various reasons
lack perceptual roughness roughness happens partials frequency components within critical bandwidth measure ears ability separate different frequencies critical bandwidth lies semitones high frequencies becomes larger lower frequencies roughness simultaneous harmonic complex tones depends amplitudes harmonics interval tones roughest interval chromatic scale minor second inversion major seventh typical spectral envelopes central range second roughest interval major second minor seventh followed tritone minor third major sixth major third minor sixth perfect fourth fifth




harmonious major triad composed three tones frequency ratio corresponds approximately real performances however third often larger ratio corresponds interval cents equally tempered major third cents pythagorean third ratio 8164 cents measurements frequencies good performances confirm size major third varies across range even outside without sounding tune thus simple connection frequency ratios harmonic function


second reason perceptual fusion chord fuses perception overall spectrum similar harmonic series according definition major triad fuses better minor triad majorminor seventh chord fuses better majormajor seventh minorminor seventh differences readily apparent tempered contexts explain major triads generally prevalent minor triads majorminor sevenths generally prevalent sevenths spite dissonance tritone interval mainstream tonal music course comparisons depend style
third reason familiarity chords often heard musical contexts tend sound consonant principle explains gradual historical increase harmonic complexity western music example around 1600 unprepared seventh chords gradually became familiar therefore gradually perceived consonant
western music based major minor triads reason chords central consonant terms fusion lack roughness fuse include perfect fourthfifth interval lack roughness lack major minor second intervals combination three tones chromatic scale satisfies criteria
