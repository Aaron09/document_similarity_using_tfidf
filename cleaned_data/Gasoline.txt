first automotive combustion engines socalled otto engines developed last quarter 19th century germany fuel relatively volatile hydrocarbon obtained coal boiling point near octanes boil higher well suited early carburetors evaporators development spray nozzle carburetor enabled less volatile fuels improvements engine efficiency attempted higher compression ratios early attempts blocked knocking premature explosion fuel 1920s antiknock compounds introduced thomas midgley boyd specifically tetraethyllead innovation started cycle improvements fuel efficiency coincided largescale development refining provide products boiling range gasoline 1950s refineries started focus high octane fuels detergents added gasoline clean jets carburetors 1970s witnessed greater attention environmental consequences burning gasoline considerations phasing replacement antiknock compounds subsequently lowsulfur gasoline introduced part preserve catalysts modern exhaust systems4
etymology terminologyedit
gasoline term used north america refer popular automobile fuel oxford english dictionary dates first 1863 spelled gasolene gives derivation word chemical suffixes ene5
however term also influenced trademark cazeline gazeline november 1862 publisher coffee merchant social campaigner john cassell placed advertisement times

patent cazeline safe economical brilliant possesses requisites long desired means powerful artificial light6

earliest occurrence word found cassell discovered shopkeeper dublin named samuel boyd selling counterfeit cazeline wrote stop boyd reply changed every thus coining word gazeline6
petrol preferred term commonwealth countries petrol first used name refined petroleum product around 1870 british wholesaler carless capel leonard marketed solvent7 product later found motor fuel frederick simms associate gottlieb daimler suggested carless register trade mark petrol8 time word already general possibly inspired french pétrole5 registration allowed carless registered number alternative names product petrol became common term fuel british commonwealth910
british refiners originally used motor spirit generic name automotive fuel aviation spirit aviation gasoline carless denied trademark petrol 1930s competitors switched popular name petrol however motor spirit already made laws regulations term remains formal name petrol1112 term used widely nigeria largest petroleum companies call product premium motor spirit13 although petrol made inroads nigerian english premium motor spirit remains formal name used scientific publications government reports newspapers14
word gasoline instead petrol outside north america often confusing shortening gasoline happens often causes confusion various forms used fuel compressed natural liquefied natural liquefied petroleum many countries gasoline colloquial name derived chemical benzene german benzin czech benzín dutch benzine italian benzina russian бензин benzin polish benzyna chilean spanish bencina thai เบนซิน bensin greek βενζίνη venzini romanian benzină swedish bensin arabic بنزين binzīn catalan benzina argentina uruguay paraguay colloquial name nafta derived chemical naphtha15
octane ratingedit
main article octane rating
spark ignition engines designed burn gasoline controlled process called deflagration however unburned mixture autoignite detonating pressure heat alone rather ignite spark plug exactly right time causes rapid pressure rise damage engine often referred engine knocking endgas knock knocking reduced increasing gasolines resistance autoignition expressed octane rating
octane rating measured relative mixture 224trimethylpentane isomer octane nheptane different conventions expressing octane ratings physical fuel several different octane ratings based measure used best known research octane number
octane rating typical commercially available gasoline varies country finland sweden norway standard regular unleaded gasoline also available expensive option ordinary regular unleaded gasoline commonly available premium unleaded gasoline always super unleaded usually 97–98 roncitation needed however shell produce fuel cars highperformance engines 2006 supermarket chain tesco began sell super unleaded gasoline rated octane ratings unleaded fuels vary 8516 91–92 regular 89–90 94–95 midgrade equivalent european regular 90–94 95–99 premium european premium
south africas largest city johannesburg located highveld 1753 metres 5751 level south african recommends octane gasoline petrol altitude octane johannesburg higher altitude lower pressure lower need high octane fuel real performance gain17
octane rating became important military sought higher output aircraft engines late 1930s 1940s higher octane rating allows higher compression ratio supercharger boost thus higher temperatures pressures translate higher power output scientists even predicted nation good supply high octane gasoline would advantage power 1943 rollsroyce merlin aero engine produced 1320 horsepower using fuel modest liter displacement time operation overlord world usaaf conducting operations europe using fuel 100150 avgas obtained adding aniline octane avgas18 time rollsroyce merlin developing 2000 using fuel

highoctanerated fuel liquefied petroleum overall lower power output typical compression ratio engine design optimized gasoline fuel engine tuned fuel higher compression ratios typically improves power output higheroctane fuels allow higher compression ratio without knocking resulting higher cylinder temperature improves efficiency also increased mechanical efficiency created higher compression ratio concomitant higher expansion ratio power stroke greater effect higher expansion ratio extracts work highpressure created combustion process atkinson cycle engine uses timing valve events produce benefits high expansion ratio without disadvantages chiefly detonation high compression ratio high expansion ratio also reasons efficiency diesel engines along elimination pumping losses throttling intake flow
lower energy content liquid volume comparison gasoline mainly lower density lower density property lower molecular weight propane lpgs chief component compared gasolines blend various hydrocarbon compounds heavier molecular weights propane conversely energy content weight higher gasoline higher hydrogen carbon ratio
