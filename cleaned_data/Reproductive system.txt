also sexual reproduction animals
mammals major organs reproductive system include external genitalia penis vulva well number internal organs including gamete producing gonads testicles ovaries diseases human reproductive system common widespread particularly communicable sexually transmitted diseases3
vertebrate animals generally similar reproductive systems consisting gonads ducts openings however great diversity physical adaptations well reproductive strategies every group vertebrates
vertebratesedit
vertebrate animals share elements reproductive systems gameteproducing organs gonads females gonads connected oviducts opening outside body typically cloaca sometimes unique pore vagina intromittent organ
humansedit
main article human reproductive system
human reproductive system usually involves internal fertilization sexual intercourse process male inserts erect penis females vagina ejaculates semen contains sperm sperm travels vagina cervix uterus fallopian tubes fertilization ovum upon successful fertilization implantation gestation fetus occurs within females uterus approximately nine months process known pregnancy humans gestation ends birth process birth known labor labor consists muscles uterus contracting cervix dilating baby passing vagina female genital organ humans babies children nearly helpless require high levels parental care many years important type parental care mammary glands female breasts nurse baby4
female reproductive system functions first produce cells second protect nourish offspring birth male reproductive system function produce deposit sperm humans high level sexual differentiation addition differences nearly every reproductive organ numerous differences typically occur secondary sexual characteristics
maleedit
main article male reproductive system
male reproductive system series organs located outside body around pelvic region male contribute towards reproduction process primary direct function male reproductive system provide male sperm fertilization ovum
major reproductive organs male grouped three categories first category sperm production storage production takes place testes housed temperature regulating scrotum immature sperm travel epididymis development storage second category ejaculatory fluid producing glands include seminal vesicles prostate deferens final category used copulation deposition spermatozoa sperm within female include penis urethra deferens cowpers gland
major secondary sexual characteristics includes larger muscular stature deepened voice facial body hair broad shoulders development adams apple important sexual hormone males androgen particularly testosterone
testes release hormone controls development sperm hormone also responsible development physical characteristics facial hair deep voice
femaleedit
main article female reproductive system
human female reproductive system series organs primarily located inside body around pelvic region female contribute towards reproductive process human female reproductive system contains three main parts vulva leads vagina vaginal opening uterus uterus holds developing fetus ovaries produce females breasts involved parenting stage reproduction classifications considered part female reproductive system
vagina meets outside vulva also includes labia clitoris urethra intercourse area lubricated mucus secreted bartholins glands vagina attached uterus cervix uterus attached ovaries fallopian tubes ovary contains hundreds cells singular ovum
approximately every days pituitary gland releases hormone stimulates develop grow ovum released passes fallopian tube uterus hormones produced ovaries prepare uterus receive ovum sita awaits sperm fertilization occur occur sperm fertilization lining uterus called endometrium unfertilized shed cycle process menstruation ovum fertilized sperm attaches endometrium fetus develops

mammal reproductive systems similar however notable differences nonhuman mammals humans instance male mammals penis stored internally erect penis bone baculum additionally males species remain continually sexually fertile humans like humans groups mammals descended testicles found within scrotum however others descended testicles rest ventral body wall groups mammals elephants undescended testicles found deep within body cavities near kidneys5
reproductive system marsupials unique female vaginae open externally orifice lead different compartments within uterus males usually twopronged penis corresponds females vaginae marsupials typically develop offspring external pouch containing teats newborn young joeys attach post uterine development also marsupials unique prepenial scrotum6 15mm long newborn joey instinctively crawls wriggles several inches clinging mothers pouch

amphibiansedit
main article amphibian reproduction
amphibians exhibit external fertilization eggs typically within water though amphibians caecilians internal fertilization8 paired internal gonads connected ducts cloaca
fishedit
main article fish reproduction
fish exhibit wide range different reproductive strategies fish however oviparous exhibit external fertilization process females cloaca release large quantities gametes called spawn water males release milt white fluid containing many sperm unfertilized eggs species fish oviparous internal fertilization aided pelvic anal fins modified intromittent organ analogous human penis9 small portion fish species either viviparous ovoviviparous collectively known livebearers10
fish gonads typically pairs either ovaries testes fish sexually dimorphic species hermaphroditic unisexual11
invertebratesedit

invertebrates extremely diverse array reproductive systems commonality eggs also aside cephalopods arthropods nearly invertebrates hermaphroditic exhibit external fertilization
cephalopodsedit
main article cephalopod reproduction life cycle
cephalopods sexually dimorphic reproduce laying eggs cephalopods semiinternal fertilization male places gametes inside females mantle cavity pallial cavity fertilize found females single ovary12 likewise male cephalopods single testicle female cephalopods nidamental glands development
penis unshelled male cephalopods coleoidea long muscular gonoduct used transfer spermatophores modified called hectocotylus turn used transfer spermatophores female species hectocotylus missing penis long able extend beyond mantle cavity transfer spermatophores directly female
insectsedit
main article insect reproductive system
insects reproduce oviparously laying eggs eggs produced female pair ovaries sperm produced male testis commonly transmitted female mating means external genitalia sperm stored within female spermathecae time fertilization eggs travel along oviducts fertilized sperm expelled body laid cases ovipositor
arachnidsedit
main article arachnids reproduction
also opiliones penis
arachnids gonads located abdomen genital opening usually located underside second abdominal segment species male transfers sperm female package spermatophore complex courtship rituals evolved many arachnids ensure safe delivery sperm female13
arachnids usually yolky eggs hatch immatures resemble adults scorpions however either ovoviviparous viviparous depending species bear live young
