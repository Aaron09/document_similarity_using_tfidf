electing appointing caliphedit
four rashidun caliphs chosen shura شُـوْرَى process community consultation described form islamic democracy41
fred donner book early islamic conquests 1981 argues standard arabian practice early caliphates prominent kinship group tribe gather leaders death elect leader amongst although specified procedure shura consultative assembly candidates usually lineage deceased leader necessarily sons capable would lead well preferred ineffectual direct heir basis majority sunni view head state governor chosen based lineage alone
argument advanced sunni muslims muhammads companion bakr elected community proper procedure argue caliph ideally chosen election community consensus caliphate became hereditary office prize strongest general rashidun caliphate however sunni muslims believe rightly guided caliphate ended rashidun caliphate
bakr albaqillani said leader muslims simply majority hanifa annu‘man also wrote leader must come majority42
sunni beliefedit
following death muhammad meeting took place saqifah meeting bakr elected caliph muslim community sunni muslims developed belief caliph temporal political ruler appointed rule within bounds islamic rules life allah quran adjudicating orthodoxy islamic left islamic lawyers judiciary specialists individually termed mujtahids collectively named ulema first four caliphs called rashidun meaning rightly guided caliphs believed followed quran sunnah example muhammad things
