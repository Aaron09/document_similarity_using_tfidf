benefitsedit
benefits fptp concept easy understand ballots easily counted processed preferential voting systems
supporters argue electoral method provides best governance trading fairness representation responsible government tendency produce majority rule allows government pursue consistent strategy term office make decisions correct unpopular6
tony blair defending fptp argued systems give small parties balance power influence disproportionate votes7
allowing people parliament finish first constituency described david cameron creating parliament full secondchoices really wanted didnt really object either8 winston churchill criticised electoral outcomes alternative vote determined worthless votes given worthless candidates9
supporters also argue electoral systems using proportional representation often enable smaller parties become decisive parliament thus gaining power leverage government fptp generally reduces likelihood except parties strong regional basis1011
criticismsedit
tactical votingedit
greater extent many others firstpastthepost method encourages tactical voting voters incentive vote candidate predict likely preference preferred candidate unlikely vote could considered wasted
position sometimes summarised extreme form votes anyone runnerup votes winnercitation needed votes candidates deny potential support secondplaced candidate might otherwise following extremely close 2000 presidential election supporters democratic candidate gore believed reason lost republican george bush portion electorate voted ralph nader green party exit polls indicated would preferred gore bush 2712 election ultimately determined results florida bush prevailed gore margin votes 0009 exceeded 97488 1635 votes nader
puerto rico tendency independentista voters support populares candidates phenomenon responsible popular victories even though estadistas voters island widely recognised puerto ricans sometimes call independentistas vote populares melons fruit green outside inside reference party colors
voters predict advance candidates results significantly distorted

voters vote based view others vote well changing originally intended vote
substantial power given media voters believe assertions leading contenders likely even voters distrust media know others believe media therefore candidates receive media attention probably popular
candidate track record might otherwise supported majority voters considered unlikely thus lose votes tactical voting
method promote votes opposed votes example entire campaigns organised voting conservative party voting either labour liberal democrat depending seen best placed locality behaviour difficult measure objectively

proponents voting methods singlemember districts argue would reduce need tactical voting reduce spoiler effect examples include preferential voting systems instant runoff voting well tworound system runoffs less tested methods approval voting condorcet methods

sachss price civilization 201113

duvergers rarely seen reality firstpastthepost elections resulting multiparty legislatures united states major exception1415 counterforce duvergers national level plurality system encourage parties individual constituencies supermajorities lead vote fracturing16
wasted votesedit
wasted votes seen cast losing candidates winning candidates excess number required victory example general election 2005 votes cast losing candidates excess votes total wasted votes basis large majority votes play part determining outcome winnertakesall system reasons voter participation tends lower countries fptp elsewhere17
gerrymanderingedit
main article gerrymandering
fptp permits many wasted votes election fptp easily gerrymandered gerrymandering electoral areas designed deliberately unfairly increase number seats party redrawing party small number districts overwhelming majority votes large number districts smaller disadvantage
manipulation chargesedit
presence spoilers often gives rise suspicions manipulation slate taken place spoiler received incentives spoiler also drop last moment inducing charges intended beginning
smaller parties reduce success largest similar partyedit
firstpastthepost small party draw votes away larger party similar therefore give advantage another less similar large party
safe seatsedit
firstpastthepost within geographical areas tends deliver particularly larger parties significant number safe seats representative sheltered dramatic change voting behaviour electoral reform society estimates half seats considered safe18 claimed involved 2009 expenses scandal significantly likely hold safe seat1920
however voting systems notably partlist system also create politicians relatively immune electoral pressure
distorted geographical representationedit
winnertakesall nature fptp leads distorted patterns representation since party support commonly correlated geography example conservative party represents rural seats south country labour party cities north means even popular parties find without elected politicians significant parts country leaving supporters nevertheless significant minority unrepresented21
impact party policy campaigningedit
suggested distortions geographical representation provide incentives parties ignore interests areas weak stand much chance gaining representation leading governments govern national interest election campaigns campaigning activity parties tends focus marginal seats prospect change representation leaving safer areas excluded participation active campaign22 political parties operate targeting directing activists policy proposals toward areas considered marginal additional vote value2324
voting method criteriaedit
scholars rate voting methods using mathematically derived voting method criteria describe desirable features method ranked preference method meet criteria mutually exclusive shown results arrows impossibility theorem gibbard–satterthwaite theorem25
majority criterionedit
majority criterion states candidate preferred majority voters candidate must win26 firstpastthepost meets criterion though converse candidate need votes order although criterion constituency vote adding total votes winning party parliament
condorcet winner criterionedit
