oceanic zones




major oceanic zones based depth biophysical conditions


oceanographers divide ocean different vertical zones defined physical biological conditions pelagic zone includes open ocean regions divided regions categorized depth light abundance photic zone includes oceans surface depth region photosynthesis occur therefore biodiverse plants require photosynthesis life found deeper photic zone must either rely material sinking marine snow find another energy source hydrothermal vents primary source energy known aphotic zone depths exceeding pelagic part photic zone known epipelagic
pelagic part aphotic zone divided vertical regions according temperature mesopelagic uppermost region lowermost boundary thermocline tropics generally lies 700–1000 meters 2300–3300 next bathypelagic lying typically 700–1000 meters 2300–3300 2000–4000 meters 6600–13100 lying along abyssal plain abyssopelagic whose lower boundary lies 6000 meters 20000 last zone includes deep oceanic trench known hadalpelagic lies 6000–11000 meters 20000–36000 deepest oceanic zone
benthic zones aphotic correspond three deepest zones deepsea bathyal zone covers continental slope 4000 meters 13000 abyssal zone covers abyssal plains 4000 6000 lastly hadal zone corresponds hadalpelagic zone found oceanic trenches
pelagic zone subdivided subregions neritic zone oceanic zone neritic zone encompasses water mass directly continental shelves whereas oceanic zone includes completely open water
contrast littoral zone covers region high tide represents transitional area marine terrestrial conditions also known intertidal zone area tide level affects conditions region
ocean divided three density zones surface zone pycnocline deep zone surface zone also called mixed layer refers uppermost density zone ocean temperature salinity relatively constant depth zone currents wave action surface zone contains ocean water contact atmosphere within photic zone surface zone oceans least dense water represents approximately total volume ocean water surface zone usually ranges depths feet 3300 feet 1000 ocean surface vary great deal cases surface zone entirely nonexistent surface zone typically thicker tropics regions higher latitude transition colder denser water abrupt tropics regions higher latitudes pycnocline refers zone wherein density substantially increases depth primarily decreases temperature pycnocline effectively separates lowerdensity surface zone higherdensity deep zone pycnocline represents approximately total volume ocean water deep zone refers lowermost density zone ocean deep zone usually begins depths 3300 feet 1000 midlatitudes deep zone undergoes negligible changes water density depth deep zone represents approximately total volume ocean water deep zone contains relatively colder stable water
zone undergoes dramatic changes temperature depth contains thermocline tropical thermocline typically deeper thermocline higher latitudes polar waters receive relatively little solar energy stratified temperature generally lack thermocline surface water polar latitudes nearly cold water greater depths thermocline water cold ranging deep cold layer contains bulk ocean water average temperature world ocean °ccitation needed zone undergoes dramatic changes salinity depth contains halocline zone undergoes strong vertical chemistry gradient depth contains chemocline

climate




global thermohaline circulation blue represent deepwater currents whereas represent surface currents


ocean currents greatly affect earths climate transferring heat tropics polar regions transferring warm cold precipitation coastal regions winds carry inland surface heat freshwater fluxes create global density gradients drive thermohaline circulation part largescale ocean circulation plays important role supplying heat polar regions thus regulation changes thermohaline circulation thought significant impacts earths energy budget thermohaline circulation governs rate deep waters reach surface also significantly influence atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
