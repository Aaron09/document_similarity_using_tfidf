reforms council trentedit
council trent believed apex counterreformations influence church music 16th century however councils pronouncements music first attempt reform catholic church spoken perceived abuse music used mass council trent ever convened discuss music 1562 manipulation credo using nonliturgical songs addressed 1503 secular singing intelligibility text delivery psalmody 149229 delegates council link long chain church clergy pushed reform musical liturgy reaching back 132230
probably extreme move reform came late 1562 instructed legates egidio foscarari bishop modena gabriele paleotti archbishop bologna began work reforming religious orders practices involving liturgy31 reforms prescribed cloisters nuns included omitting organclarification needed prohibiting professional musicians banishing polyphonic singing much strict councils edicts even found palestrina legend32
fueling reform many ecclesial figures compositional technique popular 15th 16th centuries using musical material even accompanying texts compositions motets madrigals chansons several voices singing different texts different languages made text difficult distinguish mixture words notes parody mass would contain melodies usually tenor line words songs could often sensual subjects33 musical liturgy church influenced secular tunes styles council paris 1528 well council trent making attempts restore sense sacredness church setting appropriate mass councils simply responding issues day34
reforms 22nd sessionedit
council trent sporadically december 1545 december 1563 reform many parts catholic church 22nd session council 1562 dealt church music canon section abuses sacrifice mass meeting council september 156235
canon states since sacred mysteries celebrated utmost reverence deepest feeling toward alone external worship truly suitable becoming others filled devotion called religion everything regulated masses whether celebrated plain voice song everything clearly quickly executed reach ears hearers quietly penetrate hearts masses measured music organ customary nothing profane intermingled hymns divine praises something divine service sung organ service proceeds first recited simple clear voice lest reading sacred words imperceptible entire manner singing musical modes calculated afford vain delight words comprehensible thus hearts listeners caught desire celestial harmonies contemplation joys blessed36
canon often quoted council trents decree church music glaring misunderstanding canon proposed decree fact delegates council never officially accepted canon popular form bishops granada coimbra segovia pushed long statement music attenuated many prelates council joined enthusiastically37 restrictions actually given 22nd session keep secular elements music making polyphony implicitly allowed38 issue textual intelligibility make final edicts 22nd session featured preliminary debates39 22nd session prohibited lascivious profane things intermingled music paleotti acts brings equal importance issues intelligibility40
idea council called remove polyphony church widespread documentary evidence support claim possible however fathers proposed measure41 emperor ferdinand holy roman emperor attributed saviour church music said polyphony ought driven church ferdinand likely alarmist read council possibility total polyphony42 council trent focus style music attitudes worship reverence mass43
saviourlegendedit
crises regarding polyphony intelligibility text threat polyphony removed completely assumed coming council dramatic legend resolution legend goes giovanni pierluigi palestrina 152526–1594 church musician choirmaster rome wrote mass council delegates order demonstrate polyphonic composition could text words could clearly understood still pleasing palestrinas missa papae marcelli mass pope marcellus performed council received welcoming reception among delegates completely changed minds allowed polyphony stay musical liturgy therefore palestrina came named saviour church polyphony legend though unfounded long mainstay histories music44 saviourmyth first spread account aggazzari banchieri 1609 said pope marcellus trying replace polyphony plainsong45 palestrinas missa papae marcelli though 1564 22nd session performed pope reforms considered sistine choir
pope marcellus mass short important help save church polyphony46 undeniable despite solid evidence influence council trent figure qualified represent cause polyphony mass palestrina47 pope pius upon hearing palestrinas music would make palestrina papal brief model future generations catholic composers sacred music48
reforms following council trentedit
like contemporary palestrina flemish composer jacobus kerle 153132–1591 also credited giving model composition council trent composition fourparts preces marks official turning point counter reformations cappella ideal49 kerle ranking composer netherlands acted conformity council50 another musical giant equal standing palestrina orlando lasso 153032–1594 important figure music history though less purist palestrina51 expressed sympathy councils concerns still showed favor parady chanson masses52
despite dearth edicts council regarding polyphony textual clarity reforms followed 22nd session filled gaps left council stylistic areas 24th session council gave authority provincial synods discern provisions church music53 decision leave practical application stylistic matters local ecclesiastical leaders important shaping future catholic church music54 left local church leaders church musicians find proper application councils decrees55
though originally theological directed towards attitudes musicians councils decrees came thought church musicians pronouncement proper musical styles56 understanding likely spread musicians sought implement councils declarations read official tridentine pronouncements church musicians probably influenced order ecclesiastical patrons57 composers reference councils reforms prefaces compositions adequately claim musical basis council spiritual religious basis art58
cardinal archbishop milan charles borromeo important figure reforming church music council trent though borromeo aide pope rome unable milan eagerly pushed decrees council quickly practice milan59 borromeo kept contact church milian letters eagerly encouraged leaders implement reforms coming council trent letters vicar milan diocese nicolo ormaneto verona borromeo commissioned master chapel vincenzo ruffo 1508–1587 write mass would make words easy understand possible borromeo also suggested nicola composer chromatic style milan could compose mass compared textural clarity60 borromeo likely involved heard questions regarding textual clarity request ruffo
ruffo took borromeos commission seriously compose style presented text words would intelligible textual meaning important part composition approach move voices homorhythmic manner complicated rhythms dissonance conservatively ruffos approach certainly success textual clarity simplicity music theoretically pure artistic success despite ruffos attempts bring interest monotonous fourpart texture61 ruffos compositional style favored text well line councils perceived concern intelligibility thus belief councils strong edicts regarding textual intelligibility became characterize development sacred church music
effects council trent counterreformation also paved ruthenian orthodox christians return full communion roman catholic church preserving byzantine tradition pope clement viii received ruthenian bishops full communion february 159662 treaty union brest rome recognized ruthenians continued practice byzantine liturgical tradition married clergy consecration bishops within ruthenian christian tradition moreover treaty specifically exempts ruthenians accepting filioque clause purgatory condition reconciliation63
council trent brought changes music notably developing missa brevis lauda spiritual madrigal madrigali spirituali
