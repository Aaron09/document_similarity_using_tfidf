computing curricula 20051 defined computing follows

general define computing mean goaloriented activity requiring benefiting creating computers thus computing includes designing building hardware software systems wide range purposes processing structuring managing various kinds information scientific studies using computers making computer systems behave intelligently creating using communications entertainment media finding gathering information relevant particular purpose list virtually endless possibilities vast

defines five subdisciplines computing field computer science computer engineering information systems information technology software engineering2
however computing curricula 20051 also recognizes meaning computing depends context

computing also meanings specific based context term used example information systems specialist view computing somewhat differently software engineer regardless context computing well complicated difficult society needs people computing well must think computing profession also discipline

term computing sometimes narrowly defined 1989 report computing discipline3

discipline computing systematic study algorithmic processes describe transform information theory analysis design efficiency implementation application fundamental question underlying computing efficiently automated

term computing also synonymous counting calculating earlier times used reference action performed mechanical computing machines human computers
