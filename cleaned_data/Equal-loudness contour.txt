experimental determinationedit
human auditory system sensitive frequencies maximum around 22000 although upper hearing limit decreases within range human sensitive largely resonance canal transfer function ossicles middle
fletcher munson first measured equalloudness contours using headphones 1933 study test subjects listened pure tones various frequencies increments stimulus intensity frequency intensity listener also listened reference tone 1000 fletcher munson adjusted reference tone listener perceived loudness test tone loudness psychological quantity difficult measure fletcher munson averaged results many test subjects derive reasonable averages lowest equalloudness contour represents quietest audible tone—the absolute threshold hearing highest contour threshold pain
churcher king carried second determination 1937 results fletcher munsons showed considerable discrepancies parts auditory diagram1
