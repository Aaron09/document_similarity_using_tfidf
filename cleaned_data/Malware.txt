malware categories march 2011


many early infectious programs including first internet worm written experiments pranks today malware used black hackers governments steal personal financial business information56
malware sometimes used broadly government corporate websites gather guarded information7 disrupt operation general however malware used individuals gain information personal identification numbers details bank credit card numbers passwords
since rise widespread broadband internet access malicious software frequently designed profit since 2003 majority widespread viruses worms designed take control users computers illicit purposes8 infected zombie computers used send email spam host contraband data child pornography9 engage distributed denialofservice attacks form extortion10
programs designed monitor users browsing display unsolicited advertisements redirect affiliate marketing revenues called spyware spyware programs spread like viruses instead generally installed exploiting security holes also hidden packaged together unrelated userinstalled software11
ransomware affects infected computer demands payment reverse damage example programs cryptolocker encrypt files securely decrypt payment substantial money
malware used generate money click fraud making appear computer user clicked advertising link site generating payment advertiser estimated 2012 active malware used kind click fraud adclicks fraudulent12
addition criminal moneymaking malware used sabotage often political motives stuxnet example designed disrupt specific industrial equipment politically motivated attacks spread shut large computer networks including massive deletion files corruption master boot records described computer killing attacks made sony pictures entertainment november 2014 using malware known shamoon w32disttrack saudi aramco august 20121314
infectious malwareedit
main articles computer virus computer worm
bestknown types malware viruses worms known manner spread rather specific types behavior computer virus software embeds executable software including operating system target system without users consent virus spread executables hand worm standalone malware software actively transmits network infect computers definitions lead observation virus requires user infected software operating system virus spread whereas worm spreads itself15
concealmentedit
categories mutually exclusive malware multiple techniques16 section applies malware designed operate undetected sabotage ransomware
also polymorphic packer
virusesedit
main article computer virus
computer virus software usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program produce copies insert programs files usually performs malicious action destroying data17 example infection technique usually used spread malware inserts extra data executable code files18
lockscreensedit
main article ransomware
lockscreens screen lockers type “cyber police” ransomware blocks screens windows android devices false accusation harvesting illegal content trying scare victims paying fee19 jisut slocker impact android devices lockscreens jisut making nearly percent android ransomware detections20
trojan horsesedit
main article trojan horse computing
trojan horse malicious software misrepresents appear useful routine interesting order persuade victim install term derived ancient greek story trojan horse used invade city troy stealth2122232425
trojan horses generally spread form social engineering example user duped executing email attachment disguised unsuspicious routine form filled driveby download although payload anything many modern forms backdoor contacting controller unauthorized access affected computer26 trojan horses backdoors easily detectable computers appear slower heavy processor network usage
unlike computer viruses worms trojan horses generally attempt inject files otherwise propagate themselves27
spring 2017 users version proton remote access trojan rat28 trained extract password data various sources browser autofill data macos keychain password vaults29
rootkitsedit
main article rootkit
malicious software installed system essential stays concealed avoid detection software packages known rootkits allow concealment modifying hosts operating system malware hidden user rootkits prevent malicious process visible systems list processes keep files read30
malicious software contains routines defend removal merely hide early example behavior recorded jargon file tale pair programs infesting xerox time sharing system

ghostjob would detect fact killed would start copy recently stopped program within milliseconds kill ghosts kill simultaneously difficult deliberately crash system31

backdoorsedit
main article backdoor computing
backdoor method bypassing normal authentication procedures usually connection network internet system compromised backdoors installed order allow access future32 invisibly user
idea often suggested computer manufacturers preinstall backdoors systems provide technical support customers never reliably verified reported 2014 government agencies diverting computers purchased considered targets secret workshops software hardware permitting remote access agency installed considered among productive operations obtain access networks around world33 backdoors installed trojan horses worms implants methods3435
evasionedit
since beginning 2015 sizable portion malware utilizes combination many techniques designed avoid detection analysis36

common evasion technique malware evades analysis detection fingerprinting environment executed37
second common evasion technique confusing automated tools detection methods allows malware avoid detection technologies signaturebased antivirus software changing server used malware38
third common evasion technique timingbased evasion malware runs certain times following certain actions taken user executes certain vulnerable periods boot process remaining dormant rest time
fourth common evasion technique done obfuscating internal data automated tools detect malware39
increasingly common technique adware uses stolen certificates disable antimalware virus protection technical remedies available deal adware40

nowadays sophisticated stealthy ways evasion information hiding techniques namely stegomalware
vulnerabilityedit
main article vulnerability computing

context throughout called system attack anything single application complete computer operating system large network
various factors make system vulnerable malware


security defects softwareedit
malware exploits security defects security bugs vulnerabilities design operating system applications browsers older versions microsoft internet explorer supported windows xp41 vulnerable versions browser plugins adobe flash player adobe acrobat reader java se4243 sometimes even installing versions plugins automatically uninstall versions security advisories plugin providers announce securityrelated updates44 common vulnerabilities assigned listed national vulnerability database secunia psi45 example software free personal check vulnerable outofdate software attempt update
malware authors target bugs loopholes exploit common method exploitation buffer overrun vulnerability software designed store data specified region memory prevent data buffer accommodate supplied malware provide data overflows buffer malicious executable code data payload accessed attacker legitimate software determines
insecure design user erroredit
early booted floppy disks builtin hard drives became common operating system normally started possible boot another boot device available floppy disk cdrom dvdrom flash drive network common configure computer boot devices available normally none would available user would intentionally insert optical drive boot computer special example install operating system even without booting computers configured execute software media soon become available autorun device inserted
malicious software distributors would trick user booting running infected device medium example virus could make infected computer autorunnable code stick plugged anyone attached stick another computer autorun would turn become infected also pass infection way46 generally device plugs port even lights fans speakers toys peripherals digital microscope used spread malware devices infected manufacturing supply quality control inadequate46
form infection largely avoided setting computers default boot internal hard drive available autorun devices46 intentional booting another device always possible pressing certain keys boot
older email software would automatically open html email containing potentially malicious javascript code users also execute disguised malicious email attachments infected executable files supplied wayscitation needed
overprivileged users overprivileged codeedit
main article principle least privilege
computing privilege refers much user program allowed modify system poorly designed computer systems users programs assigned privileges malware take advantage ways malware overprivileged users overprivileged code
systems allow users modify internal structures users today would considered overprivileged users standard operating procedure early microcomputer home computer systems distinction administrator root regular user system systems nonadministrator users overprivileged design sense allowed modify internal structures system environments users overprivileged inappropriately granted administrator equivalent status
systems allow code executed user access rights user known overprivileged code also standard operating procedure early microcomputer home computer systems malware running overprivileged code privilege subvert system almost currently popular operating systems also many scripting applications allow code many privileges usually sense user executes code system allows code rights user makes users vulnerable malware form email attachments disguised
operating systemedit

homogeneity vulnerability example computers network operating system upon exploiting worm exploit all47 particular microsoft windows large share market exploited vulnerability concentrating either operating system could subvert large number systems introducing diversity purely sake robustness adding linux computers could increase shortterm costs training maintenance however long nodes part directory service authentication diverse nodes could deter total shutdown network allow nodes help recovery infected nodes separate functional redundancy could avoid cost total shutdown cost increased complexity reduced usability terms single signon authentication

antimalware strategiesedit
main article antivirus software
malware attacks become frequent attention begun shift viruses spyware protection malware protection programs specifically developed combat malware preventive recovery measures backup recovery methods mentioned computer virus article
antivirus antimalware softwareedit
specific component antivirus antimalware software commonly referred onaccess realtime scanner hooks deep operating systems core kernel functions manner similar certain malware would attempt operate though users informed permission protecting system time operating system accesses file onaccess scanner checks file legitimate file file identified malware scanner access operation stopped file dealt scanner predefined antivirus program configured duringpost installation user notifiedcitation needed considerable performance impact operating system though degree impact dependent well scanner programmed goal stop operations malware attempt system occur including activities might exploit bugs trigger unexpected operating system behavior
antimalware programs combat malware ways

provide real time protection installation malware software computer type malware protection works antivirus protection antimalware software scans incoming network data malware blocks threats comes across
antimalware software programs used solely detection removal malware software already installed onto computer type antimalware software scans contents windows registry operating system files installed programs computer provide list threats found allowing user choose files delete keep compare list list known malware components removing files match48

realtime protection malware works identically realtime antivirus protection software scans disk files download time blocks activity components known represent malware cases also intercept attempts install startup items modify browser settings many malware components installed result browser exploits user error using security software antimalware though many sandbox browsers essentially isolate browser computer hence malware induced change also effective helping restrict damage donecitation needed
examples microsoft windows antivirus antimalware software include optional microsoft security essentials49 windows vista windows realtime protection windows malicious software removal tool50 included windows security updates patch tuesday second tuesday month windows defender optional download case windows incorporating functionality case windows later51 additionally several capable antivirus software programs available free download internet usually restricted noncommercial use52 tests found free programs competitive commercial ones52 microsofts system file checker used check repair corrupted system files
viruses disable system restore important windows tools task manager command prompt many viruses removed rebooting computer entering windows safe mode networking53 using system tools microsoft safety scanner54
hardware implants type general detect
website security scansedit
malware also harms compromised websites breaking reputation blacklisting search engines websites offer vulnerability scanning55565758 scans check website detect malware note outdated software report known security issues
isolation parallel networkedit
last resort computers protected malware infected computers prevented disseminating trusted information imposing completely disconnecting networks however malware still cross situations example removable media carry malware across december 2013 researchers germany showed apparent defeated59
airhopper60 bitwhisper61 gsmem fansmitter four techniques introduced researchers leak data airgapped computers using electromagnetic thermal acoustic emissions
graywareedit
also privacyinvasive software potentially unwanted program
grayware term applied unwanted applications files classified malware worsen performance computers cause security risks64
describes applications behave annoying undesirable manner less serious troublesome malware grayware encompasses spyware adware fraudulent dialers joke programs remote access tools unwanted programs harm performance computers cause inconvenience term came around 200465
another term potentially unwanted program potentially unwanted application pua66 refers applications would considered unwanted despite often downloaded user possibly failing read download agreement pups include spyware adware fraudulent dialers many security products classify unauthorised generators grayware although frequently carry true malware addition ostensible purpose
software maker malwarebytes lists several criteria classifying program pup67 adware using stolen certificates disables antimalware virus protection technical remedies available40
history viruses wormsedit
internet access became widespread viruses spread personal computers infecting executable boot sectors floppy disks inserting copy machine code instructions executables virus causes whenever program disk booted early computer viruses written apple macintosh became widespread dominance msdos system executableinfecting viruses dependent users exchanging software bootable floppies thumb drives spread rapidly computer hobbyist circlescitation needed
first worms networkborne infectious programs originated personal computers multitasking unix systems first wellknown worm internet worm 1988 infected sunos systems unlike virus worm insert programs instead exploited security holes vulnerabilities network server programs started running separate process68 behavior used todays worms wellcitation needed69
rise microsoft windows platform 1990s flexible macros applications became possible write infectious code macro language microsoft word similar programs macro viruses infect documents templates rather applications executables rely fact macros word document form executable code70
academic researchedit
main article malware research
notion selfreproducing computer program traced back initial theories operation complex automata71 john neumann showed theory program could reproduce constituted plausibility result computability theory fred cohen experimented computer viruses confirmed neumanns postulate investigated properties malware detectability selfobfuscation using rudimentary encryption doctoral dissertation subject computer viruses72 combination cryptographic technology part payload virus exploiting attack purposes initialized investigated 1990s includes initial ransomware evasion ideas73
