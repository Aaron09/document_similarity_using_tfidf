common featuresedit
whether genetic unity factor occasional contact typologically australian languages form language area sprachbund sharing much vocabulary many distinctive phonological features across entire continent
common feature many australian languages display socalled avoidance speech special speech registers used presence certain close relatives registers share phonology grammar standard language lexicon different usually restricted also commonly speech taboos extended periods mourning initiation numerous aboriginal sign languages
morphosyntactic alignment many australian languages ergative–absolutive case systems typically split systems widespread pattern pronouns first second persons nominative–accusative case marking third person ergative–absolutive though splits animate inanimate also found languages persons accusative ergative inflections second person thirdperson human tripartite marked overtly either ergative accusative transitive clauses marked either intransitive clauses also languages employ nominative–accusative case markingcitation needed
phonetics phonologyedit
segmental inventoryedit
typical australian phonological inventory includes three vowels usually occur long short variants cases unrounded give
almost never voicing contrast consonant sound like beginning word like vowels either symbol could often chosen represent australia also stands almost entirely free fricative consonants even cases fricatives occur developed recently lenition weakening stops therefore nonsibilants like rather sibilants like common elsewhere world languages also three rhotics typically flap trill approximant like combined rhotics english spanish
besides lack fricatives striking feature australian speech sounds large number places articulation nearly every language four places coronal region either phonemically allophonically accomplished variables position tongue front back shape pointed flat also bilabial velar often palatal consonants complete absence uvular glottal consonants stops nasals occur places languages laterals occur four coronal places
language displays full range stops laterals kalkatungu labial dental alveolar retroflex palatal velar wangganguru well three rhotics yanyuwa even contrasts additional true dorsopalatal series plus prenasalized consonants seven places articulation addition four laterals
notable exception generalizations kalaw lagaw inventory like papuan neighbours languages australian mainland including full voice contrasts dental alveolar sibilants allophonic variation respectively velar well rhotic lateral three nasals labial dental velar contrast places articulation stopssibilants vowels concerned vowels morphosyntactic well phonemic length contrasts glides distinguish origin vowels origin consonants kunjen neighbouring languages also developed contrasting aspirated consonants found south
