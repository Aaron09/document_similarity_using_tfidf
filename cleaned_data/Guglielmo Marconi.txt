radio workedit
early years marconi interest science electricity early 1890s began working idea wireless telegraphy—ie transmission telegraph messages without connecting wires used electric telegraph idea numerous investigators inventors exploring wireless telegraph technologies even building systems using electric conduction electromagnetic induction optical light signalling years none proven technically commercially successful relatively development came heinrich hertz 1888 demonstrated could produce detect electromagnetic radiation time commonly called hertzian waves generally referred radio waves19
great deal interest radio waves physics community interest radio scientific phenomenon potential communication method physicists generally looked radio waves invisible form light short range phenomenon could travel along line sight path thus range limited visual horizon like existing forms visual signaling making unsuitable long distance communication20 hertzs death 1894 brought published reviews earlier discoveries including demonstration transmission detection radio waves british physicist oliver lodge article hertzs work marconis teacher augusto righi righis article renewed marconis interest developing wireless telegraphy system based radio waves21 line inquiry marconi noted inventors seem pursuing8
developing radio telegraphyedit




marconis first transmitter incorporating monopole antenna consisted elevated copper sheet connected righi spark left powered induction coil center telegraph right switch spell text messages morse code


marconi twenty years began conduct experiments radio waves building much equipment attic home villa griffone pontecchio administrative subdivision sasso marconi italy help butler mignani built hertzs original experiments suggestion righi began using coherer early detector based 1890 findings french physicist edouard branly used lodges experiments changed resistance exposed radio waves22 summer 1894 built storm alarm made battery coherer electric bell went picked radio waves generated lightning
continued work attic late night december 1894 demonstrated radio transmitter receiver mother setup made bell ring side room pushing telegraphic button bench2322 financed father marconi continued read literature picked ideas physicists experimenting radio waves great deal develop devices portable transmitters receiver systems could work long distances8 turning essentially laboratory experiment useful communication system24 marconi came functional system many components25

relatively simple oscillator sparkproducing radio transmitter
wire metal sheet capacity area suspended height ground
coherer receiver modification edouard branlys original device refinements increase sensitivity reliability
telegraph operate transmitter send short long pulses corresponding dotsanddashes morse code
telegraph register activated coherer recorded received morse code dots dashes onto roll paper tape

summer 1895 marconi moved experimentation outdoors continued experiment fathers estate bologna tried different arrangements shapes antenna even improvements able transmit signals half mile distance oliver lodge predicted 1894 maximum transmission distance radio waves
transmission breakthroughedit
breakthrough came summer marconi found much greater range could achieved raised height antenna borrowing technique used wired telegraphy grounding transmitter receiver improvements system capable transmitting signals miles hills2627 monopole antenna reduced frequency waves compared dipole antennas used hertz radiated vertically polarized radio waves could travel longer distances point concluded device could become capable spanning greater distances additional funding research would prove valuable commercially militarily marconis experimental apparatus proved first engineeringcomplete commercially successful radio transmission system282930
marconi wrote ministry post telegraphs direction pietro lacava explaining wireless telegraph machine asking funding never received response letter eventually dismissed minister wrote longara document referring insane asylum della lungara rome31
1896 marconi spoke family friend carlo gardini honorary consul united states consulate bologna leaving italy england gardini wrote letter introduction ambassador italy london annibale ferrero explaining marconi extraordinary discoveries response ambassador ferrero advised reveal results obtained patents also encouraged come england believed would easier find necessary funds convert findings marconis experiment practical finding little interest appreciation work italy marconi travelled london early 1896 accompanied mother seek support work spoke fluent english addition italian marconi arrived dover customs officer opened case find various apparatus customs officer immediately contacted admiralty london marconi gained interest support william preece chief electrical engineer british post office
