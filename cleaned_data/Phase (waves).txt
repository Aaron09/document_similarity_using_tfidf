phase difference difference expressed degrees time waves frequency referenced point time2 oscillators frequency phase difference said phase oscillators frequency different phases phase difference oscillators said phase
amount oscillators phase expressed degrees 360° radians phase difference degrees radians oscillators said antiphase interacting waves meet point antiphase destructive interference occur common waves electromagnetic light acoustic sound energy become superposed transmission medium happens phase difference determines whether reinforce weaken complete cancellation possible waves equal amplitudes
time sometimes used instead angle express position within cycle oscillation phase difference analogous athletes running around race track speed direction starting different positions track pass point different instants time time difference phase difference constant every pass since speed direction different speeds different frequencies phase difference undefined would reflect different starting positions technically phase difference entities various frequencies undefined exist

time zones also analogous phase differences

phase comparisonedit
phase comparison comparison phase waveforms usually nominal frequency time frequency purpose phase comparison generally determine frequency offset difference wave cycles respect reference1
phase comparison made connecting signals twochannel oscilloscope oscilloscope display sine waves shown graphic right adjacent image sine wave test frequency bottom sine wave represents signal reference
frequencies exactly phase relationship would change would appear stationary oscilloscope display since frequencies exactly reference appears stationary test signal moves measuring rate motion test signal offset frequencies determined
vertical lines drawn points sine wave passes zero bottom figure shows bars whose width represents phase difference signals case phase difference increasing indicating test signal lower frequency reference1
