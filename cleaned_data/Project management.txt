swot analysis strengths weaknesses opportunities threats business

planningedit
initiation stage project planned appropriate level detail example flowchart30 main purpose plan time cost resources adequately estimate work needed effectively manage risk project execution initiation process group failure adequately plan greatly reduces projects chances successfully accomplishing goals
project planning generally consists of32

determining plan level detail rolling wave planning
developing scope statement
selecting planning team
identifying deliverables creating work breakdown structure
identifying activities needed complete deliverables networking activities logical sequence
estimating resource requirements activities
estimating time cost activities
developing schedule
developing budget
risk planning
developing quality assurance measures
gaining formal approval begin work

additional processes planning communications scope management identifying roles responsibilities determining purchase project holding kickoff meeting also generally advisable
product development projects conceptual design operation final product performed concurrent project planning activities help inform planning team identifying deliverables planning activities
