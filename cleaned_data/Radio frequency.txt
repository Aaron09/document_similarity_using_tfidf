special properties currentedit
electric currents oscillate radio frequencies special properties shared direct current alternating current lower frequencies

energy currents conductors radiate space electromagnetic waves radio waves basis radio technology
current penetrate deeply electrical conductors tends flow along surfaces known skin effect
currents applied body often cause painful sensation muscular contraction electric shock lower frequency currents produce34 current changes direction quickly trigger depolarization nerve membranes however mean currents harmless cause internal injury well serious superficial burns called burns
current easily ionize creating conductive path property exploited high frequency units used electric welding currents higher frequencies power distribution uses
another property ability appear flow paths contain insulating material like dielectric insulator capacitor capacitive reactance circuit decreases frequency
contrast current blocked coil wire even single turn bend wire inductive reactance circuit increases frequency
conducted ordinary electric cable current tendency reflect discontinuities cable connectors travel back cable toward source causing condition called standing waves therefore current must carried specialized types cable called transmission line

radio communicationedit
receive radio signals antenna must used however since antenna pick thousands radio signals time radio tuner necessary tune particular frequency frequency range5 typically done resonator simplest form circuit capacitor inductor form tuned circuit resonator amplifies oscillations within particular frequency band reducing oscillations frequencies outside band another method isolate particular radio frequency oversampling gets wide range frequencies picking frequencies interest done software defined radio
distance radio communications useful depends significantly things wavelength transmitter power receiver quality type size height antenna mode transmission noise interfering signals ground waves tropospheric scatter skywaves achieve greater ranges lineofsight propagation study radio propagation allows estimates useful range made
