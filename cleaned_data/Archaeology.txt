however prehistoric preliterate cultures studied using archaeology historic literate cultures well subdiscipline historical archaeology many literate cultures ancient greece mesopotamia surviving records often incomplete biased extent many societies literacy restricted elite classes clergy bureaucracy court temple literacy even aristocrats sometimes restricted deeds contracts interests worldview elites often quite different lives interests populace writings produced people representative general population unlikely find libraries preserved posterity thus written records tend reflect biases assumptions cultural values possibly deceptions limited range individuals usually small fraction larger population hence written records cannot trusted sole source material record closer fair representation society though subject biases sampling bias differential preservation21

methodsedit
archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases employs variety methods practical work begin however clear objective archaeologists looking achieve must agreed upon done site surveyed find much possible surrounding area second excavation take place uncover archaeological features buried ground third data collected excavation studied evaluated attempt achieve original research objectives archaeologists considered good practice information published available archaeologists historians although sometimes neglected40
remote sensingedit
actually starting location remote sensing used look sites located within large area provide information sites regions types remote sensing instruments—passive active passive instruments detect natural energy reflected emitted observed scene passive instruments sense radiation emitted object viewed reflected object source instrument active instruments emit energy record reflected satellite imagery example passive remote sensing active remote sensing instruments
lidar light detection ranging lidar uses laser light amplification stimulated emission radiation transmit light pulse receiver sensitive detectors measure backscattered reflected light distance object determined recording time transmitted backscattered pulses using speed light calculate distance travelled lidars determine atmospheric profiles aerosols clouds constituents atmosphere

survey widely practiced early days archaeology cultural historians prior researchers usually content discovering locations monumental sites local populace excavating plainly visible features gordon willey pioneered technique regional settlement pattern survey 1949 viru valley coastal peru4243 survey levels became prominent rise processual archaeology years later44
survey work many benefits performed preliminary exercise even place excavation requires relatively little time expense require processing large volumes soil search artifacts nevertheless surveying large region site expensive archaeologists often employ sampling methods45 forms nondestructive archaeology survey avoids ethical issues particular concern descendant peoples associated destroying site excavation gather forms information settlement patterns settlement structure survey data commonly assembled maps show surface features andor artifact distribution

simplest survey technique surface survey involves combing area usually foot sometimes mechanized transport search features artifacts visible surface surface survey cannot detect sites features completely buried earth overgrown vegetation surface survey also include miniexcavation techniques augers corers shovel test pits materials found area surveyed deemed sterile
aerial survey conducted using cameras attached airplanes balloons uavs even kites46 birdseye view useful quick mapping large complex sites aerial photographs used document status archaeological aerial imaging also detect many things visible surface plants growing buried made structure stone wall develop slowly types features middens develop rapidly photographs ripening grain changes colour rapidly maturation revealed buried structures great precision aerial photographs taken different times help show outlines structures changes shadows aerial survey also employs ultraviolet infrared groundpenetrating radar wavelengths lidar thermography47
geophysical survey effective beneath ground magnetometers detect minute deviations earths magnetic field caused iron artifacts kilns types stone structures even ditches middens devices measure electrical resistivity soil also widely used archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts surrounding soils detected mapped archaeological features composed stone brick higher resistivity typical soils others organic deposits unfired clay tend lower resistivity
although archaeologists consider metal detectors tantamount treasure hunting others deem effective tool archaeological surveying48 examples formal archaeological metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis english civil battlefields metal distribution analysis prior excavation 19thcentury ship wreck service cable location evaluation metal detectorists also contributed archaeology made detailed records results refrained raising artifacts archaeological context metal detectorists solicited involvement portable antiquities scheme

archaeological excavation existed even field still domain amateurs remains source majority data recovered field projects reveal several types information usually accessible survey stratigraphy threedimensional structure verifiably primary context
modern excavation techniques require precise locations objects features known provenance provenience recorded always involves determining horizontal locations sometimes vertical position well also primary laws archaeology likewise association relationship nearby objects features needs recorded later analysis allows archaeologist deduce artifacts features likely used together different phases activity example excavation site reveals stratigraphy site occupied succession distinct cultures artifacts recent cultures ancient cultures
excavation expensive phase archaeological research relative terms also destructive process carries ethical concerns result sites excavated entirety percentage site excavated depends greatly country method statement issued sampling even important excavation surveysometimes large mechanical equipment backhoes jcbs used excavation especially remove topsoil overburden though method increasingly used great caution following rather dramatic step exposed area usually handcleaned trowels hoes ensure features apparent
