pathology greek roots pathos πάθος meaning experience suffering whence english word path derived transliteration logia λογία study significant component causal study pathogens major field modern medicine diagnosis hence study paths disease comes
term pathology used broadly refer study disease general incorporating wide range bioscience research fields medical practices including plant pathology veterinary pathology narrowly describe work within contemporary medical field general pathology includes number distinct interrelated medical specialties diagnose disease—mostly analysis tissue cell body fluid samples used count noun pathology plural pathologies also refer predicted actual progression particular diseases statement many different forms cancer diverse pathologies affix path sometimes used indicate state disease cases physical ailment cardiomyopathy psychological conditions psychopathy1 similarly pathological condition caused disease rather occurring physiologically physician practicing pathology called pathologist
field general inquiry research pathology addresses four components disease cause mechanisms development pathogenesis structural alterations cells morphologic changes consequences changes clinical manifestations2 common medical practice general pathology mostly concerned analyzing known clinical abnormalities markers precursors infectious noninfectious disease conducted experts major specialties anatomical pathology clinical pathology divisions specialty exist basis involved sample types comparing example cytopathology hematopathology histopathology organs renal pathology physiological systems oral pathology well basis focus examination forensic pathology
