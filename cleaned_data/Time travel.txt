time travel physicsedit
theories notably special general relativity suggest suitable geometries spacetime specific types motion space might allow time travel past future geometries motions possible20499 technical papers physicists discuss possibility closed timelike curves world lines form closed loops spacetime allowing objects return past known solutions equations general relativity describe spacetimes contain closed timelike curves gödel spacetime physical plausibility solutions uncertain
many scientific community believe backward time travel highly unlikely theory would allow time travel would introduce potential problems causality21 classic example problem involving causality grandfather paradox back time kill ones grandfather ones father conceived physicists novikov deutsch suggested sorts temporal paradoxes avoided novikov selfconsistency principle variation manyworlds interpretation interacting worlds22
general relativityedit
time travel past theoretically possible certain general relativity spacetime geometries permit traveling faster speed light cosmic strings transversable wormholes alcubierre drive232433–130 theory general relativity suggest scientific basis possibility backward time travel certain unusual scenarios although arguments semiclassical gravity suggest quantum effects incorporated general relativity loopholes closed25 semiclassical arguments hawking formulate chronology protection conjecture suggesting fundamental laws nature prevent time travel26 physicists cannot come definite judgment issue without theory quantum gravity join quantum mechanics general relativity completely unified theory2728150
special spacetime geometriesedit
general theory relativity extends special theory cover gravity illustrating terms curvature spacetime caused massenergy flow momentum general relativity describes universe system field equations exist solutions equations permit called closed timelike curves hence time travel past first proposed kurt gödel solution known gödel metric many others example requires universe physical characteristics appear have20499 whether general relativity forbids closed timelike curves realistic conditions unknown
wormholesedit
main article wormhole
wormholes hypothetical warped spacetime permitted einstein field equations general relativity29100 proposed timetravel machine using traversable wormhole would hypothetically work following wormhole accelerated significant fraction speed light perhaps advanced propulsion system brought back point origin alternatively another take entrance wormhole move within gravitational field object higher gravity entrance return position near entrance methods time dilation causes wormhole moved aged less become younger stationary seen external observer however time connects differently wormhole outside synchronized clocks either wormhole always remain synchronized seen observer passing wormhole matter ends move around20502 means observer entering younger would exit older time younger effectively going back time seen observer outside significant limitation time machine possible back time initial creation machine20503 essence path time device moves time would allow technology moved backward time
according current theories nature wormholes construction traversable wormhole would require existence substance negative energy often referred exotic matter technically wormhole spacetime requires distribution energy violates various energy conditions null energy condition along weak strong dominant energy conditions however known quantum effects lead small measurable violations null energy condition29101 many physicists believe required negative energy actually possible casimir effect quantum physics30 although early calculations suggested large amount negative energy would required later calculations showed amount negative energy made arbitrarily small31
1993 matt visser argued mouths wormhole induced clock difference could brought together without inducing quantum field gravitational effects would either make wormhole collapse mouths repel other32 mouths could brought close enough causality violation take place however 1997 paper visser hypothesized complex roman ring named roman configuration number wormholes arranged symmetric polygon could still time machine although concludes likely flaw classical quantum gravity theory rather proof causality violation possible33
approaches based general relativityedit
another approach involves dense spinning cylinder usually referred tipler cylinder solution discovered willem jacob stockum34 1936 kornel lanczos35 1924 recognized allowing closed timelike curves3621 analysis frank tipler37 1974 cylinder infinitely long spins fast enough long axis spaceship flying around cylinder spiral path could travel back time forward depending direction spiral however density speed required great ordinary matter strong enough construct similar device might built cosmic string none known exist seem possible create cosmic string physicist ronald mallett attempting recreate conditions rotating black hole ring lasers order bend spacetime allow time travel38
fundamental objection time travel schemes based rotating cylinders cosmic strings forward stephen hawking proved theorem showing according general relativity impossible build time machine special type time machine compactly generated cauchy horizon region weak energy condition satisfied meaning region contains matter negative energy density exotic matter solutions tiplers assume cylinders infinite length easier analyze mathematically although tipler suggested finite cylinder might produce closed timelike curves rotation rate fast enough36169 prove hawking points theorem cant done positive energy density everywhere prove build finite time machine need negative energy2896 result comes hawkings 1992 paper chronology protection conjecture examines case causality violations appear finite region spacetime without curvature singularities proves cauchy horizon compactly generated general contains closed null geodesics incomplete define geometrical quantities measure lorentz boost area increase going round closed null geodesics causality violation developed noncompact initial surface averaged weak energy condition must violated cauchy horizon26 theorem rule possibility time travel means time machines noncompactly generated cauchy horizons deutschpolitzer time machine regions contain exotic matter would used traversable wormholes alcubierre drive

quantummechanical phenomena quantum teleportation paradox quantum entanglement might appear create mechanism allows fasterthanlight communication time travel fact interpretations quantum mechanics bohm interpretation presume information exchanged particles instantaneously order maintain correlations particles41 effect referred spooky action distance einstein
nevertheless fact causality preserved quantum mechanics rigorous result modern quantum field theories therefore modern theories allow time travel communication specific instance claimed detailed analysis proven signal form classical communication must also used42 nocommunication theorem also gives general proof quantum entanglement cannot used transmit information faster classical signals
interacting manyworlds interpretationedit
variation everetts manyworlds interpretation quantum mechanics provides resolution grandfather paradox involves time traveler arriving different universe came argued since traveler arrives different universes history history genuine time travel43 accepted manyworlds interpretation suggests possible quantum events occur mutually exclusive histories44 however variations allow different universes interact concept often used sciencefiction physicists david deutsch suggested time traveler different history started from4546 hand stephen hawking argued even correct expect time traveler experience single selfconsistent history time travelers remain within world rather traveling different one47 physicist allen everett argued deutschs approach involves modifying fundamental principles quantum mechanics certainly goes beyond simply adopting everett also argues even deutschs approach correct would imply macroscopic object composed multiple particles would split apart traveling back time wormhole different particles emerging different worlds22
daniel greenberger karl svozil proposed quantum theory gives model time travel without paradoxes4849 quantum theory observation causes possible states collapse measured state hence past observed present deterministic possible state present observed past many possible states actions cause collapse state actions seen inevitable
experimental resultsedit
certain experiments carried give impression reversed causality fail show closer examination
delayed choice quantum eraser experiment performed marlan scully involves pairs entangled photons divided signal photons idler photons signal photons emerging locations position later measured doubleslit experiment depending idler photon measured experimenter either learn locations signal photon emerged erase information even though signal photons measured choice made idler photons choice seems retroactively determine whether interference pattern observed correlates measurements idler photons corresponding signal photons however since interference observed idler photons measured correlated signal photons experimenters tell choice made advance looking signal photons gathering classical information entire system thus causality preserved50
experiment lijun wang might also show causality violation since made possible send packages waves bulb caesium package appeared exit bulb nanoseconds entry wave package single welldefined object rather multiple waves different frequencies fourier analysis package appear move faster light even backward time even none pure waves effect cannot used send matter energy information faster light51 experiment understood violate causality either
physicists günter nimtz alfons stahlhofen university koblenz claim violated einsteins theory relativity transmitting photons faster speed light conducted experiment microwave photons traveled instantaneously pair prisms moved apart using phenomenon known quantum tunneling nimtz told scientist magazine time violation special relativity know however physicists phenomenon allow information transmitted faster light aephraim steinberg quantum optics expert university toronto canada uses analogy train traveling chicago york dropping train cars station along center train moves forward stop speed center train exceeds speed individual cars52
shengwang claims peerreviewed journal observed single photons precursors saying travel faster vacuum experiment involved slow light well passing light vacuum generated single photons passing rubidium atoms cooled laser thus slowing light passing vacuum times apparently precursors preceded photons main bodies precursor traveled vacuum according implies possibility light traveling faster thus possibility violating causality53
absence time travelers futureedit
time travel might possible region spacetime warped correct suggesting time travelers would able travel back earlier regions spacetime region created stephen hawking stated would explain world already overrun tourists future47 variation fermi paradox likewise absence tourists future prove time travel physically impossible might time travel physically possible never developed cautiously used carl sagan also suggested possibility time travelers could disguising existence recognized time travelers27

philosophers discussed nature time since least time ancient greece example parmenides presented view time illusion centuries later newton supported idea absolute time contemporary leibniz maintained time relation events cannot expressed independently latter approach eventually gave rise spacetime relativity66
presentism eternalismedit
many philosophers argued relativity implies eternalism idea past future exist real sense changes occurred occur present67 philosopher science dean rickles disagrees qualifications notes consensus among philosophers seems special general relativity incompatible presentism68 philosophers view time dimension equal spatial dimensions future events already sense different places exist objective flow time however view disputed69




ring paradox example relativity simultaneity ends pass ring simultaneously rest frame ring left ends pass rest frame right


presentism school philosophy holds future past exist changes occurred occur present real existence view time travel impossible future past travel to67 keller nelson argued even past future objects exist still definite truths past future events thus possible future truth time traveler deciding travel back present date could explain time travelers actual appearance present70 views contested authors71

grandfather paradoxedit
main article grandfather paradox
common objection idea traveling back time forth grandfather paradox argument autoinfanticide75 able back time inconsistencies contradictions would ensue time traveler change anything contradiction past becomes different is7677 paradox commonly described person travels past kills grandfather prevents existence father mother therefore existence27 philosophers question whether paradoxes make time travel impossible philosophers answer paradoxes arguing might case backward time travel could possible would impossible actually change past way78 idea similar proposed novikov selfconsistency principle physics
ontological paradoxedit
compossibilityedit
