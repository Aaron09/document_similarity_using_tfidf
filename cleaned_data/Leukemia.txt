explanation acute leukemia


general classificationedit
clinically pathologically leukemia subdivided variety large groups first division acute chronic forms

acute leukemia characterized rapid increase number immature blood cells crowding results cells makes bone marrow unable produce healthy blood cells immediate treatment required acute leukemia rapid progression accumulation malignant cells spill bloodstream spread organs body acute forms leukemia common forms leukemia children
chronic leukemia characterized excessive buildup relatively mature still abnormal white blood cells typically taking months years progress cells produced much higher rate normal resulting many abnormal white blood cells whereas acute leukemia must treated immediately chronic forms sometimes monitored time treatment ensure maximum effectiveness therapy chronic leukemia mostly occurs older people occur group

additionally diseases subdivided according kind blood cell affected divides leukemias lymphoblastic lymphocytic leukemias myeloid myelogenous leukemias

lymphoblastic lymphocytic leukemias cancerous change takes place type marrow cell normally goes form lymphocytes infectionfighting immune system cells lymphocytic leukemias involve specific subtype lymphocyte cell
myeloid myelogenous leukemias cancerous change takes place type marrow cell normally goes form blood cells types white cells platelets

combining classifications provides total four main categories within main categories typically several subcategories finally rarer types usually considered outside classification scheme
specific typesedit

acute lymphoblastic leukemia common type leukemia young children also affects adults especially older standard treatments involve chemotherapy radiotherapy survival rates vary children adults13 subtypes include precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia burkitts leukemia acute biphenotypic leukemia
chronic lymphocytic leukemia often affects adults sometimes occurs younger adults almost never affects children twothirds affected people fiveyear survival rate 7514 incurable many effective treatments subtype bcell prolymphocytic leukemia aggressive disease
acute myelogenous leukemia occurs commonly adults children commonly women treated chemotherapy fiveyear survival rate except acute promyelocytic leukemia survival rate greater 9015 subtypes include acute promyelocytic leukemia acute myeloblastic leukemia acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
chronic myelogenous leukemia occurs mainly adults small number children also develop disease treated imatinib gleevec united states glivec europe drugs16 fiveyear survival rate 901718 subtype chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
hairy cell leukemia sometimes considered subset chronic lymphocytic leukemia neatly category affected people adult cases children reported incurable easily treatable survival years19

signs symptomsedit




common symptoms chronic acute leukemia26


common symptoms children easy bruising pale skin fever enlarged spleen liver27
damage bone marrow displacing normal bone marrow cells higher numbers immature white blood cells results lack blood platelets important blood clotting process means people leukemia easily become bruised bleed excessively develop pinprick bleeds petechiae
white blood cells involved fighting pathogens suppressed dysfunctional could cause patients immune system unable fight simple infection start attacking body cells leukemia prevents immune system working normally patients experience frequent infection ranging infected tonsils sores mouth diarrhea lifethreatening pneumonia opportunistic infections
finally blood cell deficiency leads anemia cause dyspnea pallor
patients experience symptoms feeling sick fevers chills night sweats feeling fatigued flulike symptoms patients experience nausea feeling fullness enlarged liver spleen result unintentional weight loss blasts affected disease come together become swollen liver lymph nodes causing pain leading nausea28
leukemic cells invade central nervous system neurological symptoms notably headaches occur uncommon neurological symptoms like migraines seizures coma occur result brain stem pressure symptoms associated leukemia attributed diseases consequently leukemia always diagnosed medical tests
word leukemia means white blood derived characteristic high white blood cell count presents afflicted patients treatment high number white blood cells apparent blood sample viewed microscope extra white blood cells frequently immature dysfunctional excessive number cells also interfere level cells causing harmful imbalance blood count
leukemia patients high white blood cell counts visible regular blood count lesscommon condition called aleukemia bone marrow still contains cancerous white blood cells disrupt normal production blood cells remain marrow instead entering bloodstream would visible blood test aleukemic patient white blood cell counts bloodstream normal aleukemia occur four major types leukemia particularly common hairy cell leukemia29
causesedit
single known cause different types leukemias known causes generally factors within control average person account relatively cases30 cause cases leukemia unknown different leukemias likely different causes
leukemia like cancers results mutations certain mutations trigger leukemia activating oncogenes deactivating tumor suppressor genes thereby disrupting regulation cell death differentiation division mutations occur spontaneously result exposure radiation carcinogenic substances31
among adults known causes natural artificial ionizing radiation viruses human tlymphotropic virus chemicals notably benzene alkylating chemotherapy agents previous malignancies323334 tobacco associated small increase risk developing acute myeloid leukemia adults32 cohort casecontrol studies linked exposure petrochemicals hair dyes development forms leukemia diet limited effect although eating vegetables confer small protective benefit30
viruses also linked forms leukemia example human tlymphotropic virus htlv1 causes adult tcell leukemia35
cases maternalfetal transmission baby acquires leukemia mother leukemia pregnancy reported32 children born mothers fertility drugs induce ovulation twice likely develop leukemia childhoods children36
radiationedit
large doses sr90 emission nuclear reactors nicknamed bone seeker increases risk bone cancer leukemia animals presumed people37
genetic conditionsedit
people genetic predisposition towards developing leukemia predisposition demonstrated family histories twin studies32 affected people single gene multiple genes common cases families tend develop kinds leukemia members families affected people develop different forms leukemia related blood cancers32
addition genetic issues people chromosomal abnormalities certain genetic conditions greater risk leukemia33 example people syndrome significantly increased risk developing forms acute leukemia especially acute myeloid leukemia fanconi anemia risk factor developing acute myeloid leukemia32 mutation spred1 gene associated predisposition childhood leukemia38
chronic myelogenous leukemia associated genetic abnormality called philadelphia translocation people carry philadelphia mutation although exclusive observed people types leukemia39404142
nonionizing radiationedit
whether nonionizing radiation causes leukemia studied several decades international agency research cancer expert working group undertook detailed review data static extremely frequency electromagnetic energy occurs naturally association generation transmission electrical power43 concluded limited evidence high levels magnetic electric fields might cause cases childhood leukemia43 evidence relationship leukemia another form malignancy adults demonstrated43 since exposure levels elfs relatively uncommon world health organization concludes exposure later proven causative would account 2400 cases worldwide year representing total incidence childhood leukemia year leukemias44
diagnosisedit




increase white blood cells leukemia


diagnosis usually based repeated complete blood counts bone marrow examination following observations symptoms sometimes blood tests show person leukemia especially early stages disease remission lymph node biopsy performed diagnose certain types leukemia certain situations
following diagnosis blood chemistry tests used determine degree liver kidney damage effects chemotherapy patient concerns arise damage leukemia doctors xray ultrasound potentially show leukemias effects body parts bones xray brain kidneys spleen liver ultrasound scans used check lymph nodes chest though uncommon
despite methods diagnose whether patient leukemia many people diagnosed many symptoms vague nonspecific refer diseases reason american cancer society estimates least onefifth people leukemia diagnosed29

acute lymphoblasticedit
information acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment
management directed towards control bone marrow systemic wholebody disease additionally treatment must prevent leukemic cells spreading sites particularly central nervous system monthly lumbar punctures general treatment divided several phases

induction chemotherapy bring bone marrow remission adults standard induction plans include prednisone vincristine anthracycline drug drug plans include lasparaginase cyclophosphamide children lowrisk standard therapy usually consists three drugs prednisone lasparaginase vincristine first month treatment
consolidation therapy intensification therapy eliminate remaining leukemia cells many different approaches consolidation typically highdose multidrug treatment undertaken months patients averagerisk receive therapy antimetabolite drugs methotrexate 6mercaptopurine highrisk patients receive higher drug doses drugs plus additional drugs
prophylaxis preventive therapy stop cancer spreading brain nervous system highrisk patients standard prophylaxis include radiation head andor drugs delivered directly spine
