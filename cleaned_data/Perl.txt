overviewedit
main article perl language structure
according wall perl slogans first theres commonly known tmtowtdi second slogan easy things easy hard things possible14
featuresedit
overall structure perl derives broadly perl procedural nature variables expressions assignment statements bracedelimited blocks control structures subroutines
perl also takes features shell programming variables marked leading sigils allow variables interpolated directly strings however unlike shell perl uses sigils accesses variables unlike programming languages sigils sigil doesnt denote type variable type expression example access list values hash sigil array used sigil hash perl also many builtin functions provide tools often used shell programming although many tools implemented programs external shell sorting calling operating system facilities
perl takes lists lisp hashes associative arrays regular expressions simplify facilitate many parsing texthandling datamanagement tasks also shared lisp implicit return last value block fact statements value thus also expressions used larger expressions
perl added features support complex data structures firstclass functions closures values objectoriented programming model include references packages classbased method dispatch lexically scoped variables along compiler directives example strict pragma major additional feature introduced perl ability package code reusable modules wall later stated whole intent perl module system encourage growth perl culture rather perl core66
versions perl automatic datatyping automatic memory management interpreter knows type storage requirements every data object program allocates frees storage necessary using reference counting cannot deallocate circular data structures without manual intervention legal type conversions example conversions number string done automatically time illegal type conversions fatal errors
designedit
design perl understood response three broad trends computer industry falling hardware costs rising labor costs improvements compiler technology many earlier computer languages fortran aimed make efficient expensive computer hardware contrast perl designed computer programmers could write programs quickly easily
perl many features ease task programmer expense greater memory requirements include automatic memory management dynamic typing strings lists hashes regular expressions introspection eval function perl follows theory builtin limits60 idea similar zero infinity rule
wall trained linguist design perl much informed linguistic principles examples include huffman coding common constructions short good endweighting important information come first large collection language primitives perl favors language constructs concise natural humans write even complicate perl interpreter
perls syntax reflects idea things different look different67 example scalars arrays hashes different leading sigils array indices hash keys different kinds braces strings regular expressions different standard delimiters approach contrasted language lisp basic syntax composed simple universal symbolic expressions used purposes
perl enforce particular programming paradigm procedural objectoriented functional others even require programmer choose among
broad practical bent perl language community culture surround preface programming perl begins perl language getting done14 consequence perl tidy language includes many features tolerates exceptions rules employs heuristics resolve syntactical ambiguities forgiving nature compiler bugs sometimes hard find perls function documentation remarks variant behavior builtin functions list scalar contexts saying general want unless want consistency68
written specification standard perl language exists perl versions perl plans create current version perl implementation interpreter language evolved along interpreter together functional tests stands facto specification language perl however started specification69 several projects70 implement specification
applicationsedit
perl many varied applications compounded availability many standard thirdparty modules
perl chiefly used write scripts large projects written perl include cpanel slash bugzilla twiki movable type hightraffic websites perl extensively include pricelinecom craigslist71 imdb72 livejournal duckduckgo7374 slashdot ticketmaster also optional component popular lamp technology stack development lieu python
perl often used glue language tying together systems interfaces specifically designed interoperate data munging75 converting processing large amounts data tasks creating reports fact strengths intimately linked combination makes perl popular allpurpose language system administrators particularly short programs often called oneliner programs entered single command line
perl code made portable across windows unix code often used suppliers software cots bespoke simplify packaging maintenance software build deploymentscripts
graphical user interfaces guis developed using perl example perltk wxperl commonly used enable user interaction perl scripts interaction synchronous asynchronous using callbacks update
implementationedit
perl implemented core interpreter written together large collection modules written perl 2010update interpreter 150000 lines code compiles executable typical machine architectures alternatively interpreter compiled link library embedded programs nearly modules distribution comprising 200000 lines perl additional 350000 lines code much code modules consists character encoding tables
interpreter objectoriented architecture elements perl language—scalars arrays hashes coderefs file handles—are represented interpreter structs operations structs defined large collection macros typedefs functions constitute perl perl bewildering uninitiated entry points follow consistent naming scheme provides guidance
life perl interpreter divides broadly compile phase phase76 perl phases major stages interpreters lifecycle interpreter goes phase phases follow fixed sequence
happens perls compile phase compilation happens perls phase execution significant exceptions perl makes important capability execute perl code compile phase perl also delay compilation phase terms indicate kind processing actually occurring moment compile time time perl compile time points compile phase compile time also entered phase compile time code string argument passed eval builtin occurs phase perl often time compile phase spends phase time code begin blocks executes time compile phase
compile time interpreter parses perl code syntax tree time executes program walking tree text parsed syntax tree subject optimization executed execution relatively efficient compiletime optimizations syntax tree include constant folding context propagation peephole optimization also performed
perl turingcomplete grammar parsing affected runtime code executed compile phase77 therefore perl cannot parsed straight lexyacc lexerparser combination instead interpreter implements lexer coordinates modified bison parser resolve ambiguities language
often said perl parse perl78 meaning perl interpreter perl parse perl language perl even general true perl interpreter simulate turing machine compile phase would need decide halting problem order complete parsing every case longstanding result halting problem undecidable therefore even perl always parse perl perl makes unusual choice giving user access full programming power compile phase cost terms theoretical purity high practical inconvenience seems rare
programs undertake parse perl sourcecode analyzers autoindenters contend ambiguous syntactic constructs also undecidability perl parsing general case adam kennedys project focused parsing perl code document retaining integrity document instead parsing perl executable code even perl always kennedy first conjectured parsing perl suffers halting problem79 later proved80
perl distributed 250000 functional tests core perl language 250000 functional tests core modules part normal build process extensively exercise interpreter core modules perl developers rely functional tests ensure changes interpreter introduce software bugs additionally perl users interpreter passes functional tests system high degree confidence working properly
availabilityedit
perl dual licensed artistic license 1056 general public license7 distributions available operating systems particularly prevalent unix unixlike systems ported modern many obsolete platforms sixcitation needed reported exceptions perl compiled source code posixcompliant otherwiseunixcompatible platforms81
unusual changes required classic environment special port called macperl shipped independently82
comprehensive perl archive network carries complete list supported platforms links distributions available each83 cpan also source publicly available perl modules part core perl distribution
windowsedit

database interfacesedit
perls texthandling capabilities used generating queries arrays hashes automatic memory management make easy collect process returned data example bunces perl application programming interface arguments text queries thus possible program multiple languages time generating page using html javascript document perl variable interpolation programmatically customize queries specification perl arrays hashes structures programmatically hold resulting data sets query allows highlevel mechanism handling large amounts data postprocessing perl subprogram87 early versions perl database interfaces created relinking interpreter clientside database library sufficiently difficult done mostimportant widely used databases restricted resulting perl executable using database interface time
perl database interfaces implemented perl modules database interface module presents single databaseindependent interface perl applications database driver modules handle details accessing different databases drivers ansi databases
provides caching database handles queries greatly improve performance longlived execution environments perl88 helping highvolume systems avert load spikes slashdot effect
modern perl applications especially written using frameworks catalyst module often used indirectly objectrelational mappers dbixclass classdbi rosedbobject generate queries handle data transparently application author
comparative performanceedit
computer language benchmarks game compares performance implementations typical programming problems several programming languages89 submitted perl implementations typically perform toward high memoryusage spectrum give varied speed results perls performance benchmarks game typical interpreted languages90
large perl programs start slowly similar programs compiled languages perl compile source every time runs talk yapceurope 2005 conference subsequent article timely start jeanlouis leroy found perl programs took much longer expected perl interpreter spent significant time finding modules within overlarge include path91 unlike java python ruby perl experimental support precompiling92 therefore perl programs overhead penalty every execution phase typical programs long enough amortized startup time substantial benchmarks measure short execution times likely skewed overhead
number tools introduced improve situation first tool apaches perl sought address mostcommon reasons small perl programs invoked rapidly development activeperl microsoft isapi provides similar performance improvements
perl code compiled additional overhead execution phase typically isnt present programs written compiled languages examples overhead include bytecode interpretation referencecounting memory management dynamic typechecking
