main article atmospheric pressure
atmospheric pressure particular location force unit area perpendicular surface determined weight vertical column atmosphere location earth units pressure based internationally recognized standard atmosphere defined 101325 torr 14696 measured barometer
atmospheric pressure decreases increasing altitude diminishing mass height pressure atmosphere declines factor irrational number value 271828 called scale height denoted atmosphere uniform temperature scale height proportional temperature inversely proportional product mean molecular mass local acceleration gravity location model atmosphere pressure declines exponentially increasing altitude however atmospheres uniform temperature estimation atmospheric pressure particular altitude complex
atmospheric escapeedit
main article atmospheric escape
surface gravity differs significantly among planets example large gravitational force giant planet jupiter retains light gases hydrogen helium escape objects lower gravity secondly distance determines energy available heat atmospheric point fraction molecules thermal motion exceed planets escape velocity allowing escape planets gravitational grasp thus distant cold titan triton pluto able retain atmospheres despite relatively gravities
since collection molecules moving wide range velocities always fast enough produce slow leakage space lighter molecules move faster heavier ones thermal kinetic energy gases molecular weight lost rapidly high molecular weight thought venus mars lost much water photo dissociated hydrogen oxygen solar ultraviolet hydrogen escaped earths magnetic field helps prevent normally solar wind would greatly enhance escape hydrogen however past billion years earth lost gases magnetic polar regions auroral activity including atmospheric oxygen3
