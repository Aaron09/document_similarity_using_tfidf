investment project valuationedit
information business valuation stock valuation fundamental analysis
general30 projects value estimated using discounted cash flow valuation opportunity highest value measured resultant present value selected applied corporate finance joel dean 1951 requires estimating size timing incremental cash flows resulting project future cash flows discounted determine present value time value money present values summed initial investment outlay financial modeling
greatly affected discount rate thus identifying proper discount rate often termed project hurdle rate31 critical choosing good projects investments firm hurdle rate minimum acceptable return investment project appropriate discount rate hurdle rate reflect riskiness investment typically measured volatility cash flows must take account projectrelevant financing mix32 managers models capm estimate discount rate appropriate particular project weighted average cost capital wacc reflect financing selected common error choosing discount rate project apply wacc applies entire firm approach appropriate risk particular project differs markedly firms existing portfolio assets
conjunction several measures used secondary selection criteria corporate finance visible include discounted payback period modified equivalent annuity capital efficiency alternatives complements include residual income valuation joel stern stern stewart stewart myers list valuation topics
valuing flexibilityedit
main articles real options analysis decision tree
many cases example projects project open close various paths action company reality typically captured strict approach33 analysts account uncertainty adjusting discount rate increasing cost capital cash flows using certainty equivalents applying subjective haircuts forecast numbers3435 even employed however latter methods normally properly account changes risk projects lifecycle hence fail appropriately adapt risk adjustment36 management therefore sometimes employ tools place explicit value options whereas valuation likely average scenario specific cash flows discounted flexible staged nature investment modelled hence potential payoffs considered real options valuation difference valuations value flexibility inherent project
common tools decision tree analysis dta37 real options valuation rov38 often used interchangeably

values flexibility incorporating possible events states consequent management decisions example company would build factory given demand product exceeded certain level pilotphase outsource production otherwise turn given demand would similarly expand factory maintain otherwise model contrast branching scenario must modelled separately decision tree management decision response event generates branch path company could follow probabilities event determined specified management tree constructed possible events resultant paths visible management given knowledge events could follow assuming rational decision making management chooses branches actions corresponding highest value path probability weighted path taken representative project value decision theorychoice uncertainty
usually used value project contingent value asset underlying variable example viability mining project contingent price gold price management abandon mining rights sufficiently high management develop body valuation would capture outcomes using financial option theory framework decision taken identified corresponding either call option option appropriate valuation technique employed usually variant binomial options model bespoke simulation model black scholes type formulae used less often contingent claim valuation true value project likely scenario plus option value real options corporate finance first discussed stewart myers 1977 viewing corporate strategy series options originally timothy luehrman late 1990s also option pricing approaches business valuation

quantifying uncertaintyedit
information sensitivity analysis scenario planning monte carlo methods finance
given uncertainty inherent project forecasting valuation3739 analysts wish assess sensitivity project various inputs assumptions model typical sensitivity analysis analyst vary factor holding inputs constant ceteris paribus sensitivity change factor observed calculated slope δnpv δfactor example analyst determine various growth rates annual revenue specified usually increments determine sensitivity using formula often several variables interest various combinations produce valuesurfacedisambiguation needed40 even valuespace function several variables also stress testing
using related technique analysts also scenario based forecasts scenario comprises particular outcome economywide global factors demand product exchange rates commodity prices well companyspecific factors unit costs example analyst specify various revenue growth scenarios worst case likely case best case inputs adjusted consistent growth assumptions calculate note scenario based analysis various combinations inputs must internally consistent discussion financial modeling whereas sensitivity approach need application methodology determine unbiased management determines subjective probability scenario project probabilityweighted average various scenarios first chicago method also rnpv cash flows opposed scenarios probabilityweighted
advancement overcomes limitations sensitivity scenario analyses examining effects possible combinations variables realizations construct stochastic42 probabilistic financial models opposed traditional static deterministic models above39 purpose common method monte carlo simulation analyze projects method introduced finance david hertz 1964 although recently become common today analysts even able simulations spreadsheet based models typically using riskanalysis addin risk crystal ball cash flow components heavily impacted uncertainty simulated mathematically reflecting random characteristics contrast scenario approach simulation produces several thousand random possible outcomes trials covering conceivable real world contingencies proportion likelihood monte carlo simulation versus scenarios output histogram project average potential investment well volatility sensitivities observed histogram provides information visible static example allows estimate probability project present value greater zero value
continuing example instead assigning three discrete values revenue growth relevant variables analyst would assign appropriate probability distribution variable commonly triangular beta possible specify observed supposed correlation variables distributions would sampled repeatedly incorporating correlation generate several thousand random possible scenarios corresponding valuations used generate histogram resultant statistics average standard deviation accurate mirror projects randomness variance observed scenario based approach often used estimates underlying spot price volatility real option valuation real options valuation valuation inputs robust monte carlo model would include possible occurrence risk events credit crunch drive variations model inputs

management must also choose form dividend distribution generally cash dividends share buyback various factors taken consideration shareholders must dividends firms elect retain earnings perform stock buyback cases increasing value shares outstanding alternatively companies dividends stock rather cash corporate action financial theory suggests dividend policy based upon type company management determines best dividend resources firm shareholders general rule shareholders growth companies would prefer managers retain earnings dividends excess cash reinvest companys operations whereas shareholders value secondary stocks would prefer management companies payout surplus earnings form cash dividends positive return cannot earned reinvestment undistributed earnings share buyback program accepted value stock greater returns realized reinvestment undistributed profits instances appropriate dividend policy usually directed maximizes longterm shareholder value
