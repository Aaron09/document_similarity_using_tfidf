issue relates cost traditionally single payment made time burial cemetery authority incurs expenses cemetery maintenance many decades many cemetery authorities find accumulated funds sufficient costs longterm maintenance shortfall funds maintenance results three main options charge much higher prices burials obtain kind public subsidy neglect maintenance cemeteries without space burials options even limited public attitudes towards subsidies highly variable people family buried local cemeteries usually quite concerned neglect cemetery maintenance usually argue favour public subsidy local cemetery maintenance whereas people without connection area often argue public spending comes taxes therefore spent living district rather wasted dead
another issue relates limited amount land many larger towns cities older cemeteries initially considered large often space burials vacant adjacent land available extend cemetery even land general area create cemeteries cemeteries generally established periphery towns cities large tracts land still available however people often wish buried cemetery relatives creating pressure find space existing cemeteries interested buried cemeteries sense connection family
third issue maintenance monuments headstones generally responsibility families often become neglected time decay damage vandalism cemetery maintenance practices render monuments headstones either unsafe least unsightly hand families forget grave constantly visit leaving behind flowers plants decorative items create maintenance problem
reuse gravesedit

hand cemetery authorities well aware many graves forgotten visited reuse cause distress anyone however older graves cemetery local vocal descendants mount public campaign reuse pragmatic strategy publicly announce plans reuse older graves invite families respond willing reuse occurs objections allowing forgotten graves reused sometimes cemetery authorities request payment avoid reuse grave often backfires politically
practical problem regard contacting families original person organised burial also dead buried locating living family members many decades later virtually impossible least prohibitively expensive therefore communication reuse local cemeteries tends occur local publications often reach family members living afield become aware reuse grave event removal destruction monuments headstones
cemeteries foresee need reuse included original terms conditions limited tenure grave site cemeteries follow practice seen problems faced older cemeteries however even cemetery legal right reuse grave strong public opinion often forces authorities back reuse also even cemeteries limited tenure provision place often funding shortages force contemplate reuse earlier original arrangements provided
another type grave site must considered reuse never used purchased time future principle would seem easier reuse grave sites claims desecration often made complicated legal rights buried obtained prepurchase limited tenure clause takes effect burial cemetery authorities suspect many cases holders burial rights probably dead nobody exercise burial right families aware burial rights possess intend exercise family members difficulty unable locate holders burial rights complicates reuse graves
