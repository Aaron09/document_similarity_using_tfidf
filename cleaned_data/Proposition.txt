treatment logicedit
noted aristotelian logic proposition particular kind sentence affirms denies predicate subject help copula aristotelian propositions take forms like mortal socrates
propositions show modern formal logic objects formal language formal language begins different types symbols types include variables operators function symbols predicate relation symbols quantifiers propositional constants grouping symbols often added convenience using language play logical role symbols concatenated together according recursive rules order construct strings truthvalues assigned rules specify operators function predicate symbols quantifiers concatenated strings proposition string specific form form proposition takes depends type logic
type logic called propositional sentential statement logic includes operators propositional constants symbols language propositions language propositional constants considered atomic propositions composite propositions composed recursively applying operators propositions application simply short saying corresponding concatenation rule applied
types logics called predicate quantificational norder logic include variables operators predicate function symbols quantifiers symbols languages propositions logics complex first terms must defined term variable function symbol applied number terms required function symbols arity example binary function symbol variables term might written symbols various orders proposition predicate symbol applied number terms required arity operator applied number propositions required arity quantifier applied proposition example binary predicate symbol quantifier ∀xyz proposition complex structure propositions allows logics make finer distinctions inferences greater expressive power
context propositions also called sentences statements statement forms formulas wellformed formulas though terms usually synonymous within single text definition treats propositions syntactic objects opposed semantic mental objects propositions sense meaningless formal abstract objects assigned meaning truthvalues mappings called interpretations valuations respectively
