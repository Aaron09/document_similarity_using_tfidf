stainless steel familiesedit

main article steel grades
within stainless steels four families

austenitic stainless steel include called superaustenitics




nickel added austenite structure iron stabilized crystal structure makes steels virtually nonmagnetic less brittle temperatures






significant quantities manganese used many stainless steel compositions manganese preserves austenitic structure steel similar nickel lower cost




ferritic stainless steel


martensitic stainless steel




greater hardness strength carbon added proper heat treatment steels used products razor blades cutlery tools




duplex stainless steel also called austenitic ferritic stainless steels




pipes fittings made stainless steel




stainless steels also classified crystalline structure

austenitic series stainless steels austenitic crystalline structure facecentered cubic crystal structure austenite steels make total stainless steel production contain maximum carbon minimum chromium sufficient nickel andor manganese retain austenitic structure temperatures cryogenic region melting point alloy




series—austenitic chromiumnickelmanganese alloys type hardenable cold working type general purpose stainless steel decreasing nickel content increasing manganese results weak corrosion resistance20






series widely used austenite steel also known composition chromium nickel21 referred stainless confused aisi grade hardening alloy tool steel containing chromium second common austenite steel grade also referred stainless called marine grade stainless used primarily increased resistance corrosion typical composition chromium nickel commonly known 1810 stainless often used cutlery highquality cookware also available


superaustenitic stainless steels allegheny ludlum alloy al6xn 254smo exhibit great resistance chloride pitting crevice corrosion high molybdenum content nitrogen additions higher nickel content ensures better resistance stresscorrosion cracking versus series higher alloy content superaustenitic steels makes expensive steels offer similar performance lower cost preferred certain applications example astm a387 used pressure vessels lowalloy carbon steel chromium content lowcarbon versions example 316l 304l used avoid corrosion problems caused welding grade 316lvm preferred biocompatibility required body implants piercings23 means carbon content alloy reduces sensitization effect precipitation chromium carbides grain boundaries caused high temperatures involved welding


ferritic stainless steels generally better engineering properties austenitic grades reduced corrosion resistance lower chromium nickel content also usually less expensive ferritic stainless steels bodycentered cubic crystal system contain chromium little nickel types contain lead compositions include molybdenum aluminium titanium common ferritic grades include 18cr2mo 26cr1mo 29cr4mo 29cr4mo2ni alloys degraded presence sigma chromium intermetallic phase precipitate upon welding





swiss army knives made martensitic stainless steel



martensitic stainless steels corrosionresistant classes extremely strong tough well highly machinable hardened heat treatment martensitic stainless steel contains chromium 12–14 molybdenum 02–1 nickel less carbon 01–1 giving hardness making material brittle quenched magnetic
