french painters prepared impressionism include romantic colourist eugène delacroix leader realists gustave courbet painters barbizon school théodore rousseau impressionists learned much work johan barthold jongkind jeanbaptistecamille corot eugène boudin painted nature direct spontaneous style prefigured impressionism befriended advised younger artists
number identifiable techniques working habits contributed innovative style impressionists although methods used previous artists—and often conspicuous work artists frans hals diego velázquez peter paul rubens john constable turner—the impressionists first together consistency techniques include

short thick strokes paint quickly capture essence subject rather details paint often applied impasto
colours applied sidebyside little mixing possible technique exploits principle simultaneous contrast make colour appear vivid viewer
grays dark tones produced mixing complementary colours pure impressionism avoids black paint
paint placed paint without waiting successive applications producing softer edges intermingling colour
impressionist paintings exploit transparency thin paint films glazes earlier artists manipulated carefully produce effects impressionist painting surface typically opaque
paint applied white lightcoloured ground previously painters often used dark grey strongly coloured grounds
play natural light emphasized close attention paid reflection colours object object painters often worked evening produce effets soir—the shadowy effects evening twilight
paintings made plein outdoors shadows boldly painted blue reflected onto surfaces giving sense freshness previously represented painting blue shadows snow inspired technique

technology played role development style impressionists took advantage midcentury introduction premixed paints tubes resembling modern toothpaste tubes allowed artists work spontaneously outdoors indoors20 previously painters made paints individually grinding mixing pigment powders linseed stored animal bladders21
many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available artists first time 19th century included cobalt blue viridian cadmium yellow synthetic ultramarine blue 1840s impressionism22 impressionists manner painting made bold pigments even newer colours cerulean blue3 became commercially available artists 1860s22
impressionists progress toward brighter style painting gradual 1860s monet renoir sometimes painted canvases prepared traditional redbrown grey ground23 1870s monet renoir pissarro usually chose paint grounds lighter grey beige colour functioned middle tone finished painting23 1880s impressionists come prefer white slightly offwhite grounds longer allowed ground colour significant role finished painting24
