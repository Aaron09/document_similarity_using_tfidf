organic chemistry term aromaticity used describe cyclic ringshaped planar flat molecule ring resonance bonds exhibits stability geometric connective arrangements atoms aromatic molecules stable break apart easily react substances organic compounds aromatic classified aliphatic compounds—they might cyclic aromatic rings special stability reactivity
since common aromatic compounds derivatives benzene aromatic hydrocarbon common petroleum distillates word “aromatic” occasionally refers informally benzene derivatives first defined nevertheless many nonbenzene aromatic compounds exist living organisms example common aromatic rings doubleringed bases aromatic functional group substituent called aryl group
earliest term aromatic article august wilhelm hofmann 18551 hofmann used term class benzene compounds many odors aromas unlike pure saturated hydrocarbons aromaticity chemical property bears general relationship olfactory properties compounds smell although 1855 structure benzene organic compounds understood chemists like hofmann beginning understand odiferous molecules plants terpenes chemical properties recognize today similar unsaturated petroleum hydrocarbons like benzene

theoryedit

standard resonance diagrams doubleheaded arrow indicates structures distinct entities merely hypothetical possibilities neither accurate representation actual compound best represented hybrid average structures seen right bond shorter bond benzene perfectly hexagonal—all carbon–carbon bonds length intermediate single double bond
cyclic molecule three alternating double bonds cyclohexatriene bond length single bond would double bond would however molecule benzene length bonds lengths23
better representation circular πbond armstrongs inner cycle electron density evenly distributed πbond ring model correctly represents location electron density within aromatic ring
single bonds formed overlap hybridized atomic sp2orbitals line carbon nuclei—these called σbonds double bonds consist σbond πbond πbonds formed overlap atomic porbitals plane ring following diagram shows positions porbitals



since plane atoms orbitals interact freely become delocalized means instead tied atom carbon electron shared ring thus enough electrons form double bonds carbon atoms extra electrons strengthen bonds ring equally resulting molecular orbital considered symmetry

term aromaticedit
first known word aromatic chemical term—namely apply compounds contain phenyl group—occurs article august wilhelm hofmann 185514 indeed earliest introduction term curious hofmann says nothing introduced adjective indicating olfactory character apply group chemical substances notable aromas also many odoriferous organic substances known terpenes aromatic chemical sense terpenes benzenoid substances chemical characteristic common namely higher unsaturation many aliphatic compounds hofmann making distinction categories many earliestknown examples aromatic compounds benzene toluene distinctive pleasant smells property term aromatic class compounds hence term aromaticity eventually discovered electronic property5

historic benzene formulae proposed august kekulé 18656


19th century chemists found puzzling benzene could unreactive toward addition reactions given presumed high degree unsaturation cyclohexatriene structure benzene first proposed august kekulé 186578 chemists quick accept structure since accounted known isomeric relationships aromatic chemistry hexagonal structure explains isomer benzene exists disubstituted compounds three isomers4
1897 1906 thomson discoverer electron proposed three equivalent electrons pair carbon atoms benzene explanation exceptional stability benzene conventionally attributed robert robinson apparently first 19259 coin term aromatic sextet group electrons resists disruption
fact concept traced back ernest crocker 192210 henry edward armstrong 1890 wrote centric affinities within cyclebenzene represented double ring additive compound formed inner cycle affinity suffers disruption contiguous carbonatoms nothing attached necessity acquire ethylenic condition11verification needed
armstrong describing least four modern conceptsverification needed first affinity better known nowadays electron discovered seven years later thomson second describing electrophilic aromatic substitution proceeding third wheland intermediate fourth conjugation ring broken introduced symbol centered ring shorthand inner cycle thus anticipating erich clars notation argued also anticipated nature wave mechanics since recognized affinities direction merely point particles collectively distribution could altered introducing substituents onto benzene ring much distribution electric charge body altered bringing near another body

characteristics aromatic aryl compoundsedit

delocalized conjugated system commonly arrangement alternating single double bonds

number delocalized electrons even multiple πelectrons known hückels rule

according hückels rule molecule πelectrons aromatic πelectrons characteristics molecule said antiaromatic whereas benzene aromatic electrons double bonds cyclobutadiene antiaromatic since number delocalized electrons course multiple cyclobutadienide2− however aromatic electrons atom aromatic system electrons part system therefore ignored rule furan oxygen atom hybridized lone pair system plane ring analogous bond positions πelectrons furan aromatic
aromatic molecules typically display enhanced chemical stability compared similar nonaromatic molecules molecule aromatic tend change toward aromaticity added stability changes chemistry molecule aromatic compounds undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions electrophilic addition reactions happens carbon–carbon double bonds
presence magnetic field circulating πelectrons aromatic molecule produce aromatic ring current induces additional magnetic field important effect nuclear magnetic resonance14 signal protons plane aromatic ring shifted substantially downfield nonaromatic carbons important detecting aromaticity mechanism signals protons located near ring axis shifted upfield
aromatic molecules able interact socalled stacking systems form parallel rings overlap facetoface orientation aromatic molecules also able interact edgetoface orientation slight positive charge substituents ring atoms molecule attracted slight negative charge aromatic system another molecule
planar monocyclic molecules containing πelectrons called antiaromatic general unstable molecules could antiaromatic tend change electronic conformation thereby becoming nonaromatic example cyclooctatetraene distorts planarity breaking overlap adjacent double bonds recent studies determined cyclobutadiene adopts asymmetric rectangular configuration single double bonds indeed alternate resonance single bonds markedly longer double bonds reducing unfavorable porbital overlap reduction symmetry lifts degeneracy formerly nonbonding molecular orbitals hunds rule forces unpaired electrons weakly bonding orbital also creates weakly antibonding orbital hence cyclobutadiene nonaromatic strain asymmetric configuration outweighs antiaromatic destabilization would afflict symmetric square configuration
