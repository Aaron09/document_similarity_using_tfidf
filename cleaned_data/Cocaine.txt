side effects chronic cocaine


chronic cocaine intake causes strong imbalances transmitter levels order compensate extremes thus receptors disappear cell surface reappear resulting less working mode respectively change susceptibility binding partners ligands mechanisms called downregulation upregulation however studies suggest cocaine abusers show normal agerelated loss striatal dopamine transporter sites suggesting cocaine neuroprotective properties dopamine neurons43 possible side effects include insatiable hunger aches insomniaoversleeping lethargy persistent runny nose depression suicidal ideation develop heavy users finally loss vesicular monoamine transporters neurofilament proteins morphological changes appear indicate long term damage dopamine neurons effects contribute rise tolerance thus requiring larger dosage achieve effect44 lack normal amounts serotonin dopamine brain cause dysphoria depression felt initial high physical withdrawal dangerous physiological changes caused cocaine withdrawal include vivid unpleasant dreams insomnia hypersomnia increased appetite psychomotor retardation agitation44
physical side effects chronic smoking cocaine include coughing blood bronchospasm itching fever diffuse alveolar infiltrates without effusions pulmonary systemic eosinophilia chest pain lung trauma sore throat asthma hoarse voice dyspnea shortness breath aching flulike syndrome cocaine constricts blood vessels dilates pupils increases body temperature heart rate blood pressure also cause headaches gastrointestinal complications abdominal pain nausea common untrue belief smoking cocaine chemically breaks tooth enamel causes tooth decay however cocaine often cause involuntary tooth grinding known bruxism deteriorate tooth enamel lead gingivitis45 additionally stimulants like cocaine methamphetamine even caffeine cause dehydration mouth since saliva important mechanism maintaining ones oral level chronic stimulant abusers hydrate sufficiently experience demineralization teeth tooth surface dropping cocaine also promotes formation blood clots25 increase blood clot formation attributed cocaineassociated increases activity plasminogen activator inhibitor increase number activation aggregation platelets25
