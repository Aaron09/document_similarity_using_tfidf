introductionedit
propositional logic deals simple declarative propositions firstorder logic additionally covers predicates quantification
predicate takes entity entities domain discourse input outputs either true false consider sentences socrates philosopher plato philosopher propositional logic sentences viewed unrelated might denoted example variables predicate philosopher occurs sentences common structure philosopher variable instantiated socrates first sentence instantiated plato second sentence firstorder logic allows predicates philosopher example propositional logic not5
relationships predicates stated using logical connectives consider example firstorder formula philosopher scholar formula conditional statement philosopher hypothesis scholar conclusion truth formula depends object denoted interpretations predicates philosopher scholar
quantifiers applied variables formula variable previous formula universally quantified instance firstorder sentence every philosopher scholar universal quantifier every sentence expresses idea claim philosopher scholar holds choices
negation sentence every philosopher scholar logically equivalent sentence exists philosopher scholar existential quantifier exists expresses idea claim philosopher scholar holds choice
predicates philosopher scholar take single variable general predicates take several variables firstorder sentence socrates teacher plato predicate teacher takes variables
interpretation model firstorder formula specifies predicate means entities instantiate variables entities form domain discourse universe usually required nonempty example interpretation domain discourse consisting human beings predicate philosopher understood author republic sentence exists philosopher seen true witnessed plato

common divide symbols alphabet logical symbols always meaning nonlogical symbols whose meaning varies interpretation example logical symbol

logical symbolsedit
several logical symbols alphabet vary author usually include

quantifier symbols
logical connectives conjunction disjunction implication biconditional negation occasionally logical connective symbols included authors instead instead especially contexts used purposes moreover horseshoe replace triplebar replace tilde replace replace middle replace especially symbols available technical reasons note aforementioned symbols used polish notation
parentheses brackets punctuation symbols choice symbols varies depending context
infinite variables often denoted lowercase letters alphabet subscripts often used distinguish variables
equality symbol sometimes identity symbol section equality

noted symbols required quantifiers negation conjunction variables brackets equality suffice numerous minor variations define additional logical symbols

sometimes truth constants true false included without logical operators valence constants expressed using quantifiers
sometimes additional logical connectives included sheffer stroke nand exclusive

nonlogical symbolsedit
nonlogical symbols represent predicates relations functions constants domain discourse used standard practice fixed infinite nonlogical symbols purposes recent practice different nonlogical symbols according application mind therefore become necessary name nonlogical symbols used particular application choice made signature6
traditional approach infinite nonlogical symbols signature applications consequently traditional approach language firstorder logic7 approach still common especially philosophically oriented books

every integer collection nary nplace predicate symbols represent relations elements also called relation symbols arity infinite supply




every integer infinitely many nary function symbols





contemporary mathematical logic signature varies application typical signatures mathematics groups ordered fields restrictions number nonlogical symbols signature empty finite infinite even uncountable uncountable signatures occur example modern proofs löwenheim–skolem theorem
approach every nonlogical symbol following types

predicate symbol relation symbol valence arity number arguments greater equal often denoted uppercase letters

relations valence identified propositional variables example stand statement
example predicate variable valence possible interpretation
predicate variable valence possible interpretations include greater father


function symbol valence greater equal often denoted lowercase letters

examples interpreted father arithmetic stand theory stand power arithmetic stand theory stand union
function symbols valence called constant symbols often denoted lowercase letters beginning alphabet symbol stand socrates arithmetic stand theory constant stand empty



traditional approach recovered modern approach simply specifying custom signature consist traditional sequences nonlogical symbols

algebraizationsedit
alternate approach semantics firstorder logic proceeds abstract algebra approach generalizes lindenbaum–tarski algebras propositional logic three ways eliminating quantified variables firstorder logic involve replacing quantifiers variable binding term operators

cylindric algebra alfred tarski coworkers
polyadic algebra paul halmos

firstorder theories models elementary classesedit
firstorder theory particular signature axioms sentences consisting symbols signature axioms often finite recursively enumerable case theory called effective authors require theories also include logical consequences axioms axioms considered hold within theory sentences hold within theory derived
firstorder structure satisfies sentences given theory said model theory elementary class structures satisfying particular theory classes main subject study model theory

several difficulties empty domains however

many common rules inference valid domain discourse required nonempty example rule stating

definition truth interpretation uses variable assignment function cannot work empty domains variable assignment functions whose range empty similarly cannot assign interpretations constant symbols truth definition requires must select variable assignment function truth values even atomic formulas defined truth value sentence defined truth value variable assignment proved truth value depend assignment chosen technique work assignment functions must changed accommodate empty domains

thus empty domain permitted must often treated special case authors however simply exclude empty domain definition
deductive systemsedit
