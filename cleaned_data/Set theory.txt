georg cantor


mathematical topics typically emerge evolve interactions among many researchers theory however founded single paper 1874 georg cantor property collection real algebraic numbers12
since century beginning greek mathematician zeno elea west early indian mathematicians east mathematicians struggled concept infinity especially notable work bernard bolzano first half 19th century3 modern understanding infinity began 1867–71 cantors work number theory 1872 meeting cantor richard dedekind influenced cantors thinking culminated cantors 1874 paper
cantors work initially polarized mathematicians karl weierstrass dedekind supported cantor leopold kronecker seen founder mathematical constructivism cantorian theory eventually became widespread utility cantorian concepts onetoone correspondence among sets proof real numbers integers infinity infinities cantors paradise resulting power operation utility theory article mengenlehre contributed 1898 arthur schoenflies kleins encyclopedia
next wave excitement theory came around 1900 discovered interpretations cantorian theory gave rise several contradictions called antinomies paradoxes bertrand russell ernst zermelo independently found simplest best known paradox called russells paradox consider sets members leads contradiction since must member member 1899 cantor posed question cardinal number sets obtained related paradox russell used paradox theme 1903 review continental mathematics principles mathematics
1906 english readers gained book theory sets points4 husband wife william henry young grace chisholm young published cambridge university press
momentum theory debate paradoxes lead abandonment work zermelo 1908 abraham fraenkel 1922 resulted axioms became commonly used axioms theory work analysts henri lebesgue demonstrated great mathematical utility theory since become woven fabric modern mathematics theory commonly used foundational system although areaswhich category theory thought preferred foundation
basic concepts notationedit
main articles mathematics algebra sets
theory begins fundamental binary relation object member element notation used since sets objects membership relation relate sets well
derived binary relation sets subset relation also called inclusion members also members subset denoted example subset insinuated definition subset cases possibility unsuitable would make sense rejected term proper subset defined called proper subset subset equal note also members elements subsets turn subsets members
arithmetic features binary operations numbers theory features binary operations sets

union sets denoted objects member union
intersection sets denoted objects members intersection
difference denoted members members difference conversely difference subset difference also called complement case choice clear context notation sometimes used instead particularly universal study venn diagrams
symmetric difference sets denoted objects member exactly elements sets instance sets symmetric difference difference union intersection
cartesian product denoted whose members possible ordered pairs member member cartesian product white white white
power whose members possible subsets example power

basic sets central importance empty unique containing elements occasionally called null though name ambiguous natural numbers real numbers

axiomatic theoryedit
elementary theory studied informally intuitively taught primary schools using venn diagrams intuitive approach tacitly assumes formed class objects satisfying particular defining condition assumption gives rise paradoxes simplest best known russells paradox buraliforti paradox axiomatic theory originally devised theory paradoxes5
widely studied systems axiomatic theory imply sets form cumulative hierarchy systems come flavors whose ontology consists

sets alone includes common axiomatic theory zermelo–fraenkel theory includes axiom choice fragments include

zermelo theory replaces axiom schema replacement separation
general theory small fragment zermelo theory sufficient peano axioms finite sets
kripke–platek theory omits axioms infinity powerset choice weakens axiom schemata separation replacement


sets proper classes include neumann–bernays–gödel theory strength theorems sets alone morse–kelley theory tarski–grothendieck theory stronger
