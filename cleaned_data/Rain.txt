coalescence fragmentation




shape rain drops depending upon size


coalescence occurs water droplets fuse create larger water droplets resistance typically causes water droplets cloud remain stationary turbulence occurs water droplets collide producing larger droplets




black rain clouds


larger water droplets descend coalescence continues drops become heavy enough overcome resistance fall rain coalescence generally happens often clouds freezing also known warm rain process20 clouds freezing crystals gain enough mass begin fall generally requires mass coalescence occurring crystal neighboring water droplets process temperature dependent supercooled water droplets exist cloud freezing addition great temperature difference cloud ground level crystals melt fall become rain21
raindrops sizes ranging 00039 03543 mean diameter tend break smaller drops called cloud droplets shape spherical raindrop increases size shape becomes oblate largest crosssection facing oncoming airflow large rain drops become increasingly flattened bottom like hamburger buns large ones shaped like parachutes2223 contrary popular belief shape resemble teardrop24 biggest raindrops earth recorded brazil marshall islands 2004 large large size explained condensation large smoke particles collisions drops small regions particularly high content liquid water25
