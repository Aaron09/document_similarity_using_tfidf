human genome project 15yearlong publicly funded project initiated 1990 objective determining sequence entire euchromatic human genome within years4 1985 robert sinsheimer organized workshop discuss sequencing human genome5 number reasons uninterested pursuing proposal following march santa workshop organized charles delisi david smith department energys office health environmental research oher6 time renato dulbecco proposed whole genome sequencing essay science7 james watson followed months later workshop held cold spring harbor laboratory

human genome project started 1990 goal sequencing identifying three billion chemical units human genetic instruction finding genetic roots disease developing treatments considered mega project human genome approximately billion basepairs sequence hand next step identify genetic variants increase risk common diseases like cancer diabetes1533
expensive time think sequencing patients’ whole genomes national institutes health embraced idea shortcut look sites genome many people variant unit theory behind shortcut since major diseases common would genetic variants caused natural selection keeps human genome free variants damage health children grown theory held fails variants strike later life allowing become quite common 2002 national institutes health started million project called hapmap catalog common variants european east asian african genomes34
genome broken smaller pieces approximately 150000 base pairs length33 pieces ligated type vector known bacterial artificial chromosomes bacs derived bacterial chromosomes genetically engineered vectors containing genes inserted bacteria copied bacterial replication machinery pieces sequenced separately small shotgun project assembled larger 150000 base pairs together create chromosomes known hierarchical shotgun approach genome first broken relatively large chunks mapped chromosomes selected sequencing3536
funding came government national institutes health united states charity organization wellcome trust well numerous groups around world funding supported number large sequencing centers including whitehead institute sanger centre washington university louis baylor college medicine1637
united nations educational scientific cultural organization unesco served important channel involvement developing countries human genome project38
public versus private approachesedit
1998 similar privately funded quest launched american researcher craig venter firm celera genomics venter scientist early 1990s project initiated 300000000 celera effort intended proceed faster pace fraction cost roughly billion publicly funded project celera approach able proceed much rapid rate lower cost public project relied upon data made available publicly funded project39
celera used technique called whole genome shotgun sequencing employing pairwise sequencing40 used sequence bacterial genomes million base pairs length anything nearly large three billion base pair human genome
celera initially announced would seek patent protection 200–300 genes later amended seeking intellectual property protection fullycharacterized important structures amounting 100–300 targets firm eventually filed preliminary placeholder patent applications 6500 whole partial genes celera also promised publish findings accordance terms 1996 bermuda statement releasing data annually released data daily although unlike publicly funded project would permit free redistribution scientific data publicly funded competitors compelled release first draft human genome celera reason july 2000 ucsc genome bioinformatics group released first working draft scientific community downloaded information ucsc genome server first hours free unrestricted access41
march 2000 president clinton announced genome sequence could patented made freely available researchers statement sent celeras stock plummeting dragged biotechnologyheavy nasdaq biotechnology sector lost billion market capitalization days
although working draft announced june 2000 february 2001 celera scientists published details drafts special issues nature published publicly funded projects scientific paper42 science published celeras paper43 described methods used produce draft sequence offered analysis sequence drafts covered genome euchromatic regions 150000 gaps order orientation many segments established february 2001 time joint publications press releases announced project completed groups improved drafts announced 2003 2005 filling approximately sequence currently
genome donorsedit
ihgsc international publicsector researchers collected blood female sperm male samples large number donors many collected samples processed resources thus donor identities protected neither donors scientists could know whose sequenced clones many different libraries used overall project libraries created pieter jongs much sequence reference genome produced public came single anonymous male donor buffalo york code name rp114445
scientists used white blood cells blood male female donors randomly selected donor yielding separate library libraries rp11 used considerably others quality considerations minor technical issue male samples contain half much chromosomes chromosome chromosome compared female samples contain chromosomes chromosomes autosomes sexes
although main sequencing phase completed studies variation continue international hapmap project whose goal identify patterns singlenucleotide polymorphism groups called haplotypes “haps” samples hapmap came total individuals yoruba people ibadan nigeria japanese people tokyo chinese beijing french centre d’etude polymorphisme humain ceph resource consisted residents united states ancestry western northern europe
celera genomics privatesector project five different individuals used sequencing lead scientist celera genomics time craig venter later acknowledged public letter journal science samples pool five selected use4647
2007 team jonathan rothberg published james watsons entire genome unveiling sixbillionnucleotide genome single individual first time48

ethical legal social issuesedit
onset human genome project several ethical legal social concerns raised regards increased knowledge human genome could used discriminate people main concerns individuals fear employers health insurance companies would refuse hire individuals refuse provide insurance people health concern indicated someones genes53 1996 united states passed health insurance portability accountability hipaa protects unauthorized nonconsensual release individually identifiable health information entity actively engaged provision healthcare services patient54
along identifying approximately 20000–25000 genes human genome human genome project also sought address ethical legal social issues created onset project ethical legal social implications elsi program founded 1990 five percent annual budget allocated address elsi arising project1655 budget started approximately million year 1990 increased approximately million year 201456
whilst project offer significant benefits medicine scientific research authors emphasized need address potential social consequences mapping human genome molecularising disease possible cure profound impact patients expect medical help generation doctors perception illness57
