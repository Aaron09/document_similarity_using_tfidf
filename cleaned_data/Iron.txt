biological pathological role
main article human iron metabolism
iron involved numerous biological processes139140 important transition metal living organisms141 ironproteins found living organisms archaeans bacteria eukaryotes including humans example color blood hemoglobin ironcontaining protein illustrated hemoglobin iron often bound cofactors hemes nonprotein compounds often involving metal ions required proteins biological activity happen ironsulfur clusters pervasive include nitrogenase enzymes responsible biological nitrogen fixation main roles ironcontaining proteins transport storage oxygen well transfer electrons141

iron necessary trace element found nearly living organisms ironcontaining enzymes proteins often containing heme prosthetic groups participate many biological oxidations transport examples proteins found higher organisms include hemoglobin cytochrome highvalent iron catalase142 average adult human contains 0005 body weight iron four grams three quarters hemoglobin level remains constant despite milligram iron absorbed day141 human body recycles hemoglobin iron content143
biochemistry
iron acquisition poses problem aerobic organisms ferric iron poorly soluble near neutral thus organisms developed means absorb iron complexes sometimes taking ferrous iron oxidising back ferric iron particular bacteria evolved highaffinity sequestering agents called siderophores144145146
uptake human cells iron storage carefully regulated iron ions never free free iron ions high potential biological toxicity147 major component regulation protein transferrin binds iron ions absorbed duodenum carries blood cells148 transferrin contains middle distorted octahedron bonded nitrogen three oxygens chelating carbonate anion traps high stability constant effective taking ions even stable complexes bone marrow transferrin reduced stored ferritin incorporated hemoglobin141

hemoglobin oxygen carrier occurs blood cells contributes color transporting oxygen arteries lungs muscles transferred myoglobin stores needed metabolic oxidation glucose generates energy hemoglobin binds carbon dioxide produced glucose oxidized transported veins hemoglobin predominantly bicarbonate anions back lungs exhaled141 hemoglobin iron four heme groups possible coordination sites four occupied nitrogen atoms porphyrin ring fifth imidazole nitrogen histidine residue protein chains attached heme group sixth reserved oxygen molecule reversibly bind to141 hemoglobin attached oxygen called deoxyhemoglobin center heme group hydrophobic protein interior highspin configuration thus large inside porphyrin ring bends instead dome picometers configuration sixth coordination site reserved oxygen blocked another histidine residue141
deoxyhemoglobin picks oxygen molecule histidine residue moves away returns oxygen securely attached form hydrogen bond results switching lowspin configuration resulting decrease ionic radius porphyrin ring becomes planar141 additionally hydrogen bonding results tilting oxygen molecule resulting fe–o–o bond angle around 120° avoids formation fe–o–fe fe–o2–fe bridges would lead electron transfer oxidation destruction hemoglobin results movement protein chains leads subunits hemoglobin changing shape form larger oxygen affinity thus deoxyhemoglobin takes oxygen affinity oxygen increases vice versa141 myoglobin hand contains heme group hence cooperative effect cannot occur thus hemoglobin almost saturated oxygen high partial pressures oxygen found lungs affinity oxygen much lower myoglobin partial pressures oxygen found muscle tissue resulting oxygen transfer141 enhanced concomitant bohr effect named christian bohr father niels bohr lowered occurs carbon dioxide released muscles lowers oxygen affinity hemoglobin141

health diet
iron pervasive particularly rich sources dietary iron include meat lentils beans poultry fish leaf vegetables watercress tofu chickpeas blackeyed peas blackstrap molasses bread breakfast cereals sometimes specifically fortified iron iron amounts found molasses teff farina154155
