differentiation biological engineering biomedical engineering unclear many universities loosely terms bioengineering biomedical engineering interchangeably3 biomedical engineers specifically focused applying biological sciences toward medical innovations whereas biological engineers focused principally applying engineering principles biology necessarily medical uses hence neither biological engineering biomedical engineering wholly contained within nonbiological products medical needs well biological products nonmedical needs latter including notably biosystems engineering

historyedit
biological engineering sciencebased discipline founded upon biological sciences chemical engineering electrical engineering mechanical engineering4 based upon chemistry electricity magnetism classical mechanics respectively5
biological engineering differentiated roots pure biology engineering fields biological studies often follow reductionist approach viewing system smallest possible scale naturally leads toward development tools like functional genomics engineering approaches using classical design perspectives constructionist building devices approaches technologies component parts concepts biological engineering uses approaches concert relying reductionist approaches identify understand organize fundamental units integrated generate something new6 addition engineering discipline biological engineering fundamentally concerned basic science practical application scientific knowledge solve realworld problems costeffective
although engineered biological systems used manipulate information construct materials process chemicals produce energy provide food help maintain enhance human health environment ability quickly reliably engineer biological systems behave expected present less well developed mastery mechanical electrical systems7
abet8 usbased accreditation board engineering programs makes distinction biomedical engineering biological engineering though much overlap foundational courses often include thermodynamics fluid mechanical dynamics kinetics electronics materials properties910 according professor doug lauffenburger mit1112 biological engineering like biotechnology broader base applies engineering principles enormous range size complexities systems ranging molecular level molecular biology biochemistry microbiology pharmacology protein chemistry cytology immunology neurobiology neuroscience often always using biological substances cellular tissuebased methods including devices sensors whole macroscopic organisms plants animals increasing length scales whole ecosystems
word bioengineering coined british scientist broadcaster heinz wolff 195413 term bioengineering also used describe vegetation civil engineering construction term bioengineering also applied environmental modifications surface soil protection slope stabilization watercourse shoreline protection windbreaks vegetation barriers including noise barriers visual screens ecological enhancement area first biological engineering program created mississippi state university 1967 making first biological engineering curriculum united states14 recent programs launched utah state university15 emergent field biorobotics become prominent subdicipline bioengineering
