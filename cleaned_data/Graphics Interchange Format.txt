historyedit
compuserve introduced june 1987 provide color image format file downloading areas replacing earlier runlength encoding format black white became popular used data compression efficient runlength encoding formats macpaint used fairly large images could therefore downloaded reasonably short time even slow modems
original version called 87a1 1989 compuserve released enhanced version called 89a2 added support animation delays multiple images stream already supported transparent background colors storage applicationspecific metadata specification also supports incorporating text labels text embedding graphical data little control display fonts feature widely used versions distinguished looking first bytes file magic number signature interpreted ascii read gif87a gif89a respectively
compuserve encouraged adoption providing downloadable conversion utilities many computers december 1987 example apple iigs user could view pictures created atari commodore first image formats commonly used sites blackandwhite xbm4
september 1995 netscape navigator added ability animated gifs loop
feature storing multiple images file accompanied control data used extensively produce simple animations optional interlacing feature stores image scan lines order fashion even partially downloaded image somewhat recognizable also helped gifs popularity5 user could abort download required
2015 facebook added support even though originally support site67

conceptually file describes fixedsized graphical area logical screen populated zero images many files single image fills entire logical screen others divide logical screen separate subimages images also function animation frames animated file need fill entire logical screen
files start fixedlength header gif87a gif89a giving version followed fixedlength logical screen descriptor giving size characteristics logical screen screen descriptor also specify presence size global color table follows next present
thereafter file divided segments introduced 1byte sentinel

image introduced 0x2c comma
extension block introduced 0x21 exclamation point
trailer single byte value 0x3b semicolon last byte file

image starts fixedlength image descriptor specify presence size local color table follows next present image data follows byte giving width unencoded symbols must least bits wide even bicolor images followed linked list subblocks containing lzwencoded data
extension blocks blocks extend definition mechanism already defined spec consist sentinel additional byte specifying type extension linked list subblocks extension data extension blocks modify image like graphic control extension specifies optional animation delay time optional transparent background color must immediately precede segment image refer

example image saved websafe palette dithered using floyd–steinberg method reduced number colors image display issues


palettebased colors used image frame file values defined palette table hold entries data image refer colors indices 0–255 palette table color definitions palette drawn color space millions shades shades bits primary maximum number colors frame limitation seemed reasonable developed people could afford hardware display colors simultaneously simple graphics line drawings cartoons greyscale photographs typically need fewer colors
frame designate index transparent background color pixel assigned index takes color pixel position background determined previous frame animation
many techniques collectively called dithering developed approximate wider range colors small color palette using pixels colors approximate inbetween colors techniques sacrifice spatial resolution approximate deeper color resolution part specification dithering course used images subsequently encoded images often ideal solution images loss spatial resolution typically makes image look fuzzy screen dithering patterns often interfere compressibility image data working gifs main purpose
early days graphical browserswhen graphics cards 8bit buffers allowing colors common fairly common make images using websafe paletteaccording ensured predictable display severely limited choice colors 24bit color became norm palettes could instead populated optimum colors individual images
small color table suffice small images keeping color table small allows file downloaded faster specifications allow color tables colors graphics applications read display images table sizes support sizes creating images tables colors widely supported
true coloredit




animated illustrating technique displaying typical limit colors


although almost never used true color images possible so2324 image include multiple image blocks 256color palette blocks tiled create complete image alternatively gif89a specification introduced idea transparent color image block include palette visible colors plus transparent color complete image created layering image blocks visible portion layer showing transparent portions layers
render fullcolor image original image must broken smaller regions different colors regions stored separate image block local palette image blocks displayed together either tiling layering partially transparent image blocks complete fullcolor image appears example breaking image tiles pixels pixels total ensures tile local palette limit colors although larger tiles used similar colors merged resulting loss color information23
since image block requires local color table file lots image blocks large limiting usefulness fullcolor gifs24 additionally rendering programs handle tiled layered images correctly many rendering programs interpret tiles layers animation frames display sequence endless animation23 browsers automatically displaying frames delay time seconds more2526better source needed

code lengthsedit
shorter code lengths used palettes smaller colors example palette colors color indexes bits wide symbols range symbol width taken bits codes starting bits fact symbol width need match palette size long values decoded always less number colors palette symbols width palette size power example first four colors values palette used symbols taken bits wide codes starting bits
conversely symbol width could even values used data would require 2color table although would point encoding file something similar typically happens bicolor images minimum symbol width even values used
code table initially contains codes longer symbol size order accommodate special codes codes strings added process table full code length increases give space strings maximum code 4095 fffhex decoder builds table tracks increases code length able unpack incoming bytes accordingly
uncompressed gifedit




uncompressed 7bit symbols colors 8bit codes click image explanation code


encoding process modified create file without compression still viewable image technique introduced originally avoid patent infringement uncompressed also useful intermediate format graphics programmer individual pixels accessible reading painting uncompressed file converted ordinary file simply passing image editor
modified encoding method ignores building table emits root palette codes codes clear stop yields simpler encoding 1to1 correspondence code values palette codes sacrifices compression pixel image generates output code indicating color index processing uncompressed standard decoder prevented writing strings dictionary table code width must never increase since triggers different packing bits bytes
symbol width codes width fall naturally blocks lower block codes coding single symbols upper block codes used decoder sequences length greater upper block first codes already taken clear stop decoder must also prevented using last code upper block decoder fills slot increase code width thus upper block codes available decoder wont trigger increase code width decoder always step behind maintaining table generate table entry upon receiving first code encoder generate succeeding code thus encoder generate codes without triggering increase code width therefore encoder must emit extra clear codes intervals codes less make decoder reset coding dictionary standard allows extra clear codes inserted image data time composite data stream partitioned subblocks carry bytes
