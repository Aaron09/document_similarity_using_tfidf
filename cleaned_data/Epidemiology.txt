etymologyedit
epidemiology literally meaning study upon people derived greek meaning upon among demos meaning people district logos meaning study word discourse suggesting applies human populations however term widely used studies zoological populations veterinary epidemiology although term epizoology available also applied studies plant populations botanical plant disease epidemiology2
distinction epidemic endemic first drawn hippocrates3 distinguish diseases visited upon population epidemic reside within population endemic4 term epidemiology appears first used describe study epidemics 1802 spanish physician villalba epidemiología española4 epidemiologists also study interaction diseases population condition known syndemic
term epidemiology widely applied cover description causation epidemic disease disease general even many nondisease healthrelated conditions high blood pressure obesity therefore epidemiology based upon pattern disease cause changes function everyone

original john snow showing clusters cholera cases london epidemic 1854


john graunt haberdasher amateur statistician published natural political observations upon bills mortality 1662 analysed mortality rolls london great plague presented first life tables reported time trends many diseases provided statistical evidence many theories disease also refuted widespread ideas
john snow famous investigations causes 19th century cholera epidemics also known father modern epidemiology1011 began noticing significantly higher death rates areas supplied southwark company identification broad street pump cause soho epidemic considered classic example epidemiology snow used chlorine attempt clean water removed handle ended outbreak perceived major event history public health regarded founding event science epidemiology helped shape public health policies around world1213 however snow’s research preventive measures avoid outbreaks fully accepted practice death
pioneers include danish physician peter anton schleisner 1849 related work prevention epidemic neonatal tetanus vestmanna islands iceland1415 another important pioneer hungarian physician ignaz semmelweis 1847 brought infant mortality vienna hospital instituting disinfection procedure findings published 1850 work illreceived colleagues discontinued procedure disinfection become widely practiced british surgeon joseph lister discovered antiseptics 1865 light work louis pasteur
early 20th century mathematical methods introduced epidemiology ronald ross janet laneclaypon anderson gray mckendrick others16171819

late 20th century advancement biomedical sciences number molecular markers blood biospecimens environment identified predictors development risk certain disease epidemiology research examine relationship biomarkers analyzed molecular level disease broadly named “molecular epidemiology” specifically genetic epidemiology used epidemiology germline genetic variation disease genetic variation typically determined using peripheral blood leukocytes since 2000s genomewide association studies gwas commonly performed identify genetic risk factors many diseases health conditions
molecular epidemiology studies still using conventional disease diagnosis classification systems increasingly recognized disease evolution represents inherently heterogeneous processes differing person person conceptually individual unique disease process different individual “the unique disease principle”2021 considering uniqueness exposome totality endogenous exogenous environmental exposures unique influence molecular pathologic process individual studies examine relationship exposure molecular pathologic signature disease particularly cancer became increasingly common throughout 2000s however molecular pathology epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack research guidelines standardized statistical methodologies paucity interdisciplinary experts training programs22 furthermore concept disease heterogeneity appears conflict longstanding premise epidemiology individuals disease name similar etiologies disease processes resolve issues advance population health science molecular precision medicine “molecular pathology” “epidemiology” integrated create interdisciplinary field “molecular pathological epidemiology” mpe2324 defined “epidemiology molecular pathology heterogeneity disease” investigators analyze relationships environmental dietary lifestyle genetic factors alterations cellular extracellular molecules evolution progression disease better understanding heterogeneity disease pathogenesis contribute elucidate etiologies disease approach applied neoplastic diseases also nonneoplastic diseases25 concept paradigm become widespread 2010s26272829303132
types studiesedit
main article study design
epidemiologists employ range study designs observational experimental generally categorized descriptive analytic aiming examine known associations hypothesized relationships experimental term often equated clinical community trials treatments interventions observational studies nature allowed “take course epidemiologists observe sidelines conversely experimental studies epidemiologist control factors entering certain case study33 epidemiological studies aimed possible revealing unbiased relationships exposures alcohol smoking biological agents stress chemicals mortality morbidity identification causal relationships exposures outcomes important aspect epidemiology modern epidemiologists informatics tool
observational studies components descriptive analytical descriptive observations pertain “who healthrelated state occurrence” however analytical observations deal ‘how’ healthrelated event33 experimental epidemiology contains three case types randomized controlled trials often used medicine drug testing field trials conducted high risk contracting disease community trials research social originating diseases33
term epidemiologic triad used describe intersection host agent environment analyzing outbreak
case seriesedit
caseseries refer qualitative study experience single patient small group patients similar diagnosis statistical factor potential produce illness periods unexposed
former type study purely descriptive cannot used make inferences general population patients disease types studies astute clinician identifies unusual feature disease patients history lead formulation hypothesis using data series analytic studies could done investigate possible causal factors include case control studies prospective studies case control study would involve matching comparable controls without disease cases series prospective study would involve following case series time evaluate diseases natural history34
latter type formally described selfcontrolled caseseries studies divide individual patient followup time exposed unexposed periods fixedeffects poisson regression processes compare incidence rate given outcome exposed unexposed periods technique extensively used study adverse reactions vaccination shown circumstances provide statistical power comparable available cohort studies
casecontrol studiesedit

prospective studies many benefits case control studies powerful effect measure estimation since true incidence cannot calculated case control study subjects selected based disease status temporality established prospective study confounders easily controlled however costly greater chance losing subjects followup based long time period cohort followed
cohort studies also limited equation number cases cohort studies base incidence rate study population number cases required reduced
outbreak investigationedit

information investigation infectious disease outbreaks please outbreak investigation

causal inferenceedit
main article causal inference
although epidemiology sometimes viewed collection statistical tools used elucidate associations exposures health outcomes deeper understanding science discovering causal relationships
correlation imply causation common theme much epidemiological literature epidemiologists term inference correlation least association variables necessary sufficient criteria inference variable causes epidemiologists gathered data broad range biomedical psychosocial theories iterative generate expand theory test hypotheses make educated informed assertions relationships causal exactly causal
epidemiologists emphasize cause effect understanding simplistic misbeliefcitation needed outcomes whether disease death caused chain consisting many component causes35 causes distinguished necessary sufficient probabilistic conditions necessary condition identified controlled antibodies disease agent energy injury harmful outcome avoided robertson 2015
bradford hill criteriaedit
main article bradford hill criteria
1965 austin bradford hill proposed series considerations help assess evidence causation36 come commonly known bradford hill criteria contrast explicit intentions author hills considerations sometimes taught checklist implemented assessing causality37 hill said none nine viewpoints bring indisputable evidence causeandeffect hypothesis none required sine non36

strength association small association mean causal effect though larger association likely causal36
consistency data consistent findings observed different persons different places different samples strengthens likelihood effect36
specificity causation likely specific population specific site disease likely explanation specific association factor effect bigger probability causal relationship36
temporality effect occur cause expected delay cause expected effect effect must occur delay36
biological gradient greater exposure generally lead greater incidence effect however cases mere presence factor trigger effect cases inverse proportion observed greater exposure leads lower incidence36
plausibility plausible mechanism cause effect helpful hill noted knowledge mechanism limited current knowledge36
coherence coherence epidemiological laboratory findings increases likelihood effect however hill noted lack laboratory evidence cannot nullify epidemiological effect associations36
experiment occasionally possible appeal experimental evidence36
analogy effect similar factors considered36

legal interpretationedit
epidemiological studies prove agent could caused cause effect particular case

epidemiology concerned incidence disease populations address question cause individuals disease question sometimes referred specific causation beyond domain science epidemiology epidemiology limits point inference made relationship agent disease causal general causation magnitude excess risk attributed agent determined epidemiology addresses whether agent cause disease whether agent cause specific plaintiffs disease38

united states epidemiology alone cannot prove causal association exist general conversely circumstances taken courts individual case justify inference causal association exist based upon balance probability
subdiscipline forensic epidemiology directed investigation specific causation disease injury individuals groups individuals instances causation disputed unclear presentation legal settings
populationbased health managementedit
epidemiological practice results epidemiological analysis make significant contribution emerging populationbased health management frameworks
populationbased health management encompasses ability

assess health states health needs target population
implement evaluate interventions designed improve health population
efficiently effectively provide care members population consistent communitys cultural policy health resource values

modern populationbased health management complex requiring multiple skills medical political technological mathematical epidemiological practice analysis core component unified management science provide efficient effective health care health guidance population task requires forward looking ability modern risk management approaches transform health risk factors incidence prevalence mortality statistics derived epidemiological analysis management metrics guide health system responds current population health issues also health system managed better respond future potential population health issues39
examples organizations populationbased health management leverage work results epidemiological practice include canadian strategy cancer control health canada tobacco control programs rick hansen foundation canadian tobacco control research initiative404142

applied field epidemiologyedit
applied epidemiology practice using epidemiological methods protect improve health population applied field epidemiology include investigating communicable noncommunicable disease outbreaks mortality morbidity rates nutritional status among indicators health purpose communicating results implement appropriate policies disease control measures
humanitarian contextedit
surveillance reporting diseases health factors becomes increasingly difficult humanitarian crisis situations methodologies used report data compromised study found less half nutrition surveys sampled humanitarian contexts correctly calculated prevalence malnutrition onethird surveys criteria quality among mortality surveys criteria quality nutritional status mortality rates help indicate severity crisis tracking reporting health factors crucial
vital registries usually effective ways collect data humanitarian contexts registries nonexistent unreliable inaccessible mortality often inaccurately measured using either prospective demographic surveillance retrospective mortality surveys prospective demographic surveillance requires lots manpower difficult implement spreadout population retrospective morality surveys prone selection reporting biases methods developed common practice

validity precision biasedit
different fields epidemiology different levels validity assess validity findings ratio falsepositives claimed effects correct falsenegatives studies fail support true effect take field genetic epidemiology candidategene studies produced falsepositive findings falsenegative contrast genomewide association appear close reverse false positive every falsenegatives43 ratio improved time genetic epidemiology field adopted stringent criteria contrast epidemiological fields required rigorous reporting much less reliable result43
random erroredit
random error result fluctuations around true value sampling variability random error random occur data collection coding transfer analysis examples random error include poorly worded questions misunderstanding interpreting individual answer particular respondent typographical error coding random error affects measurement transient inconsistent manner impossible correct random error
random error sampling procedures called sampling error
precision epidemiological variables measure random error precision also inversely related random error reduce random error increase precision confidence intervals computed demonstrate precision relative risk estimates narrower confidence interval precise relative risk estimate
basic ways reduce random error epidemiological study first increase sample size study words subjects study second reduce variability measurement study might accomplished using precise measuring device increasing number measurements
note sample size number measurements increased precise measuring tool purchased costs study usually increased usually uneasy balance need adequate precision practical issue study cost
systematic erroredit
systematic error bias occurs difference true value population observed value study cause sampling variability example systematic error unknown pulse oximeter using incorrectly adds points true value time measurement taken measuring device could precise accurate error happens every instance systematic conclusions draw based data still incorrect error reproduced future using misset instrument
mistake coding affects responses particular question another example systematic error
validity study dependent degree systematic error validity usually separated components

internal validity dependent amount error measurements including exposure disease associations variables good internal validity implies lack error measurement suggests inferences drawn least pertain subjects study
external validity pertains process generalizing findings study population sample drawn even beyond population universal statement requires understanding conditions relevant irrelevant generalization internal validity clearly prerequisite external validity

selection biasedit
selection bias occurs study subjects selected become part study result third unmeasured variable associated exposure outcome interest44 instance repeatedly noted cigarette smokers smokers tend differ study participation rates sackett cites example seltzer smokers smokers returned mailed questionnaires45 important note difference response lead bias also associated systematic difference outcome response groups
information biasedit
information bias bias arising systematic error assessment variable46 example recall bias typical example provided sackett discussion study examining effect specific exposures fetal health questioning mothers whose recent pregnancies ended fetal death malformation cases matched group mothers whose pregnancies ended normally controls found former latter reported exposure drugs could substantiated either earlier prospective interviews health records45 example recall bias probably occurred result women miscarriages apparent tendency better recall therefore report previous exposures
confoundingedit
confounding traditionally defined bias arising cooccurrence mixing effects extraneous factors referred confounders main effects interest4647 recent definition confounding invokes notion counterfactual effects47 according view observes outcome interest opposed given population entirely exposed exposure every unit population risk event counterfactual unobserved risk corresponds risk would observed individuals unexposed every unit population true effect exposure therefore interested risk differences ra1ra0 interested relative risk since counterfactual risk unobservable approximate using second population actually measure following relations ra1rb0 situation confounding occurs rb047 example assumes binary outcome exposure variables
epidemiologists prefer think confounding separately common categorizations bias since unlike selection information bias confounding stems real causal effects44
professionedit
date universities offer epidemiology course study undergraduate level notable undergraduate program exists johns hopkins university students major public health take graduate level courses including epidemiology senior year bloomberg school public health48
although epidemiologic research conducted individuals diverse disciplines including clinically trained professionals physicians formal training available masters doctoral programs including master public health master science epidemiology doctor public health drph doctor pharmacy pharmd doctor philosophy doctor science many graduate programs doctor social work doctor clinical practice dclinp doctor podiatric medicine doctor veterinary medicine doctor nursing practice doctor physical therapy clinically trained physicians doctor medicine bachelor medicine surgery mbbs mbchb doctor osteopathic medicine include training epidemiologic research related topics training generally substantially less offered training programs focused epidemiology public health reflecting strong historical epidemiology medicine formal training programs either schools public health medical schools
