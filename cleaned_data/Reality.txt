philosophers believe techniques high scientists think mathematical approach philosophy needed instance stephen hawking wrote brief history time even would necessarily equations wrote breathes fire equations makes universe describe9
phenomenological reality
much broader subjective levelspecify private experiences curiosity inquiry selectivity involved personal interpretation events shapes reality seen individualcitation needed hence called phenomenological form reality might common others well could times also unique oneself never experienced agreed upon anyone else much kind experience deemed spiritual occurs level reality
phenomenology philosophical method developed early years twentieth century edmund husserl circle followers universities göttingen munich germany subsequently phenomenological themes taken philosophers france united states elsewhere often contexts removed husserls work
word phenomenology comes greek phainómenon meaning appears lógos meaning study husserls conception phenomenology primarily concerned making structures consciousness phenomena appear acts consciousness objects systematic reflection analysis reflection take place highly modified first person viewpoint studying phenomena appear consciousness consciousness whatsoever husserl believed phenomenology could thus provide firm basis human knowledge including scientific knowledge could establish philosophy rigorous science10

realism locality physics
realism sense used physicists equate realism metaphysics14 latter claim world mindindependent even results measurement preexist measurement require creation observer furthermore mindindependent property value physical variable position momentum property dispositional potential tendency glass objects tend break disposed break even actually break likewise mindindependent properties quantum systems could consist tendency respond particular measurements particular values ascertainable probability15 ontology would metaphysically realistic without realistic physicists sense local realism would require single value produced certainty

local realism significant feature classical mechanics general relativity electrodynamics quantum mechanics shown quantum entanglement possible rejected einstein proposed paradox subsequently quantified bells inequalities16 bells inequalities violated either local realism counterfactual definiteness must incorrect physicists dispute experiments demonstrated bells violations grounds subclass inhomogeneous bell inequalities tested experimental limitations tests different interpretations quantum mechanics violate different parts local realism andor counterfactual definiteness
role observer quantum mechanics
also quantum decoherence
quantum mind–body problem refers philosophical discussions mind–body problem context quantum mechanics since quantum mechanics involves quantum superpositions perceived observers interpretations quantum mechanics place conscious observers special position
founders quantum mechanics debated role observer wolfgang pauli werner heisenberg believed observer produced collapse point view never fully endorsed niels bohr denounced mystical antiscientific albert einstein pauli accepted term described quantum mechanics lucid mysticism17
heisenberg bohr always described quantum mechanics logical positivist terms bohr also took active interest philosophical implications quantum theories complementarity example18 believed quantum theory offers complete description nature albeit simply illsuited everyday experiences better described classical mechanics probability bohr never specified demarcation line objects cease quantum become classical believed question physics philosophy
eugene wigner reformulated schrödingers thought experiment wigners friend proposed consciousness observer demarcation line precipitates collapse wave function independent realist interpretation commonly known consciousness causes collapse interpretation quantum mechanics states observation conscious observer makes wave function collapse
