early historyedit
humans first acquired knowledge waves currents seas oceans prehistoric times observations tides recorded aristotle strabo early exploration oceans primarily cartography mainly limited surfaces animals fishermen brought nets though depth soundings lead line taken
although juan ponce león 1513 first identified gulf stream current wellknown mariners benjamin franklin made first scientific study gave name franklin measured water temperatures several atlantic crossings correctly explained gulf streams cause franklin timothy folger printed first gulf stream 1769177012




1799 currents atlantic indian oceans james rennell


information currents pacific ocean gathered explorers late 18th century including james cook louis antoine bougainville james rennell wrote first scientific textbooks oceanography detailing current flows atlantic indian oceans voyage around cape good hope 1777 mapped banks currents lagullas also first understand nature intermittent current near isles scilly known rennells current3
james clark ross took first modern sounding deep 1840 charles darwin published paper reefs formation atolls result second voyage beagle 18316 robert fitzroy published fourvolume report beagles three voyages 1841–1842 edward forbes undertook dredging aegean founded marine ecology
first superintendent united states naval observatory 1842–1861 matthew fontaine maury devoted time study marine meteorology navigation charting prevailing winds currents 1855 textbook physical geography first comprehensive oceanography studies many nations sent oceanographic observations maury naval observatory colleagues evaluated information distributed results worldwide4
modern oceanographyedit
despite human knowledge oceans remained confined topmost fathoms water small amount bottom mainly shallow areas almost nothing known ocean depths royal navys efforts chart worlds coastlines mid19th century reinforced vague idea ocean deep although little known exploration ignited popular scientific interest polar regions africa mysteries unexplored oceans

ocean acidificationedit
main article ocean acidification
ocean acidification describes decrease ocean caused anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions atmosphere13 seawater slightly alkaline preindustrial recently anthropogenic activities steadily increased carbon dioxide content atmosphere 30–40 added absorbed oceans forming carbonic acid lowering 8114 ocean acidification151617 expected reach year 210018
important element skeletons marine animals calcium calcium carbonate becomes soluble pressure carbonate shells skeletons dissolve carbonate compensation depth19 calcium carbonate becomes soluble lower ocean acidification likely affect marine organisms calcareous shells oysters clams urchins corals2021 carbonate compensation depth rise closer surface affected planktonic organisms include pteropods coccolithophorids foraminifera important food chain tropical regions corals likely severely affected become less able build calcium carbonate skeletons22 turn adversely impacting reef dwellers18
