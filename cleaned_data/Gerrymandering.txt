primary goals gerrymandering maximize effect supporters votes minimize effect opponents votes accomplished number ways16

cracking involves spreading voters particular type among many districts order deny sufficiently large voting bloc particular district16 example would split voters urban area among several districts wherein majority voters suburban presumption groups would vote differently suburban voters would likely elections
packing concentrate many voters type single electoral district reduce influence districts16 cases done obtain representation community common interest create majorityminority district rather dilute interest several districts point ineffectiveness minority groups involved avoid likely lawsuits charging racial discrimination party controlling districting process statewide majority packing usually necessary attain partisan advantage minority party generally cracked everywhere packing therefore likely used partisan advantage party controlling districting process statewide minority forfeiting districts packed opposition cracking used forming remaining districts
hijacking redraws districts force incumbents district ensuring eliminated16
kidnapping moves incumbents home address another district16 reelection become difficult incumbent longer resides district possibly faces reelection district voter base often employed politicians represent multiple urban areas larger cities removed district order make district rural

tactics typically combined form creating forfeit seats packed voters type order secure seats greater representation voters another type results candidates party responsible gerrymandering winning small majorities districts another party winning large majority districts

gerrymandering influence electoral results nonproportional system state equally sized districts voters parties plum squares orange circles

creating mixedtype districts yields plum—a disproportional result considering statewide plum majority

orange wins urban district plum wins rural districts—the result reflects statewide vote ratio

gerrymandering techniques ensure statewide minority orange party


political science research suggests contrary common belief gerrymandering decrease electoral competition even increase rather packing voters party uncompetitive districts party leaders tend prefer spread partys voters multiple districts party larger number races21 scenario lead increased competition instead gerrymandering researchers find factors partisan polarization incumbency advantage driven recent decreases electoral competition22 similarly 2009 study found congressional polarization primarily function differences democrats republicans represent districts rather function districts party represents distribution constituency preferences23

mann senior fellow governance studies brookings institution also noted redistricting deeply political process incumbents actively seeking minimize risk bipartisan gerrymanders gain additional seats party partisan gerrymanders26 bipartisan gerrymandering mann mentions refers fact legislators often also draw distorted legislative districts even redistricting provide advantage party
gerrymandering state legislative districts effectively guarantee incumbent’s victory ‘shoring district higher levels partisan support without disproportionately benefiting particular political party highly problematic governance perspective forming districts ensure high levels partisanship often leads higher levels partisanship legislative bodies substantial number districts designed polarized districts representation also likely heavily partisan manner create perpetuate partisan gridlock

gerrymandering also significant effects representation received voters gerrymandered districts gerrymandering designed increase number wasted votes among electorate relative representation particular groups drastically altered actual share voting population effect significantly prevent gerrymandered system achieving proportional descriptive representation winners elections increasingly determined drawing districts rather preferences voters
gerrymandering advocated improve representation within legislature among otherwise underrepresented minority groups packing single district controversial lead groups remaining marginalised government become confined single district candidates outside district longer need represent elections
example much redistricting conducted united states early 1990s involved intentional creation additional majorityminority districts racial minorities african americans packed majority maximization policy drew support republican party limited support among african americans could concentrate power elsewhere minority representatives elected democrats constituencies safe seats

changing voting systemedit
gerrymandering relies wastedvote effect different voting system fewer wasted votes help reduce gerrymandering particular multimember districts alongside voting systems establishing proportional representation single transferable voting reduce wasted votes gerrymandering semiproportional voting systems single nontransferable vote cumulative voting relatively simple similar first past post also reduce proportion wasted votes thus potential gerrymandering electoral reformers advocated three replacement systems39
electoral systems various forms proportional representation found nearly european countries resulting multiparty systems many parties represented parliaments higher voter attendance elections40 fewer wasted votes wider variety political opinions represented
electoral systems election winner district winnertakesall electoral systems proportional distribution extra mandates smaller parties tend create twoparty systems duvergers parties effectively compete national elections thus national political discussions forced narrow twoparty frame loyalty forced statements inside parties distort political debateaccording
changing size districts elected bodyedit
proportional semiproportional voting system used increasing number winners given district reduce number wasted votes accomplished merging separate districts together increasing total size body elected since gerrymandering relies exploiting wasted vote effect increasing number winners district reduce potential gerrymandering proportional systems unless districts merged however method cannot eliminate gerrymandering entirely
contrast proportional methods nonproportional voting system multiple winners block voting used increasing size elected body keeping number districts constant reduce amount wasted votes leaving potential gerrymandering merging districts together system reduce potential gerrymandering also amplifies tendency block voting produce landslide victories creating similar effect gerrymandering concentrating wasted votes among opposition denying representation
system singlewinner elections used increasing size elected body implicitly increase number districts created change actually make gerrymandering easier raising number singlewinner elections opposition groups efficiently packed smaller districts without accidentally including supporters increasing number wasted votes amongst opposition
using fixed districtsedit
another avoid gerrymandering simply stop redistricting altogether existing political boundaries state county provincial lines prevents future gerrymandering existing advantage become deeply ingrained united states senate instance competitive elections house representatives existing state borders rather gerrymandered districts—senators elected entire state representatives elected legislatively drawn districts
fixed districts creates additional problem however fixed districts take account changes population individual voters come different degrees influence legislative process malapportionment greatly affect representation long periods time large population movements united kingdom industrial revolution several constituencies fixed since gained representation parliament england became small could handful voters rotten boroughs similarly state legislature alabama refused redistrict years despite major changes population patterns 1960 less quarter states population controlled majority seats legislature41 however practice using fixed districts state legislatures effectively banned united states reynolds sims supreme court decision 1964 establishing rule vote
