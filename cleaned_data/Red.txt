sunset




sunsets sunrises often optical effect called rayleigh scattering


white sunlight travels atmosphere colors scattered beam molecules airborne particles rayleigh scattering changing final color beam seen colors shorter wavelength blue green scatter strongly removed light finally reaches eye19 sunrise sunset path sunlight atmosphere longest blue green components removed almost completely leaving longer wavelength orange light remaining reddened sunlight also scattered cloud droplets relatively large particles give horizon glow20
lasers
lasers emitting region spectrum available since invention ruby laser 1960 1962 helium–neon laser invented21 types lasers widely used many scientific applications including holography education helium–neon lasers used commercially laserdisc players laser diodes became widespread commercial success modern players laser diode technology today redorange laser diodes widely available public form extremely inexpensive laser pointers portable highpowered versions also available various applications22 recently diodepumped solid state dpss lasers introduced market alldpss laser display systems particle image velocimetry raman spectroscopy holography23

astronomy

mars called planet reddish color imparted surface abundant iron oxide present there25
astronomical objects moving away observer exhibit doppler shift
jupiters surface displays great spot caused ovalshaped mega storm south planets equator26
giants stars exhausted supply hydrogen cores switched thermonuclear fusion hydrogen shell surrounds core radii tens hundreds times larger however outer envelope much lower temperature giving orange despite lower energy density envelope giants many times luminous large size
supergiants like betelgeuse antares biggest variety giants huge size radii times greater relatively cool temperature 35004500 causing distinct tint shrinking rapidly size surrounded envelope skin much bigger star envelope betelgeuse times bigger star inside
dwarf small relatively cool star mass less half surface temperature less 4000 dwarfs common type star galaxy luminosity earth none visible naked eye27

autumn leaves produced pigments called anthocyanins present leaf throughout growing season actively produced towards summer4 develop late summer cells leaf development result complex interactions many influences—both inside outside plant formation depends breakdown sugars presence bright light level phosphate leaf reduced36
summer growing season phosphate high level vital role breakdown sugars manufactured chlorophyll fall phosphate along chemicals nutrients moves leaf stem plant happens sugarbreakdown process changes leading production anthocyanin pigments brighter light period greater production anthocyanins brilliant resulting color display days autumn bright cool nights chilly freezing brightest colorations usually develop
anthocyanins temporarily color edges young leaves unfold buds early spring also give familiar color common fruits cranberries apples blueberries cherries raspberries plums
