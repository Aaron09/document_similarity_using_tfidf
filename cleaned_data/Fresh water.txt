sourcesedit

coastal areas fresh water contain significant concentrations salts derived windy conditions lifted drops seawater rainbearing clouds give rise elevated concentrations sodium chloride magnesium sulfate well many compounds smaller concentrations
desert areas areas impoverished dusty soils rainbearing winds pick sand dust deposited elsewhere precipitation causing freshwater flow measurably contaminated insoluble solids also soluble components soils significant quantities iron transported including welldocumented transfer ironrich rainfall falling brazil derived sandstorms sahara north africa

aquatic organismsedit
fresh water creates hypotonic environment aquatic organisms problematic organisms pervious skins gill membranes whose cell membranes burst excess water excreted protists accomplish using contractile vacuoles freshwater fish excrete excess water kidney8 although aquatic organisms limited ability regulate osmotic balance therefore live within narrow range salinity diadromous fish ability migrate fresh water saline water bodies migrations undergo changes adapt surroundings changed salinities processes hormonally controlled anguilla anguilla uses hormone prolactin9 salmon salmo salar hormone cortisol plays role process10
many birds special glands base bill excess salt excreted similarly marine iguanas galápagos islands excrete excess salt nasal gland sneeze salty excretion
freshwater molluscs include freshwater snails freshwater bivalves freshwater crustaceans include freshwater crabs others
fresh water resourceedit

important concern hydrological ecosystems securing minimum streamflow especially preserving restoring instream water allocations11 fresh water important natural resource necessary survival ecosystems water humans activities irrigation industrial applications adverse impacts downstream ecosystems chemical contamination fresh water also seriously damage ecosystems
pollution human activity including spills also presents problem freshwater resources largest petroleum spill ever occurred fresh water caused royal dutch shell tank ship magdalena argentina january 1999 polluting environment drinkable water plants animals12
fresh unpolluted water accounts 0003 total water available globally13
agricultureedit
changing landscape agriculture great effect flow fresh water changes landscape removal trees soils changes flow fresh water local environment also affects cycle fresh water result fresh water stored soil benefits agriculture however since agriculture human activity consumes fresh water14 severe strain local freshwater resources resulting destruction local ecosystems australia overabstraction fresh water intensive irrigation activities caused land area risk salination14 regards agriculture world bank targets food production water management increasingly global issue foster debate15
limited resourceedit
fresh water renewable variable finite natural resource fresh water replenished process water cycle water seas lakes forests land rivers reservoirs evaporates forms clouds returns precipitation locally however fresh water consumed human activities naturally restored result reduced fresh water availability surface underground sources cause serious damage surrounding associated environments
fresh water withdrawaledit
fresh water withdrawal quantity water removed available sources purpose excluding evaporation losses water drawn necessarily entirely consumed portion returned downstream
causes limited fresh wateredit
increase world population increase capita water puts increasing strains finite resources avialability clean fresh water world bank adds response freshwater ecosystems changing climate described terms three interrelated components water quality water quantity volume water timing change often leads shifts others well16 water pollution subsequent eutrophication also reduces availability fresh water17
fresh water futureedit
