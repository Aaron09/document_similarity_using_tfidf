plain text rich textedit
files contain markup metadata generally considered plaintext long entirety remains directly humanreadable form html coombs renear derose argue1 punctuation markup plain text rather bitstreams express markup enables files survive much better wild part making largely immune computer architecture incompatibilities
according unicode standard

plain text pure sequence character codes plain ueencoded text therefore sequence unicode character codes
styled text also known rich text text representation containing plain text completed information language identifier font size color hypertext links2

instance rich text sgml html wiki markup rely plain text
according unicode standard plain text main properties regard rich text

plain text underlying content stream formatting applied
plain text public standardized universally readable2

plain text unicode definitionedit
unicode definition plain text

plain text represents basic interchangeable content text
plain text represents character content appearance
displayed variety ways requires rendering process make visible particular appearance
plain text sequence given disparate rendering processes expectation rendered text instance appearance
instead disparate rendering processes simply required make text legible according intended reading
legibility criterion constrains range possible appearances
relationship appearance content plain text summarized follows plain text must contain enough information permit text rendered legibly nothing
unicode standard encodes plain text
distinction plain text forms data data stream function higherlevel protocol specified unicode standard itself3

usageedit
purpose using plain text today primarily independence programs require special encoding formatting file format plain text files opened read edited countless text editors utilities
commandline interface allows people give commands plain text response also plain text
many computer programs also capable processing creating plain text countless programs windows classic unix well browsers browsers lynx line mode browser produce plain text display etext readers
plain text files almost universal programming source code file containing instructions programming language almost always plain text file plain text also commonly used configuration files read saved settings startup program
plain text used much email
comment file record generally contains plain text without formatting intended humans read
best format storing knowledge persistently plain text rather binary format4
encodingedit
character encodingsedit
main article character encoding
early 1960s computers mainly used numbercrunching rather text memory extremely expensive computers often allocated bits character permitting characters—assigning codes would leave codes nowhere near enough computers opted support lowercase letters thus early text projects roberto busas index thomisticus brown corpus others resort conventions keying asterisk preceding letters actually intended uppercase
fred brooks argued strongly going 8bit bytes someday people might want process text although used ebcdic text came encoded ascii using values nonprinting control characters values graphic characters letters digits punctuation machines stored characters bits rather ignoring remaining using checksum
nearubiquity ascii great help failed address international linguistic concerns dollarsign useful england accented characters used spanish french german many languages entirely unavailable ascii mention characters used greek russian eastern languages many individuals companies countries defined extra characters needed—often reassigning control characters using value range using values conflicts using checksum checksum usage gradually died
additional characters encoded differently different countries making texts impossible decode without figuring originators rules instance browser might display rather tried interpret character another international organisation standardisation eventually developed several code pages 8859 accommodate various languages first 88591 also known aslatin1 covers needs european languages latinbased characters quite enough room cover 2022 provided conventions forswitching different character sets midfile many organisations developed variations many years windows macintosh computers used incompatible variations
textencoding situation became complex leading efforts unicode consortium develop single unified character encoding could cover known least currently known languages conflictcitation needed efforts unified unicode currently allows 1114112 code values assigns codes covering nearly modern text writing systems well many historical ones many nonlinguistic characters printers dingbats mathematical symbols
text considered plaintext regardless encoding properly understand process recipient must know able figure encoding used however need know anything computer architecture used binary structures defined whatever program created data
perhaps common explicitly stating specific encoding plain text mime type email http default mime type textplain plain text without markup another mime type often used email http texthtml charsetutf8 plain text represented using utf8 character encoding html markup another common mime type applicationjson plain text represented using utf8 character encoding json markup
document received without explicit indication character encoding applications charset detection attempt guess encoding used
control codesedit
main article control codes
ascii reserves first codes numbers 0–31 decimal control characters known codes originally intended represent printable information rather control devices printers make ascii provide metainformation data streams stored magnetic tape include common characters like newline character
8bit character sets latin1 8859 sets first characters upper half also control codes known rarely used directly turn documents ostensibly 8859 encoding code positions generally refer instead characters position proprietary systemspecific encoding windows1252 roman codes instead provide additional graphic characters
main article unicode control characters
unicode defines additional control characters including bidirectional text direction override characters used explicitly mark righttoleft writing inside lefttoright writing around variation selectors select alternate forms ideographs emoji characters
