general pipelines classified three categories depending purpose

gathering pipelines
group smaller interconnected pipelines forming complex networks purpose bringing crude natural several nearby wells treatment plant processing facility group pipelines usually short couple hundred metres small diameters subsea pipelines collecting product deep water production platforms also considered gathering systems
transportation pipelines
mainly long pipes large diameters moving products refined products cities countries even continents transportation networks include several compressor stations lines pump stations crude multiproducts pipelines

leak detection systemsedit
since pipelines important asset economic development almost country required either government regulations internal policies ensure safety assets population environment pipelines
pipeline companies face government regulation environmental constraints social situations government regulations define minimum staff operation operator training requirements pipeline facilities technology applications required ensure operational safety example state washington mandatory pipeline operators able detect locate leaks percent maximum flow within fifteen minutes less social factors also affect operation pipelines product theft sometimes also problem pipeline companies case detection levels percent maximum flow high expectation location accuracy
various technologies strategies implemented monitoring pipelines physically walking lines satellite surveillance common technology protect pipelines occasional leaks computational pipeline monitoring takes information field related pressures flows temperatures estimate hydraulic behavior product transported estimation completed results compared field references detect presence anomaly unexpected situation related leak
american petroleum institute published several articles related performance liquids pipelines publications

1130 computational pipeline monitoring liquids pipelines
1149 pipeline variable uncertainties effects leak detectability

pipeline containing passes road railway usually enclosed protective casing casing vented atmosphere prevent buildup flammable gases corrosive substances allow inside casing sampled detect leaks casing vent pipe protruding ground often doubles warning marker called casing vent marker39
implementationedit
pipelines generally laid underground temperature less variable pipelines usually metal helps reduce expansion shrinkage occur weather changes40 however cases necessary cross valley river pipeline bridge pipelines centralized heating systems often laid ground overhead pipelines petroleum running permafrost areas transalaskapipeline often overhead order avoid melting frozen ground petroleum would result sinking pipeline ground
