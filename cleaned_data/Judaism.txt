unlike ancient near eastern gods hebrew portrayed unitary solitary consequently hebrew gods principal relationships gods world specifically people created26page needed judaism thus begins ethical monotheism belief concerned actions mankind27 according tanakh hebrew bible promised abraham make offspring great nation28 many generations later commanded nation israel love worship jewish nation reciprocate gods concern world29 also commanded jewish people love another jews imitate gods love people30 commandments large corpus commandments laws constitute covenant substance judaism
thus although esoteric tradition judaism kabbalah rabbinic scholar kadushin characterized normative judaism normal mysticism involves everyday personal experiences ways modes common jews31 played observance halakha jewish given verbal expression birkat hamizvot short blessings spoken every time positive commandment fulfilled

ordinary familiar everyday things occurrences constitute occasions experience things ones daily sustenance felt manifestations gods lovingkindness calling berakhot kedushah holiness nothing else imitation concerned daily conduct gracious merciful keeping oneself defilement idolatry adultery shedding blood birkat hamitzwot evokes consciousness holiness rabbinic rite objects employed majority rites nonholy general character several holy objects nontheurgic ordinary things occurrences bring experience everything happens evokes experience evil well good berakah said also evil tidings hence although experience like none occasions experiencing consciousness manifold even consider call berakot32

whereas jewish philosophers often debate whether immanent transcendent whether people free lives determined halakha system acts bring world
