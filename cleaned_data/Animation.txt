productionedit
creation nontrivial animation works longer seconds developed form filmmaking certain unique aspects112 traits common liveaction animated featurelength films laborintensity high production costs113
important difference film production phase marginal cost shot higher animated films liveaction films114 relatively easy director take principal photography liveaction film every take animated film must manually rendered animators although task rendering slightly different takes made less tedious modern computer animation115 pointless studio salaries dozens animators spend weeks creating visually dazzling fiveminute scene scene fails effectively advance plot film116 thus animation studios starting disney began practice 1930s maintaining story departments storyboard artists develop every single scene storyboards handing film animators production team satisfied scenes make sense whole liveaction films also storyboarded enjoy latitude depart storyboards realtime improvisation118
another problem unique animation requirement maintain films consistency start finish even films grown longer teams grown larger animators like artists necessarily individual styles must subordinate individuality consistent whatever style employed particular film119 since early 1980s teams people animators typically created featurelength animated films relatively easy three artists match styles synchronizing dozens artists difficult120
problem usually solved separate group visual development artists develop overall look palette film animation begins character designers visual development team draw model sheets show character look like different facial expressions posed different positions viewed different angles121122 traditionally animated projects maquettes often sculpted help animators characters would look different angles36121
unlike liveaction films animated films traditionally developed beyond synopsis stage storyboard format storyboard artists would receive credit writing film123 early 1960s animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters write screenplays also continuing story departments screenplays become commonplace animated films late 1980s
