chemical compound termed inorganic fulfills following criteria

absence carbon composition
nonbiologic origin
cannot found incorporated living organism

clear universally agreedupon distinction organic inorganic compounds organic chemists traditionally generally refer molecule containing carbon organic compound default means inorganic chemistry deals molecules lacking carbon12 many minerals biological origin biologists distinguish organic inorganic compounds different hinge presence carbon atom pools organic matter example metabolically incorporated living tissues persist decomposing tissues molecules become oxidized open environment atmospheric creates separate pool inorganic compounds international union pure applied chemistry iupac agency widely recognized defining chemical terms offer definitions inorganic organic compounds hence definition inorganic versus organic compound multidisciplinary context spans division organic life living animate inorganic nonliving inanimate matter3 broader speech term commonly referred compounds synthesised purely geological systems contrast biological component origin
