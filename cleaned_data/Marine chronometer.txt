marine chronometer jeremy thacker used gimbals vacuum bell


determine position earths surface necessary sufficient know latitude longitude altitude altitude considerations course ignored vessels operating level mid1750s accurate navigation sight land unsolved problem difficulty calculating longitude navigators could determine latitude measuring suns angle noon reached highest point culmination northern hemisphere measure angle polaris north star horizon usually twilight find longitude however needed time standard would work aboard ship observation regular celestial motions galileos method based observing jupiters natural satellites usually possible ships motion lunar distances method initially proposed johannes werner 1514 developed parallel marine chronometer dutch scientist gemma frisius first propose chronometer determine longitude 1530
purpose chronometer measure accurately time known fixed location example greenwich mean time particularly important navigation knowing local noon allows navigator time difference ships position greenwich meridian determine ships longitude earth rotates regular rate time difference chronometer ships local time used calculate longitude ship relative greenwich meridian defined using spherical trigonometry modern practice nautical almanac trigonometric sightreduction tables permit navigators measure moon visible planets selected stars navigation time horizon visible

harrison solved precision problems much smaller chronometer design 1761 looked much like large fiveinch diameter pocket watch 1761 harrison submitted £20000 longitude prize design used fastbeating balance wheel controlled temperaturecompensated spiral spring features remained stable electronic oscillators allowed accurate portable timepieces made affordable cost 1767 board longitude published description work principles harrisons timekeeper9
