navigation
dams create deep reservoirs also vary flow water downstream return affect upstream downstream navigation altering rivers depth deeper water increases creates freedom movement water vessels large dams serve purpose often weirs locks used


purposes conflicting operator needs make dynamic tradeoffs example power generation water supply would keep reservoir high whereas flood prevention would keep many dams areas precipitation fluctuates annual cycle also reservoir fluctuate annually attempt balance difference purposes management becomes complex exercise amongst competing stakeholders59
