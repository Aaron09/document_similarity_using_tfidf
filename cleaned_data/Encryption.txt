publickey encryption schemes encryption published anyone encrypt messages however receiving party access decryption enables messages read2 publickey encryption first described secret document 19733 encryption schemes symmetrickey also called privatekey4478
publicly available public encryption application called pretty good privacy written 1991 phil zimmermann distributed free charge source code purchased symantec 2010 regularly updated5
usesedit
encryption long used militaries governments facilitate secret communication commonly used protecting information within many kinds civilian systems example computer security institute reported 2007 companies surveyed utilized encryption data transit utilized encryption data storage6 encryption used protect data rest information stored computers storage devices flash drives recent years numerous reports confidential data customers personal records exposed loss theft laptops backup drivescitation needed encrypting files rest helps protect physical security measures failcitation needed digital rights management systems prevent unauthorized reproduction copyrighted material protect software reverse engineering also copy protection another somewhat different example using encryption data rest7
response encryption data rest cyberadversaries developed types attacks recent threats encryption data rest include cryptographic attacks8 stolen ciphertext attacks9 attacks encryption keys10 insider attacks data corruption integrity attacks11 data destruction attacks ransomware attacks data fragmentation12 active defense13 data protection technologies attempt counter attacks distributing moving mutating ciphertext difficult identify steal corrupt destroy14
encryption also used protect data transit example data transferred networks internet ecommerce mobile telephones wireless microphones wireless intercom systems bluetooth devices bank automatic teller machines numerous reports data transit intercepted recent years15 data also encrypted transmitted across networks order protect eavesdropping network traffic unauthorized users16
message verificationedit
encryption protect confidentiality messages techniques still needed protect integrity authenticity message example verification message authentication code digital signature standards cryptographic software hardware perform encryption widely available successfully using encryption ensure security challenging problem single error system design execution allow successful attacks sometimes adversary obtain unencrypted information without directly undoing encryption traffic analysis tempest trojan horse17
digital signature encryption must applied ciphertext created typically device used compose message avoid tampering otherwise node sender encryption agent could potentially tamper encrypting time creation secure encryption device tampered
data erasureedit
conventional methods deleting data permanently storage device involve overwriting whole content zeros ones patterns process take significant amount time depending capacity type medium cryptography offers making erasure almost instantaneous method called cryptoshredding example implementation method found devices cryptographic kept dedicated effaceable storage18 stored device setup offer full confidentiality protection case unauthorised person gains physical access device
