summary darwins theoryedit




darwin pictured shortly publication


darwins theory evolution based facts inferences drawn biologist ernst mayr summarised follows5



every species fertile enough offspring survived reproduce population would grow fact
despite periodic fluctuations populations remain roughly size fact
resources food limited relatively stable time fact
struggle survival ensues inference
individuals population vary significantly another fact
much variation heritable fact
individuals less suited environment less likely survive less likely reproduce individuals suited environment likely survive likely reproduce leave heritable traits future generations produces process natural selection fact
slowly effected process results populations changing adapt environments ultimately variations accumulate time form species inference

difficulties theoryedit
chapter begins saying next three chapters address possible objections theory first often intermediate forms closely related species found though theory implies forms must existed darwin noted firstly species descended species insensibly fine gradations everywhere innumerable transitional forms nature confusion instead species well defined136 darwin attributed competition different forms combined small number individuals intermediate forms often leading extinction forms137 difficulty referred absence rarity transitional varieties habitat space
another difficulty related first absence rarity transitional varieties time darwin commented theory natural selection innumerable transitional forms must existed wondered find embedded countless numbers crust earth discussion difficulties speciationdarwins dilemma species exist bernstein al139 michod140
chapter deals whether natural selection could produce complex specialised structures behaviours would difficult imagine intermediate forms could functional darwin said

secondly possible animal instance structure habits could formed modification animal wholly different habits believe natural selection could produce hand organs trifling importance tail giraffe serves flyflapper hand organs wonderful structure hardly fully understand inimitable perfection141

answer many cases animals exist intermediate structures functional presented flying squirrels flying lemurs examples bats might evolved nonflying ancestors142 discussed various simple eyes found invertebrates starting nothing optic nerve coated pigment examples vertebrate could evolved darwin concludes could demonstrated complex organ existed could possibly formed numerous successive slight modifications theory would absolutely break find case143
section organs little apparent importance darwin discusses difficulty explaining various seemingly trivial traits evident adaptive function outlines possibilities correlation useful features accepts profoundly ignorant causes producing slight unimportant variations distinguish domesticated breeds animals144 human races suggests sexual selection might explain variations145146

might adduced purpose differences races strongly marked little light apparently thrown origin differences chiefly sexual selection particular kind without entering copious details reasoning would appear frivolous147

chapter first edition addresses evolution instincts examples included investigated experimentally slavemaking ants construction hexagonal cells honey bees darwin noted species slavemaking ants dependent slaves others observed many species collect store pupae species food thought reasonable species extreme dependency slave workers evolved incremental steps suggested bees make hexagonal cells evolved steps bees made round cells pressure natural selection economise darwin concluded

finally logical deduction imagination satisfactory look instincts young cuckoo ejecting fosterbrothers —ants making slaves —the larvæ ichneumonidæ feeding within live bodies caterpillars —not specially endowed created instincts small consequences general leading advancement organic beings namely multiply vary strongest live weakest die148

chapter viii addresses idea species special characteristics prevented hybrids fertile order preserve separately created species darwin said constant difficulty producing hybrids related species viability fertility hybrids varied greatly especially among plants sometimes widely considered separate species produced fertile hybrid offspring freely cases considered mere varieties species could crossed difficulty darwin concluded finally facts briefly given chapter seem opposed even rather support view fundamental distinction species varieties149
