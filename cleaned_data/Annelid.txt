segments annelid711


annelids body consists segments practically identical sets internal organs external chaetae greek χαιτη meaning hair species appendages however frontmost rearmost sections regarded true segments contain standard sets organs develop true segments frontmost section called prostomium greek meaning front στομα meaning mouth contains brain sense organs rearmost called pygidium greek πυγιδιον meaning little tail periproct contains anus generally underside first section behind prostomium called peristomium greek περι meaning around στομα meaning mouth regarded zoologists true segment polychaetes peristomium chetae appendages like segments7
segments develop time growth zone ahead pygidium annelids youngest segment front growth zone peristomium oldest pattern called teloblastic growth7 groups annelids including leeches14 fixed maximum numbers segments others segments throughout lives11
phylums name derived latin word annelus meaning little ring5

body wall chetae parapodiaedit

annelids cuticles made collagen fibers usually layers spiral alternating directions fibers cross secreted onecell deep epidermis outermost skin layer marine annelids live tubes lack cuticles tubes similar structure mucussecreting glands epidermis protect skins7 epidermis dermis made connective tissue words combination cells noncellular materials collagen layers muscles develop lining coelom body cavity circular muscles make segment longer slimmer contract longitudinal muscles usually four distinct strips17 whose contractions make segment shorter fatter7 annelids also oblique internal muscles connect underside body side17
setae hairs annelids project epidermis provide traction capabilities simplest unjointed form paired bundles near bottom side segment parapodia limbs annelids often bear complex chetae tips example jointed comblike hooked7 chetae made moderately flexible βchitin formed follicles chetoblast hairforming cell bottom muscles extend retract cheta chetoblasts produce chetae forming microvilli fine hairlike extensions increase area available secreting cheta cheta complete microvilli withdraw chetoblast leaving parallel tunnels almost full length cheta7 hence annelids chetae structurally different setae bristles arthropods made rigid αchitin single internal cavity mounted flexible joints shallow pits cuticle7
nearly polychaetes parapodia function limbs major annelid groups lack parapodia unjointed paired extensions body wall muscles derived circular muscles body often supported internally large thick chetae parapodia burrowing tubedwelling polychaetes often ridges whose tips bear hooked chetae active crawlers swimmers parapodia often divided large upper lower paddles short trunk paddles generally fringed chetae sometimes cirri fused bundles cilia gills17

nervous system sensesedit
brain generally forms ring round pharynx throat consisting pair ganglia local control centers front pharynx linked nerve cords either side pharynx another pair ganglia behind brains polychaetes generally prostomium clitellates peristomium sometimes first segment behind peristomium27 mobile active polychaetes brain enlarged complex visible hindbrain midbrain forebrain sections17 rest central nervous system generally ladderlike consisting pair nerve cords bottom part body segment paired ganglia linked transverse connection segmental ganglion branching system local nerves runs body wall encircles body7 however polychaetes main nerve cords fused tubedwelling genus owenia single nerve chord ganglia located epidermis1128
arthropods muscle fiber cell controlled neuron speed power fibers contractions depends combined effects neurons vertebrates different system neuron controls group muscle fibers7 annelids longitudinal nerve trunks include giant axons output signal lines nerve cells large diameter decreases resistance allows transmit signals exceptionally fast enables worms withdraw rapidly danger shortening bodies experiments shown cutting giant axons prevents escape response affect normal movement7

peristalsis moves worm right


many annelids move peristalsis waves contraction expansion sweep along body7 flex body using parapodia crawl swim30 animals septa enable circular longitudinal muscles change shape individual segments making segment separate fluidfilled balloon7 however septa often incomplete annelids semisessile move peristalsis movements parapodia example move whipping movements body small marine species move means cilia fine musclepowered hairs burrowers turn pharynges throats inside penetrate seafloor drag
fluid coelomata contains coelomocyte cells defend animals parasites infections species coelomocytes also contain respiratory pigment hemoglobin species green chlorocruorin others dissolved plasma17 provide oxygen transport within segments respiratory pigment also dissolved blood plasma species welldeveloped septa generally also blood vessels running long bodies upper carrying blood forwards lower carries backwards networks capillaries body wall around transfer blood main blood vessels parts segment need oxygen nutrients major vessels especially upper pump blood contracting annelids forward upper blood vessel enlarged muscles form heart forward ends many earthworms vessels connect upper lower main vessels function hearts species poorly developed septa generally blood vessels rely circulation within coelom delivering nutrients oxygen7
however leeches closest relatives body structure uniform within group significantly different annelids including members clitellata14 leeches septa connective tissue layer body wall thick occupies much body coelomata widely separated length body function main blood vessels although sidebyside rather upper lower however lined mesothelium like coelomata unlike blood vessels annelids leeches generally suckers front rear ends move like inchworms anus upper surface pygidium14

however lifecycles living polychaetes almost marine animals unknown species whose lifecycles known follow pattern similar external fertilization produce yolkrich eggs reduce time larva needs spend among plankton eggs miniature adults emerge rather larvae rest care fertilized eggs hatch producing jellycovered masses eggs tend attaching eggs bodies species keeping eggs within bodies hatch species variety methods sperm transfer example females collect sperm released water others males penis inject sperm female37 guarantee representative sample polychaetes reproductive patterns simply reflects scientists current knowledge37
polychaetes breed lives others breed almost continuously several breeding seasons polychaetes remain lives significant percentage species full hermaphrodites change lives polychaetes whose reproduction studied lack permanent gonads uncertain produce sperm species rear body splits becomes separate individual lives long enough swim suitable environment usually near surface spawn37
mature clitellates group includes earthworms leeches full hermaphrodites although leech species younger adults function males become female maturity welldeveloped gonads copulate earthworms store partners sperm spermathecae sperm stores clitellum produces cocoon collects ovaries sperm spermathecae fertilization development earthworm eggs takes place cocoon leeches eggs fertilized ovaries transferred cocoon clitellates cocoon also either produces yolk eggs fertilized nutrients developing clitellates hatch miniature adults rather larvae37

traditionally annelids divided major groups polychaetes clitellates turn clitellates divided oligochaetes include earthworms hirudinomorphs whose bestknown members leeches7 many years clear arrangement approximately polychaete families higherlevel groups9 1997 greg rouse kristian fauchald attempted first heuristic step terms bringing polychaete systematics acceptable level rigour based anatomical structures divided polychaetes into56

scolecida less 1000 burrowing species look rather like earthworms57
