introductionedit
kegg database project initiated 1995 minoru kanehisa professor institute chemical research kyoto university ongoing japanese human genome program12 foreseeing need computerized resource used biological interpretation genome sequence data started developing kegg pathway database collection manually drawn kegg pathway maps representing experimental knowledge metabolism various functions cell organism pathway contains network molecular interactions reactions designed link genes genome gene products mostly proteins pathway enabled analysis called kegg pathway mapping whereby gene content genome compared kegg pathway database examine pathways associated functions likely encoded genome
according developers kegg computer representation biological system3 integrates building blocks wiring diagrams system specifically genetic building blocks genes proteins chemical building blocks small molecules reactions wiring diagrams molecular interaction reaction networks concept realized following databases kegg categorized systems genomic chemical health information4

metabolism section contains aesthetically drawn global maps showing overall picture metabolism addition regular metabolic pathway maps lowresolution global maps used example compare metabolic capacities different organisms genomics studies different environmental samples metagenomics studies contrast kegg modules kegg module database higherresolution localized wiring diagrams representing tighter functional units within pathway subpathways conserved among specific organism groups molecular complexes kegg modules defined characteristic gene sets linked specific metabolic capacities phenotypic features used automatic interpretation genome metagenome data
another database supplements kegg pathway kegg brite database ontology database containing hierarchical classifications various entities including genes proteins organisms diseases drugs chemical compounds kegg pathway limited molecular interactions reactions entities kegg brite incorporates many different types relationships
genomic informationedit
several months kegg project initiated 1995 first report completely sequenced bacterial genome published5 since published complete genomes accumulated kegg eukaryotes prokaryotes kegg genes database contains geneproteinlevel information kegg genome database contains organismlevel information genomes kegg genes database consists gene sets complete genomes genes given annotations form establishing correspondences wiring diagrams kegg pathway maps kegg modules brite hierarchies
correspondences made using concept orthologs kegg pathway maps drawn based experimental evidence specific organisms designed applicable organisms well different organisms human mouse often share identical pathways consisting functionally identical genes called orthologous genes orthologs genes kegg genes database grouped orthologs kegg orthology database nodes gene products kegg pathway maps well kegg modules brite hierarchies given identifiers correspondences established genes genome annotated identifiers genome annotation procedure kegg4
chemical informationedit
kegg metabolic pathway maps drawn represent dual aspects metabolic network genomic network genomeencoded enzymes connected catalyze consecutive reactions chemical network chemical structures substrates products transformed reactions6 enzyme genes genome identify enzyme relation networks superimposed kegg pathway maps turn characterize chemical structure transformation networks allowing interpretation biosynthetic biodegradation potentials organism alternatively metabolites identified metabolome lead understanding enzymatic pathways enzyme genes involved
databases chemical information category collectively called kegg ligand organized capturing knowledge chemical network beginning kegg project kegg ligand consisted three databases kegg compound chemical compounds kegg reaction chemical reactions kegg enzyme reactions enzyme nomenclature7 currently additional databases kegg glycan glycans8 auxiliary reaction databases called rpair reactant pair alignments rclass reaction class9 kegg compound also expanded contain various compounds xenobiotics addition metabolites
health informationedit
kegg diseases viewed perturbed states biological system caused perturbants genetic factors environmental factors drugs viewed different types perturbants10 kegg pathway database includes normal states also perturbed states biological systems however disease pathway maps cannot drawn diseases molecular mechanisms well understood alternative approach taken kegg disease database simply catalogs known genetic factors environmental factors diseases catalogs eventually lead complete wiring diagrams diseases
kegg drug database contains active ingredients approved drugs japan europe distinguished chemical structures andor chemical components associated target molecules metabolizing enzymes molecular interaction network information kegg pathway maps brite hierarchies enables integrated analysis drug interactions genomic information crude drugs healthrelated substances outside category approved drugs stored kegg environ database databases health information category collectively called kegg medicus also includes package inserts marketed drugs japan
