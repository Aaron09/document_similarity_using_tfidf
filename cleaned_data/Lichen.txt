lichens pioneer species among first living things grow bare rock areas denuded life disaster2 lichens compete plants access sunlight small size slow growth thrive places higher plants difficulty growing lichens often first settle places lacking soil constituting sole vegetation extreme environments found high mountain elevations high latitudes100 survive tough conditions deserts others frozen soil arctic regions101
major ecophysiological advantage lichens poikilohydric poikilo variable hydric relating water meaning though little control status hydration tolerate irregular extended periods severe desiccation like mosses liverworts ferns resurrection plants upon desiccation lichens enter metabolic suspension stasis known cryptobiosis cells lichen symbionts dehydrated degree halts biochemical activity cryptobiotic state lichens survive wider extremes temperature radiation drought harsh environments often inhabit




lichens suppress growth mosses higher plants around


lichens roots need continuous reservoirs water like higher plants thus grow locations impossible plants bare rock sterile soil sand various artificial structures walls roofs monuments many lichens also grow epiphytes surface phyte plant plants particularly trunks branches trees growing plants lichens parasites consume part plant poison lichens produce allelopathic chemicals inhibit growth mosses grounddwelling lichens members subgenus cladina reindeer lichens produce allelopathic chemicals leach soil inhibit germination seeds spruce plants102 stability longevity substrate major factor lichen habitats lichens grow stable rock surfaces bark trees many others grow soil sand latter cases lichens often important part soil stabilization indeed desert ecosystems vascular higher plant seeds cannot become established except places lichen crusts stabilize sand help retain water
lichens eaten animals reindeer living arctic regions larvae number lepidoptera species feed exclusively lichens include common footman marbled beauty however lichens protein high carbohydrates making unsuitable animals lichens also used northern flying squirrel nesting food water source winter
effects pollutionedit




lichens like foliose lobaria pulmonaria sensitive pollution


lichens exposed pollutants times without deciduous parts unable avoid accumulation pollutants also lacking stomata cuticle lichens absorb aerosols gases entire thallus surface readily diffuse photobiont layer103 lichens possess roots primary source elements therefore elemental levels lichens often reflect accumulated composition ambient processes atmospheric deposition occurs include gaseous absorption deposition104 consequently many environmental studies lichens emphasize feasibility effective biomonitors atmospheric quality103105106107108
lichens equally sensitive pollutants different lichen species show different levels sensitivity specific atmospheric pollutants109 sensitivity lichen pollution directly related energy needs mycobiont stronger dependency mycobiont photobiont sensitive lichen pollution110 upon exposure pollution photobiont metabolic energy repair cellular structures would otherwise used maintenance photosynthetic activity therefore leaving less metabolic energy available mycobiont alteration balance photobiont mycobiont lead breakdown symbiotic association therefore lichen decline result accumulation toxic substances also altered nutrient supplies favor symbiont other103

lichenometryedit
main article lichenometry
lichenometry technique used determine exposed rock surfaces based size lichen thalli introduced beschel 1950s112 technique found many applications used archaeology palaeontology geomorphology uses presumed regular slow rate lichen growth determine exposed rock109113 measuring diameter size measurement largest lichen species rock surface indicates length time since rock surface first exposed lichen preserved rock faces tocitation needed 10000 years providing maximum limit technique though accurate within error applied surfaces exposed less 1000 years114 lichenometry especially useful dating surfaces less years radiocarbon dating techniques less accurate period115 lichens commonly used lichenometry genera rhizocarpon species rhizocarpon geographicum xanthoria
biodegradationedit
lichens shown degrade polyester resins seen archaeological sites roman city baelo claudia spain116 lichens accumulate several environmental pollutants lead copper radionuclides9
dyesedit
many lichens produce secondary compounds including pigments reduce harmful amounts sunlight powerful toxins reduce herbivory kill bacteria compounds useful lichen identification economic importance dyes cudbear primitive antibiotics

lichenes fancifully drawn ernst haeckel emphasize ideas symmetry artforms nature 1904


although lichens recognized organisms quite time 1867 swiss botanist simon schwendener proposed dual theory lichens lichens combination fungi algae cyanobacteria whereby true nature lichen association began emerge124 schwendeners hypothesis time lacked experimental evidence arose extensive analysis anatomy development lichens algae fungi using light microscope many leading lichenologists time james crombie nylander rejected schwendeners hypothesis common consensus living organisms autonomous124
prominent biologists heinrich anton bary albert bernhard frank melchior treub hermann hellriegel quick reject schwendeners ideas concept soon spread areas study microbial plant animal human pathogens124125 complex relationships pathogenic microorganisms hosts finally identified schwendeners hypothesis began gain popularity experimental proof dual nature lichens obtained eugen thomas published results 1939 first successful resynthesis experiment124
2010s facet fungialgae partnership discovered toby spribille colleagues found many types lichen long thought ascomycetealgae pairs actually ascomycetebasidiomycetealgae trios1126
