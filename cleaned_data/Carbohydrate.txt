terminologyedit
scientific literature term carbohydrate many synonyms like sugar broad sense saccharide ose7 glucide10 hydrate carbon polyhydroxy compounds aldehyde ketone4 terms specially carbohydrate sugar also used meanings
food science many informal contexts term carbohydrate often means food particularly rich complex carbohydrate starch cereals bread pasta simple carbohydrates sugar found candy jams desserts
often lists nutritional information usda national nutrient database term carbohydrate carbohydrate difference used everything water protein ethanol11 include chemical compounds acetic lactic acid normally considered carbohydrates also includes dietary fiber carbohydrate contribute much food energy calories even though often included calculation total food energy though sugar
strict sense sugar applied sweet soluble carbohydrates many used food

natural saccharides generally built simple carbohydrates called monosaccharides general formula ch2on three typical monosaccharide structure h–chohxco–chohy–h aldehyde ketone many hydroxyl groups added usually carbon atom part aldehyde ketone functional group examples monosaccharides glucose fructose glyceraldehydes however biological substances commonly called monosaccharides conform formula uronic acids deoxysugars fucose many chemicals conform formula considered monosaccharides formaldehyde ch2o inositol ch2o614
openchain form monosaccharide often coexists closed ring form aldehydeketone carbonyl group carbon hydroxyl group react forming hemiacetal c–o–c bridge
monosaccharides linked together called polysaccharides oligosaccharides large variety ways many carbohydrates contain modified monosaccharide units groups replaced removed example deoxyribose component modified version ribose chitin composed repeating units nacetyl glucosamine nitrogencontaining form glucose
