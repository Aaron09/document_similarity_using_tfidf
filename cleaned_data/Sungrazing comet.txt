representative orbit sungrazing comet


sungrazing comet comet passes extremely close perihelion sometimes within thousand kilometres suns surface although small sungrazers completely evaporate close approach larger sungrazers survive many perihelion passages however strong evaporation tidal forces experience often lead fragmentation
1880s thought bright comets near repeated return single sungrazing comet german astronomer heinrich kreutz american astronomer daniel kirkwood determined instead return comet appearance different comet related group comets separated earlier passage near perihelion1 little known population sungrazing comets 1979 coronagraphic observations allowed detection sungrazers october 2017 1495 known comets come within solar radii 0055 accounts nearly third comets3 objects vaporize close approach comet nucleus radius larger likely survive perihelion passage final radius
sungrazer comets earliest observed comets appear bright even considered great comets close passage comet brighten comet reflection comet nucleus closer also vaporizes large amount comet reflects light extreme brightening allow possible naked observations earth depending volatile gases comet large enough survive perihelion comets provide useful tool understanding composition comets observe outgassing activity also offer probe effects solar radiation solar system bodies

history sungrazersedit
pre19th centuryedit
first comets orbit computed sungrazing comet great comet 1680 designated c1680 observed isaac newton published orbit results 16874 later 1699 jacques cassini proposed comets could relatively short orbital periods c1680 comet observed tycho brahe 1577 1705 edmond halley determined difference perihelion distances comets great object56 however marked first time hypothesized great comets related perhaps comet later johann franz encke computed orbit c1680 found period near 9000 years concluded cassinis theory short period sungrazers flawed c1680 smallest measured perihelion distance 1826 comet c1826
19th centuryedit
advances made understanding sungrazing comets 19th century great comets 1843 c1880 1882 c1880 c1843 similar appearances also resembled great comet 1106 therefore daniel kirkwood proposed c1880 c1843 separate fragments object1 also hypothesized parent body comet seen aristotle ephorus supposed claim ephorus witnessed comet splitting perihelion4
comet c1882 appeared years previously observed sungrazer convinced astronomers bright comets object astronomers theorized comet might pass resisting medium near would shorten period4 astronomers observed c1882 measured period perihelion shortening period disproved theory perihelion object also seen split several fragments therefore kirkwoods theory comets coming parent body seemed like good explanation
attempt link 1843 1880 comets comet 1106 kreutz measured fragments 1882 comet determined likely fragment 1106 comet designated sungrazing comets similar orbital characteristics comets would part kreutz group4
19th century also provided first spectrum taken comet near taken finlay elkin 18827 later spectrum analyzed spectral lines confirmed8
20th centuryedit
first sungrazing comet observed 20th century 1945 1960 1970 five sungrazing comets seen c1961 c1962 c1963 c1965 c1970 1965 comet comet ikeyaseki allowed measurements spectral emission lines several elements detected including iron marking first comet since great comet 1882 show feature emission lines included v910111213 comet ikeyaseki also separating kreutz sungrazers subgroups brian marsden 196714 subgroup appears 1106 comet parent body members fragments comet group similar dynamics confirmed parent body associated
coronagraphic observationsedit
20th century greatly impacted sungrazing comet research launch coronagraphic telescopes including solwind soho point sungrazing comets seen naked coronagraphic telescopes many sungrazers observed much smaller survived perihelion passage comets observed solwind 1981 1989 visual magnitudes much fainter comet ikeyaseki visual magnitude
1987 1988 first observed could pairs sungrazing comets appear within short time periods ranging half weeks calculations made determine pairs part parent body broke apart tens sun15 breakup velocities order meters second comparable speed rotation comets conclusion comets break tidal forces comets c1882 c1965 c1963 probably broke great comet 110616
coronagraphs allowed measuring properties comet reached close noted sungrazing comets tend peak brightness distance solar radii solar radii thought variation stems difference dust composition another small peak brightness found solar radii possibly fragmentation comet nucleus4 alternative explanation brightness peak solar radii comes sublimation amorphous olivines peak solar radii sublimation crystalline olivines peak solar radii could sublimation pyroxene17
