etymologyedit
word vacuum comes latin meaning empty space void noun neuter vacuus meaning empty related vacare meaning empty
vacuum words english language contains consecutive letters
historical interpretationedit
historically much dispute whether thing vacuum exist ancient greek philosophers debated existence vacuum void context atomism posited void atom fundamental explanatory elements physics following plato even abstract concept featureless void faced considerable skepticism could apprehended senses could provide additional explanatory power beyond physical volume commensurate definition quite literally nothing cannot rightly said exist aristotle believed void could occur naturally denser surrounding material continuum would immediately fill incipient rarity might give rise void
physics book aristotle offered numerous arguments void example motion medium offered impediment could continue infinitum reason something would come rest anywhere particular although lucretius argued existence vacuum first century hero alexandria tried unsuccessfully create artificial vacuum first century european scholars roger bacon blasius parma walter burley 13th 14th century focused considerable attention issues eventually following stoic physics instance scholars 14th century onward increasingly departed aristotelian perspective favor supernatural void beyond confines cosmos conclusion widely acknowledged 17th century helped segregate natural theological concerns9
almost thousand years plato rené descartes also proposed geometrically based alternative theory atomism without problematic nothing–everything dichotomy void atom although descartes agreed contemporary position vacuum occur nature success namesake coordinate system implicitly spatial–corporeal component metaphysics would come define philosophically modern notion empty space quantified extension volume ancient definition however directional information magnitude conceptually distinct acquiescence cartesian mechanical philosophy brute fact action distance length successful reification force fields ever sophisticated geometric structure anachronism empty space widened seething ferment10 quantum activity 20th century filled vacuum virtual pleroma

medieval thought experiments idea vacuum considered whether vacuum present instant flat plates rapidly separated19 much discussion whether moved quickly enough plates separated walter burley postulated whether celestial agent prevented vacuum arising commonly held view nature abhorred vacuum called horror vacui speculation even could create vacuum wanted shut downclarification needed 1277 paris condemnations bishop etienne tempier required restrictions powers conclusion could create vacuum wished20 jean buridan reported 14th century teams horses could pull open bellows port sealed8
