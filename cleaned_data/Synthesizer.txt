synthesizer often abbreviated synth also spelled synthesiser electronic musical instrument generates electric signals converted sound instrument amplifiers loudspeakers headphones synthesizers either imitate traditional musical instruments like piano hammond organ flute vocals natural sounds like ocean waves generate novel electronic timbres often played musical keyboard controlled variety input devices including music sequencers instrument controllers fingerboards guitar synthesizers wind controllers electronic drums synthesizers without builtin controllers often called sound modules controlled midi cvgate using controller device often midi keyboard controller
synthesizers various methods generate electronic signals sounds among popular waveform synthesis techniques subtractive synthesis additive synthesis wavetable synthesis frequency modulation synthesis phase distortion synthesis physical modeling synthesis samplebased synthesis
synthesizers first used music 1960s late 1970s synths used disco 1980s invention relatively inexpensive yamaha synth made digital synthesizers widely available 1980s dance music often made heavy synthesizers 2010s synthesizers used many genres rock dance music contemporary classical music composers 20th 21st century write compositions synthesizer
