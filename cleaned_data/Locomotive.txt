advantagesedit
basic reasons isolate locomotive train power compared selfpropelled vehicles57

ease
whether necessity replace locomotive failure reason needing maintain power unit relatively easy replace locomotive another removing entire train service
maximum utilization power cars
separate locomotives facilitate movement costly motive power assets needed thereby avoiding expense associated tied idle power resources
flexibility
large locomotives substitute small locomotives power required example grades steeper needed locomotive used either freight duties passenger service
obsolescence cycles
separating motive power payloadhauling cars enables replacement without affecting illustrate locomotives might become obsolete associated cars vice versa
safety
accident locomotive buffer zone rest train depending obstacle encountered rail line heavier mass locomotive less likely deviate normal course event fire might safer example diesel locomotives
noise
single source tractive power motors place quieter multiple operational power units motors located every carriage noise problem particularly noticeable diesel multiple units
saves time
motive power accompanies cars hauled consequently saving time
maintenance
especially steam locomotives also types maintenance facilities dirty environments advantageous take passenger accommodation depot reason demise steam railmotors

disadvantagesedit
several advantages multiple unit trains compared locomotives

energy efficiency
multiple units energy efficient locomotivehauled trains nimble especially grades much trains weight sometimes placed driven wheels rather suffering dead weight unpowered coaches
need turn locomotive
many multiple units cabs ends therefore train reversed without uncouplingrecoupling locomotive providing quicker turnaround times reduced crew costs enhanced safety practice development driving trailers cars removed need locomotives runaround giving easy bidirectional operation removing advantage
reliability
multiple unit trains multiple engines failure engine usually prevent train continuing journey locomotive drawn passenger train typically single power unit failure single unit temporarily disables train however often case locomotive hauled freight trains passenger trains utilize multiple locomotives thus able continue reduced speed failure locomotive
