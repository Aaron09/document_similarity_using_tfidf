comparison renewable energy
also renewable energy debate nuclear power proposed renewable energy renewable energy cost electricity source
ongoing debate relative benefits nuclear power compared renewable energy sources generation lowcarbon electricity proponents renewable energy argue wind power solar power already cheaper safer nuclear power nuclear power proponents argue renewable energy sources wind solar offer scalability necessary large scale decarbonization electric grid mainly intermittency284285 although majority installed renewable energy across world currently form hydro power solar wind power growing much higher pace especially developed countries
several studies report principle possible cover energy generation renewable sources intergovernmental panel climate change ipcc said governments supportive full complement renewable energy technologies deployed renewable energy supply could account almost worlds energy within forty years286 rajendra pachauri chairman ipcc said necessary investment renewables would cost global annually approach could contain greenhouse levels less parts million safe level beyond climate change becomes catastrophic irreversible286
however studies suggest solar wind energy costeffective compared nuclear power brookings institution published benefits nocarbon electricity technologies 2014 states performing energy emissions cost analysis benefits nuclear hydro natural combined cycle plants outweigh benefits wind solar plants cost effective carbon power technology determined nuclear power287288289
