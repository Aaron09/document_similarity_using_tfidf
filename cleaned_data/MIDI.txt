example music created midi format






midi allows multiple instruments played single controller often keyboard pictured makes stage setups much portable system fits single rack case prior advent midi would required four separate fullsize keyboard instruments plus outboard mixing effects units


midi ˈmɪdi short musical instrument digital interface technical standard describes communications protocol digital interface electrical connectors allows wide variety electronic musical instruments computers related music audio devices connect communicate another1 single midi link carry sixteen channels information routed separate device
midi carries event messages specify notation pitch velocity loudness softness control signals parameters volume vibrato audio panning left right cues theatre clock signals synchronize tempo multiple devices messages sent midi cable devices control sound generation features simple example midi setup midi controller electronic musical keyboard trigger sounds created sound module turn plugged keyboard amplifier midi data also recorded hardware software device called sequencer used edit data play back later time24
