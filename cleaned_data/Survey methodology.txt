single survey made least sample full population case census method data collection questionnaire individual questions items become data analyzed statistically single survey focus different types topics preferences presidential candidate opinions abortion legal behavior smoking alcohol factual information income depending purpose since survey research almost always based sample population success research dependent representativeness sample respect target population interest researcher target population range general population given country specific groups people within country membership list professional organization list students enrolled school system also sampling statistics survey sampling persons replying survey called respondents depending questions asked answers represent individuals households employers organization represent
survey methodology scientific field seeks identify principles sample design data collection instruments statistical adjustment data data processing final data analysis create systematic random survey errors survey errors sometimes analyzed connection survey cost cost constraints sometimes framed improving quality within cost constraints alternatively reducing costs fixed level quality survey methodology scientific field profession meaning professionals field focus survey errors empirically others design surveys reduce survey designers task involves making large decisions thousands individual features survey order improve
important methodological challenges survey methodologist include making decisions

identify select potential sample members
contact sampled individuals collect data hard reach reluctant respond
evaluate test questions
select mode posing questions collecting responses
train supervise interviewers involved
check data files accuracy internal consistency
adjust survey estimates correct identified errors

selecting samplesedit
main article survey sampling
sample chosen sampling frame consists list members population interest4 goal survey describe sample larger population generalizing ability dependent representativeness sample stated member population termed element frequent difficulties encounters choosing representative sample common error results selection bias selection bias results procedures used select sample result representation representation significant aspect population instance population interest consists females males sample consists females males females represented males overrepresented order minimize selection biases stratified random sampling often used population divided subpopulations called strata random samples drawn strata elements drawn sample proportional basis
modes data collectionedit
main article survey data collection
several ways administering survey choice administration modes influenced several factors including

costs
coverage target population
flexibility asking questions
respondents willingness participate
response accuracy

different methods create mode effects change respondents answer different methods different advantages common modes administration summarized

telephone
mail post
online surveys
personal inhome surveys
personal mall street intercept survey

research designsedit
several different designs overall structures used survey research three general types crosssectional successive independent samples longitudinal studies4
crosssectional studiesedit
crosssectional studies sample samples drawn relevant population studied once4 crosssectional study describes characteristics population time cannot give insight causes population characteristics predictive correlational design
successive independent samples studiesedit
successive independent samples design draws multiple random samples population times4 design study changes within population changes within individuals individuals surveyed studies cannot therefore identify causes change time necessarily successive independent samples designs effective samples must drawn population must equally representative samples comparable changes samples demographic characteristics rather time addition questions must asked responses compared directly
longitudinal studiesedit
longitudinal studies take measure random sample multiple time points4 unlike successive independent samples design design measures differences individual participants’ responses time means researcher potentially assess reasons response changes assessing differences respondents’ experiences longitudinal studies easiest assess effect naturally occurring event divorce cannot tested experimentally however longitudinal studies expensive difficult it’s harder find sample commit months yearslong study 15minute interview participants frequently leave study final assessment attrition participants random samples become less representative successive assessments account researcher compare respondents left survey statistically different populations respondents also selfconsistent spite changes survey answers
questionnairesedit
questionnaires commonly used tool survey research however results particular survey worthless questionnaire written inadequately4 questionnaires produce valid reliable demographic variable measures yield valid reliable individual disparities selfreport scales generate4
questionnaires toolsedit
variable category often measured survey research demographic variables used depict characteristics people surveyed sample4 demographic variables include measures ethnicity socioeconomic status race age4 surveys often assess preferences attitudes individuals many employ selfreport scales measure people’s opinions judgements different items presented scale4 selfreport scales also used examine disparities among people scale items4 selfreport scales usually presented questionnaire form used instruments psychology thus important measures constructed carefully also reliable valid4
reliability validity selfreport measuresedit
reliable measures selfreport defined consistency4 thus reliable selfreport measure produces consistent results every time executed4 test’s reliability measured ways4 first calculate testretest reliability4 testretest reliability entails conducting questionnaire large sample different times4 questionnaire considered reliable people sample score identically test rather position score distribution similar test retest4 selfreport measures generally reliable many items measuring construct4 furthermore measurements reliable factor measured greater variability among individuals sample tested4 finally greater reliability instructions completion questionnaire clear limited distractions testing environment4 contrastingly questionnaire valid measures originally planned measure4 construct validity measure degree measures theoretical construct originally supposed measure4
important note evidence suggest selfreport measures tend less accurate reliable alternative methods assessing data observational studies example
composing questionnaireedit
steps employed construct questionnaire produce reliable valid results4 first must decide kind information collected4 second must decide conduct questionnaire4 thirdly must construct first draft questionnaire4 fourth questionnaire revised4 next questionnaire pretested4 finally questionnaire edited procedures specified4
guidelines effective wording questionsedit
question phrased large impact research participant answer question4 thus survey researchers must conscious wording writing survey questions4 important researchers keep mind different individuals cultures subcultures interpret certain words phrases differently another4 different types questions survey researchers writing questionnaire free response questions closed questions4 free response questions openended whereas closed questions usually multiple choice4 free response questions beneficial allow responder greater flexibility also difficult record score requiring extensive coding4 contrastingly closed questions scored coded much easier diminish expressivity spontaneity responder4 general vocabulary questions simple direct less twenty words4 question edited readability avoid leading loaded questions4 finally multiple items used measure construct wording items worded opposite direction evade response bias4
respondents answer openended question coded response scale afterwards5 analysed using qualitative methods
order questionsedit
survey researchers carefully construct order questions questionnaire4 questionnaires selfadministered interesting questions beginning questionnaire catch respondent’s attention demographic questions near end4 contrastingly survey administered telephone person demographic questions administered beginning interview boost respondent’s confidence4 another reason mindful question order cause survey response effect question affect people respond subsequent questions result priming
nonresponse reductionedit
following ways recommended reducing nonresponse7 telephone facetoface surveys8

advance letter short letter sent advance inform sampled respondents upcoming survey style letter personalized overdone first announces phone call made interviewer wants make appointment survey facetoface second research topic described last allows expression surveyors appreciation cooperation opening questions survey
training interviewers thoroughly trained respondents questions work computers making schedules callbacks respondents reached
short introduction interviewer always start short introduction shehe give name institute working length interview goal interview also useful make clear selling anything shown lead slightly higher responding rate9
respondentfriendly survey questionnaire questions asked must clear nonoffensive easy respond subjects study

brevity also often cited increasing response rate 1996 literature review found mixed evidence support claim written verbal surveys concluding factors often important10 2010 study looking 100000 online surveys found response rate dropped questions questions dropoff slowing example reduction questions11 studies showed quality response degraded toward long surveys12
interviewer effectsedit
survey methodologists devoted much effort determining extent interviewee responses affected physical characteristics interviewer main interviewer traits demonstrated influence survey responses race13 gender14 relative body weight bmi15 interviewer effects particularly operant questions related interviewer trait hence race interviewer shown affect responses measures regarding racial attitudes16 interviewer responses questions involving gender issues17 interviewer answers eating dietingrelated questions18 interviewer effects investigated mainly facetoface surveys also shown exist interview modes visual contact telephone surveys videoenhanced surveys explanation typically provided interviewer effects social desirability bias survey participants attempt project positive selfimage effort conform norms attribute interviewer asking questions interviewer effects example survey response effects
