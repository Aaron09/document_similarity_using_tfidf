ecosystem processesedit
energy carbon enter ecosystems photosynthesis incorporated living tissue transferred organisms feed living dead plant matter eventually released respiration14 mineral nutrients hand recycled within ecosystems15
ecosystems controlled external internal factors external factors also called state factors control overall structure ecosystem things work within influenced ecosystem important climate8 climate determines biome ecosystem embedded rainfall patterns temperature seasonality determine amount water available ecosystem supply energy available influencing photosynthesis8 parent material underlying geological material gives rise soils determines nature soils present influences supply mineral nutrients topography also controls ecosystem processes affecting things like microclimate soil development movement water system difference ecosystem present wetland situated small depression landscape present adjacent steep hillside8
external factors play important role ecosystem functioning include time potential biota ecosystems dynamic entities—invariably subject periodic disturbances process recovering past disturbance9 time plays role development soil bare rock recovery community disturbance8 similarly organisms potentially present area also major impact ecosystems ecosystems similar environments located different parts world things differently simply different pools species present8 introduction nonnative species cause substantial shifts ecosystem function

main article energy flow ecology
also food trophic level
carbon energy incorporated plant tissues primary production either consumed animals plant alive remains uneaten plant tissue dies becomes detritus terrestrial ecosystems roughly ends broken decomposers remainder either consumed animals still alive enters plantbased trophic system consumed died enters detritusbased trophic system aquatic systems proportion plant biomass gets consumed herbivores much higher18 trophic systems photosynthetic organisms primary producers organisms consume tissues called primary consumers secondary producers—herbivores organisms feed microbes bacteria fungi termed microbivores animals feed primary consumers—carnivores—are secondary consumers constitutes trophic level18 sequence consumption—from plant herbivore carnivore—forms food chain real systems much complex this—organisms generally feed form food feed trophic level carnivores capture prey part plantbased trophic system others part detritusbased trophic system bird feeds herbivorous grasshoppers earthworms consume detritus real systems complexities form food webs rather food chains18
decompositionedit
also decomposition
carbon nutrients dead organic matter broken group processes known decomposition releases nutrients reused plant microbial production returns carbon dioxide atmosphere water used photosynthesis absence decomposition dead organic matter would accumulate ecosystem nutrients atmospheric carbon dioxide would depleted19 approximately terrestrial goes directly plant decomposer18
decomposition processes separated three categories—leaching fragmentation chemical alteration dead material water moves dead organic matter dissolves carries watersoluble components taken organisms soil react mineral soil transported beyond confines ecosystem considered lost it19 newly shed leaves newly dead animals high concentrations watersoluble components include sugars amino acids mineral nutrients leaching important environments much less important ones19
fragmentation processes break organic material smaller pieces exposing surfaces colonization microbes freshly shed leaf litter inaccessible outer layer cuticle bark cell contents protected cell wall newly dead animals covered exoskeleton fragmentation processes break protective layers accelerate rate microbial decomposition19 animals fragment detritus hunt food passage freezethaw cycles cycles wetting drying also fragment dead material19
chemical alteration dead organic matter primarily achieved bacterial fungal action fungal hyphae produce enzymes break tough outer structures surrounding dead plant material also produce enzymes break lignin allows access cell contents nitrogen lignin fungi transfer carbon nitrogen hyphal networks thus unlike bacteria dependent solely locally available resources19
decomposition rates vary among ecosystems rate decomposition governed three sets factors—the physical environment temperature moisture soil properties quantity quality dead material available decomposers nature microbial community itself20 temperature controls rate microbial respiration higher temperature faster microbial decomposition occurs also affects soil moisture slows microbial growth reduces leaching freezethaw cycles also affect decomposition—freezing temperatures kill soil microorganisms allows leaching play important role moving nutrients around especially important soil thaws spring creating pulse nutrients become available20
decomposition rates conditions decomposition rates highest moist conditions adequate levels oxygen soils tend become deficient oxygen especially true wetlands slows microbial growth soils decomposition slows well bacteria continue grow albeit slower rate even soils become support plant growth rains return soils become osmotic gradient bacterial cells soil water causes cells gain water quickly conditions many bacterial cells burst releasing pulse nutrients20 decomposition rates also tend slower acidic soils20 soils rich clay minerals tend lower decomposition rates thus higher levels organic matter20 smaller particles clay result larger surface area hold water higher water content soil lower oxygen content21 consequently lower rate decomposition clay minerals also bind particles organic material surface making less accessibly microbes20 soil disturbance like tilling increase decomposition increasing amount oxygen soil exposing organic matter soil microbes20
quality quantity material available decomposers another major factor influences rate decomposition substances like sugars amino acids decompose readily considered labile cellulose hemicellulose broken slowly moderately labile compounds resistant decay like lignin cutin considered recalcitrant20 litter higher proportion labile compounds decomposes much rapidly litter higher proportion recalcitrant material consequently dead animals decompose rapidly dead leaves decompose rapidly fallen branches20 organic material soil ages quality decreases labile compounds decompose quickly leaving increasing proportion recalcitrant material microbial cell walls also contain recalcitrant materials like chitin also accumulate microbes reducing quality older soil organic matter20
nutrient cyclingedit
also nutrient cycle biogeochemical cycle nitrogen cycle




biological nitrogen cycling


ecosystems continually exchange energy carbon wider environment mineral nutrients hand mostly cycled back forth plants animals microbes soil nitrogen enters ecosystems biological nitrogen fixation deposited precipitation dust gases applied fertilizer15 since terrestrial ecosystems nitrogenlimited nitrogen cycling important control ecosystem production15
modern times nitrogen fixation major source nitrogen ecosystems nitrogen fixing bacteria either live symbiotically plants live freely soil energetic cost high plants support nitrogenfixing symbionts—as much measured controlled conditions many members legume plant family support nitrogenfixing symbionts cyanobacteria also capable nitrogen fixation phototrophs carry photosynthesis like nitrogenfixing bacteria either freeliving symbiotic relationships plants15 sources nitrogen include acid deposition produced combustion fossil fuels ammonia evaporates agricultural fields fertilizers applied dust15 anthropogenic nitrogen inputs account nitrogen fluxes ecosystems15
plant tissues shed eaten nitrogen tissues becomes available animals microbes microbial decomposition releases nitrogen compounds dead organic matter soil plants fungi bacteria compete soil bacteria organic nitrogencontaining compounds source carbon release ammonium ions soil process known nitrogen mineralization others convert ammonium nitrite nitrate ions process known nitrification nitric oxide nitrous oxide also produced nitrification15 nitrogenrich oxygenpoor conditions nitrates nitrites converted nitrogen process known denitrification15
important nutrients include phosphorus sulfur calcium potassium magnesium manganese22 phosphorus enters ecosystems weathering ecosystems supply diminishes making phosphoruslimitation common older landscapes especially tropics22 calcium sulfur also produced weathering acid deposition important source sulfur many ecosystems although magnesium manganese produced weathering exchanges soil organic matter living cells account significant portion ecosystem fluxes potassium primarily cycled living cells soil organic matter22
