impressions ideasedit
central doctrines humes philosophy stated first lines treatise notion mind consists mental perceptions mental objects present divide categories impressions ideas humes treatise thus opens words perceptions human mind resolve distinct kinds shall call impressions ideas hume states believe necessary employ many words explaining distinction commentators generally taken hume mean distinction feeling thinking62 controversially hume regard difference sense matter degree takes impressions distinguished ideas basis force liveliness vivacity henry allison calls criterion book hume63 ideas therefore faint impressions example experiencing painful sensation touching handle forceful simply thinking touching according hume impressions meant original form ideas garret thus coined term copy principle refer humes doctrine ideas ultimately copied original impression whether passion sensation derive6364

person’s imagination regardless boundless seem confined mind’s ability recombine information already acquired body’s sensory experience ideas derived impressions addition imagination takes basic ideas leads form ones directed three principles association namely resemblance contiguity cause effect66 principle resemblance refers tendency ideas become associated objects represent resemble another example person looking illustration flower conceive idea physical flower idea illustrated object associated idea physical object principle contiguity describes tendency ideas become associated objects represent near time space thought crayon leads person think crayon contiguous finally principle cause effect refers tendency ideas become associated objects represent causally related explains remembering broken window make someone think baseball caused window shatter
hume elaborates last principle cause effect person observes object event consistently produces object event results expectation particular event ‘cause’ followed another event ‘effect’ previously constantly associated it67 hume calls principle custom habit saying “custom…renders experience useful makes expect future similar train events appeared past68 however even though custom serve guide life still represents expectation words “experience cannot establish necessary connection cause effect imagine without contradiction case cause produce usual effect…the reason mistakenly infer something cause necessarily produces effect past experiences habituated think way69 continuing idea hume argues “only pure realm ideas logic mathematics contingent direct sense awareness reality causation safely…be applied sciences reduced probability70 uses skepticism reject metaphysics many theological views basis grounded fact observations therefore beyond reach human understanding
induction causationedit
cornerstone humes epistemology problem induction area humes thought scepticism human powers reason pronounced71 problem revolves around plausibility inductive reasoning reasoning observed behaviour objects behaviour unobserved hume wrote induction concerns things behave beyond present testimony senses records memory72 hume argues tend believe things behave regular manner meaning patterns behaviour objects seem persist future throughout unobserved present73 humes argument cannot rationally justify claim nature continue uniform justification comes varieties—demonstrative reasoning probable reasoningnote 1—and inadequate regard demonstrative reasoning hume argues uniformity principle cannot demonstrated consistent conceivable nature might stop regular75 turning probable reasoning hume argues cannot hold nature continue uniform past using sort reasoning induction question would circular reasoning76 thus form justification rationally warrant inductive inferences
humes solution problem argue rather reason natural instinct explains human practice making inductive inferences asserts nature absolute uncontroulable necessity determind judge well breathe feel agreeing philosopher john kenyon writes reason might manage raise doubt truth conclusion natural inductive inference moment sheer agreeableness animal faith protect excessive caution sterile suspension belief77 commentators charles sanders peirce demurred humes solution78 kant karl popper humes analysis posed fundamental challenge human knowledge claims79
notion causation closely linked problem induction according hume reason inductively associating constantly conjoined events mental association basis concept causation least three interpretations humes theory causation represented literature logical positivist sceptical realist quasirealist80
david hume acknowledged events constantly unfolding humanity cannot guarantee events caused events prior independent instances hume opposed widely accepted theory causation ‘all events specific course reason’ therefore hume crafted theory causation formed empiricist skeptic beliefs split causation realms “all objects human reason enquiry naturally divided kinds relations ideas matters fact”81 relations ideas priori represent universal bonds ideas mark cornerstones human thought matters fact dependent observer experience often universally held true among multiple persons hume empiricist meaning believed “causes effects discoverable reason experience”82 hume later goes onto even perspective past humanity cannot dictate future events thoughts past limited compared possibilities future hume’s separation matters fact relations ideas often referred “hume’s fork”83 hume explains theory causation causal inference division three different parts three branches explains ideas addition comparing contrasting views predecessors branches critical phase constructive phase belief84 critical phase hume denies predecessors theories causation next hume uses constructive phase resolve doubts reader observing critical phase “habit custom” mend gaps reasoning occur without human mind even realizing associating ideas become second nature human mind “makes expect future similar train events appeared past” however hume says association cannot trusted span human mind comprehend past necessarily applicable wide distant future leads hume third branch causal inference belief belief drives human mind hold expectancy future based past experience throughout explanation causal inference hume arguing future certain repetition past justify induction uniformity
logical positivist interpretation hume analyses causal propositions caused terms regularities perception causes equivalent whenever atype events happen btype ones follow whenever refers possible perceptions85 treatise human nature hume wrote

power necessity qualities perceptions objects felt soul perceivd externally bodies86

view rejected skeptical realists argue hume thought causation amounts regular succession events61 hume said events causally conjoined necessary connection underpins conjunction

shall rest contented relations contiguity succession affording complete idea causation means necessary connexion taken consideration87

philosopher angela coventry writes hume nothing particular instance cause effect involving external objects suggests idea power necessary connection ignorant powers operate objects88 however denying possibility knowing powers objects hume accepted causal principle writing never asserted absurd proposition something could arise without cause89
argued hume think causation reducible pure regularity fully fledged realist either philosopher simon blackburn calls quasirealist reading90 blackburn writes someone talking cause voicing distinct mental means state someone merely describing regular sequences91 humes words nothing usual apply external bodies every internal sensation occasion92

practical reasonedit
essential question practical reason hume whether standards principles exist practical reason also authoritative rational beings dictating people’s intentions actions hume mainly considered antirationalist denying possibility practical reason principle exist although philosophers christine korsgaard jean hampton elijah millgram claim hume much antirationalist skeptic practical reason101
hume denied existence practical reason principle claimed reason effect morality since morality capable producing effects people reason alone cannot create hume explains treatise human nature 1740 “morals excite passions produce prevent actions reason utterly impotent particular rules morality therefore conclusions reason”102
since practical reason supposed regulate actions theory hume denied practical reason grounds reason cannot directly oppose passions hume puts “reason ought slave passions never pretend office serve obey them” reason less significant passion reason original influence passion original existence modification existence103
practical reason also concerned value actions rather truth propositions104 hume believed reason’s shortcoming affecting morality proved practical reason could authoritative rational beings since morality essential dictating people’s intentions actions

free determinism responsibilityedit
hume along thomas hobbes cited classical compatibilist notions freedom determinism121 thesis compatibilism seeks reconcile human freedom mechanist belief human beings part deterministic universe whose happenings governed physical laws hume influenced greatly scientific revolution particular isaac newton122 hume argued dispute compatibility freedom determinism continued thousand years ambiguous terminology wrote circumstance alone controversy long kept foot presume ambiguity expression different disputants different meanings terms123124
hume defines concept necessity uniformity observable operations nature similar objects constantly conjoined together125 liberty power acting acting according determinations will126 argues according definitions compatible liberty requires necessity actions necessitated sense would little connexion motives inclinations circumstances follow certain degree uniformity actions thus connected actions never free would matters chance universally allowed existence127 australian philosopher john passmore writes confusion arisen necessity taken mean necessary connexion abandoned hume argues liberty necessity found conflict another124

however works superstition enthusiasm hume specifically seems support standard religious views time place still meant could critical catholic church dismissing standard protestant accusations superstition idolatry139140 well dismissing idolatry compatriots uncivilised beliefs141 also considered extreme protestant sects members called enthusiasts corrupters religion142 contrast natural history religion hume presented arguments suggesting polytheism much commend monotheism143
philosopher paul russell writes likely hume sceptical religious belief extent complete atheism suggests perhaps humes position best characterised term irreligion144 philosopher david oconnor argues humes final position weakly deistic oconnor humes position deeply ironic inclining towards weak form deism seriously doubts ever find sufficiently favourable balance evidence justify accepting religious position adds hume believe standard theism rule concepts deity ambiguity suited purposes creates difficulty definitively pinning final position religion145
design argumentedit
traditional topics natural theology existence posteriori arguments argument design teleological argument argument existence proved design obvious complexity world encyclopædia britannica states popular accessible theistic arguments identifies evidences design nature inferring divine designer fact universe whole coherent efficiently functioning system likewise view indicates divine intelligence behind it146unreliable source
enquiry concerning human understanding hume wrote design argument seems depend upon experience proponents always suppose universe effect quite singular unparalleled proof deity cause less singular unparalleled147 philosopher louise loeb notes hume saying experience observation guide making inferences conjunction events however according hume observe neither universes hence conjunction involving observed conjunction ground inference either extended objects unobserved causes148
hume also criticised argument dialogues concerning natural religion 1779 suggested even world less smoothly functioning system result chance permutations particles falling temporary permanent selfsustaining order thus appearance design146
century later idea order without design rendered plausible charles darwins discovery adaptations forms life result natural selection inherited characteristics146 philosopher james madden hume rivaled darwin done undermine principle confidence arguments design among figures western intellectual tradition149
finally hume discussed version anthropic principle idea theories universe constrained need allow mans existence observer hume sceptical mouthpiece philo suggest many worlds produced incompetent designer called stupid mechanic dialogues concerning natural religion hume wrote

problem miraclesedit
main article miracles
discussion miracles hume argues believe miracles occurred therefore provide reason think exists152 enquiry concerning human understanding section hume defines miracle transgression nature particular volition deity interposition invisible agent hume says believe event frequently occurred likely occur also take account instances event occur hume wrote

wise considers side supported greater number experiments hundred instances experiments side fifty another afford doubtful expectation event though hundred uniform experiments contradictory reasonably beget pretty strong degree assurance cases must balance opposite experiments deduct smaller number greater order know exact force superior evidence153

hume discusses testimony report miracles wrote testimony might doubted even great authority case facts credible evidence resulting testimony admits diminution greater less proportion fact less unusual154
although hume leaves open possibility miracles occur reported offers various arguments ever happened history155 points people often good reasons miracles occurring either believe benefit religion fame results furthermore people nature enjoy relating miracles heard without caring veracity thus miracles easily transmitted even false also hume notes miracles seem occur mostly ignorant barbarous nations156 times reason occur civilised societies societies awed know natural events finally miracles religion argue religions miracles even proportion reported miracles across world humes requirement belief miracles religion make less likely157
hume extremely pleased argument miracles enquiry states flatter discovered argument like nature wise learned everlasting check kinds superstitious delusion consequently useful long world endures158 thus humes argument miracles abstract basis founded upon scrutiny primarily miracles forms belief systems common sense notion veracity based upon epistemological evidence founded principle rationality proportionality reasonability157
criterion assessing belief system hume based balance probability whether something likely occurred since weight empirical experience contradicts notion existence miracles accounts treated scepticism myriad accounts miracles contradict another people receive miracles prove authority jesus whereas others prove authority muhammad religious prophet deity various differing accounts weaken overall evidential power miracles159not citation given
despite hume observes belief miracles popular gazing populace receive greedily without examination whatever soothes superstition promotes wonder160
critics argued humes position assumes character miracles natural laws prior specific examination miracle claims thus amounts subtle form begging question assume testimony homogeneous reference group seems unwise compare private miracles public miracles unintellectual observers intellectual observers little gain much lose much gain little lose convincing many indeed many argued miracles contradict laws nature require laws nature intelligible miraculous thus subverting nature example william adams remarks must ordinary course nature anything extraordinary must stream anything interrupted161 also noted requires appeal inductive inference none observed every part nature examined every possible miracle claim instance future humes philosophy especially problematic162
little appreciated voluminous literature either foreshadowing hume likes thomas sherlock163 directly responding engaging hume william paley164 william adams165 john douglas166 john leland george campbell168 among others campbell rumoured read campbells dissertation hume remarked scotch theologue beaten him169
humes main argument concerning miracles miracles definition singular events differ established laws nature natural laws codified result past experiences therefore miracle violation prior experience thus incapable basis reasonable belief however probability something occurred contradiction past experience always judged less probability either ones senses deceived person recounting miraculous occurrence lying mistaken hume would past experience hume refusal grant credence guarantee correctness offers example indian prince grown country refuses believe water frozen humes lights refusal wrong prince reasoned justly presumably extensive experience freezing water warrant believe event could occur154
hume either miraculous event become recurrent event else never rational believe occurred connection religious belief left unexplained throughout except close discussion hume notes reliance christianity upon testimony miraculous occurrences makes ironic remark anyone moved faith assent revealed testimony conscious continued miracle person subverts principles understanding gives determination believe contrary custom experience170171 hume writes testimony ever really given miracle ever given subject derision154
