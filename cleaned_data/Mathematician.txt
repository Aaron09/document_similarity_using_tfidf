earliest known mathematicians thales miletus 624–c546 hailed first true mathematician first known individual mathematical discovery attributed1 credited first deductive reasoning applied geometry deriving four corollaries thales theorem
number known mathematicians grew pythagoras samos 582–c established pythagorean school whose doctrine mathematics ruled universe whose motto number2 pythagoreans coined term mathematics study mathematics sake begins
first woman mathematician recorded history hypatia alexandria succeeded father librarian great library wrote many works applied mathematics political dispute christian community alexandria punished presuming involved stripping naked scraping skin clamshells roofing tiles3
science mathematics islamic world middle ages followed various models modes funding varied based primarily scholars extensive patronage strong intellectual policies implemented specific rulers allowed scientific knowledge develop many areas funding translation scientific texts languages ongoing throughout reign certain caliphs4 turned certain scholars became experts works translated turn received support continuing develop certain sciences sciences received wider attention elite scholars invited funded study particular sciences example translator mathematician benefited type support alkhawarizmi notable feature many scholars working muslim rule medieval times often polymaths examples include work optics maths astronomy alhaytham
renaissance brought increased emphasis mathematics science europe period transition mainly feudal ecclesiastical culture predominantly secular many notable mathematicians occupations luca pacioli founder accounting niccolò fontana tartaglia notable engineer bookkeeper gerolamo cardano earliest founder probability binomial expansion robert recorde physician françois viète lawyer
time passed many mathematicians gravitated towards universities emphasis free thinking experimentation begun britains oldest universities beginning seventeenth century oxford scientists robert hooke robert boyle cambridge isaac newton lucasian professor mathematics physics moving 19th century objective universities across europe evolved teaching “regurgitation knowledge” “encouraging productive thinking”5 1810 humboldt convinced king prussia build university berlin based friedrich schleiermacher’s liberal ideas goal demonstrate process discovery knowledge teach students “take account fundamental laws science thinking” thus seminars laboratories started evolve6
british universities period adopted approaches familiar italian german universities already enjoyed substantial freedoms autonomy changes begun enlightenment influences inspired humboldt universities oxford cambridge emphasized importance research arguably authentically implementing humboldt’s idea university even german universities subject state authority7 overall science including mathematics became focus universities 19th 20th centuries students could conduct research seminars laboratories began produce doctoral theses scientific content8 according humboldt mission university berlin pursue scientific knowledge9 german university system fostered professional bureaucratically regulated scientific research performed wellequipped laboratories instead kind research done private individual scholars great britain france10 fact rüegg asserts german system responsible development modern research university focused idea “freedom scientific research teaching study”11
required education
mathematicians usually cover breadth topics within mathematics undergraduate education proceed specialize topics choice graduate level universities qualifying exam serves test breadth depth students understanding mathematics students pass permitted work doctoral dissertation
activities
applied mathematics
main article applied mathematics
mathematicians involved solving problems applications real life called applied mathematicians applied mathematicians mathematical scientists specialized knowledge professional methodology approach many imposing problems presented related scientific fields professional focus wide variety problems theoretical systems localized constructs applied mathematicians work regularly study formulation mathematical models mathematicians applied mathematicians considered stem science technology engineering mathematics careerscitation needed
discipline applied mathematics concerns mathematical methods typically used science engineering business industry thus applied mathematics mathematical science specialized knowledge term applied mathematics also describes professional specialty mathematicians work problems often concrete sometimes abstract professionals focused problem solving applied mathematicians look formulation study mathematical models science engineering business areas mathematical practice
abstract mathematics
main article pure mathematics
pure mathematics mathematics studies entirely abstract concepts eighteenth century onwards recognized category mathematical activity sometimes characterized speculative mathematics12 variance trend towards meeting needs navigation astronomy physics economics engineering applications
another insightful view forth pure mathematics necessarily applied mathematics possible study abstract entities respect intrinsic nature concerned manifest real world13 even though pure applied viewpoints distinct philosophical positions practice much overlap activity pure applied mathematicians
develop accurate models describing real world many applied mathematicians draw tools techniques often considered pure mathematics hand many pure mathematicians draw natural social phenomena inspiration abstract research
mathematics teaching
many professional mathematicians also engage teaching mathematics duties include

teaching university mathematics courses
supervising undergraduate graduate research
serving academic committees

consulting
many careers mathematics outside universities involve consulting instance actuaries assemble analyze data estimate probability likely cost occurrence event death sickness injury disability loss property actuaries also address financial questions including involving level pension contributions required produce certain retirement income company invest resources maximize return investments light potential risk using broad knowledge actuaries help design price insurance policies pension plans financial strategies manner help ensure plans maintained sound financial basis
another example mathematical finance derive extend mathematical numerical models without necessarily establishing link financial theory taking observed market prices input mathematical consistency required compatibility economic theory thus example financial economist might study structural reasons company certain share price financial mathematician take share price given attempt stochastic calculus obtain corresponding value derivatives stock valuation options financial modeling
