viking expansion europe 11th centuries yellow colour corresponds expansion normans partly descending vikings


ongoing debate among scholars scandinavians began expand 11th centuries

demographic model
model suggests scandinavia experienced population boom viking began16 agricultural capabilities land enough keep increasing population17 result many scandinavians found property status remedy landless took piracy obtain material wealth population continued grow pirates looked beyond borders baltic eventually europe18


economic model
economic model states viking result growing urbanism trade throughout mainland europe islamic world grew trade routes wealth moved along pushed north19 western europe protourban centres wich town anglosaxon england began boom prosperous known long eighth century20 scandinavians like many europeans drawn wealthier urban centres soon became frequent targets viking raids connection scandinavians larger richer trade networks lured vikings western europe soon rest europe parts middle east england hoards viking silver cuerdale hoard vale york hoard offer good insight phenomenon


ideological model
coincided medieval warm period 800–1300 stopped start little 1250–1850 start viking sack lindisfarne also coincided charlemagnes saxon wars christian wars pagans saxony historians rudolf simek bruno dumézil theorise viking attacks response spread christianity among pagan peoples23456 professor rudolf simek believes coincidence early viking activity occurred reign charlemagne221 penetration christianity scandinavia serious conflict divided norway almost century22


political model
main components political model first case external pull factor pull factor suggests weak political bodies britain western europe made attractive target viking raiders reasons weaknesses vary generally simplified decentralized polities religious sites result viking raiders found easy sack retreat areas thus frequently raided second case internal push factor push factor coincides period viking scandinavia undergoing mass centralization power modern countries denmark sweden especially norway centralization power forced hundreds chieftains lands slowly eaten kings dynasties began emerge result many chiefs sought refuge elsewhere began harrying coasts british isles western europe23


technological model
model suggests viking occurred result technological innovations allowed vikings raids first place24 doubt piracy existed baltic viking developments sailing technology practice made possible early viking raiders attack lands away25 among developments included larger sails tacking practices 24hour sailing16

models constitute much know motivations causes viking likelihood beginning result combinations aforementioned models
