genetic genealogical relationshipsedit
term genetic relationship meant genealogical sense historical linguistics groups languages spoken world today relatively small number families according reconstructed descent common ancestral languages example english related indoeuropean languages mandarin related sinotibetan languages criterion language isolate constitutes family explains exceptional interest languages received linguists2
looking relationshipsedit
possible natural languages spoken world today related direct indirect descent single ancestral tongue established language families would upper branches genealogical tree languages equally lower progeny parent tongue reason language isolates object numerous studies seeking uncover genealogy instance basque compared every living extinct eurasian language family known sumerian south caucasian without conclusive results
situations language ancestor might arise frequently happens sign languages famously case nicaraguan sign language deaf children language placed together developed language similarly deaf parents raise group hearing children contact others adulthood might develop oral language among keep using later teaching children eventually could develop fullfledged language population unsigned languages likely occur time tens thousands years human prehistory likelihood occurring least times increases also creole languages constructed languages esperanto descend directly single ancestor become language population however take elements existing languages
extinct isolatesedit
caution required speaking extinct languages isolates despite great sumerian elamite safely classified isolates languages well enough known modern relatives existed would recognizably related
however many extinct languages poorly attested fact cannot linked languages reflection poor knowledge etruscan example sometimes claimed indoeuropean although historical linguists believe unlikely possible resolve issue hattian gutian3 hurrian mannean kassite also believed isolates mainstream majority status disputed minority linguists similar situations pertain many extinct isolates americas beothuk cayuse language thought isolate turn relatable languages enough material recovered material unlikely recovered language written
sign language isolatesedit
information deafcommunity sign language village sign language
number sign languages arisen independently without ancestral language thus true language isolates famous nicaraguan sign language well documented case happened schools deaf many countries tanzania example seven schools deaf sign language known connection language4 sign languages also developed outside schools communities high incidences deafness kata kolok bali adamorobe sign language ghana urubú sign language brazil several mayan sign languages half dozen sign languages hill tribes thailand including khor sign language
studies also conducted alsayyid bedouin sign language absl isolated village israel language developed isolation years deaf hearing people within village5
presumed isolates small local families many deaf communities made people whose hearing parents sign language manifestly shown language borrowed sign language deaf communities recorded history languagescitation needed
