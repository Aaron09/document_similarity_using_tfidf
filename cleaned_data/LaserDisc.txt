laserdisc number advantages featured sharper picture horizontal resolution lines ntsc lines discs featured lines25 ntsc could handle analog digital audio mostly analog audio professional applications uncommon ntsc discs could store multiple audio tracks allowed extras like directors commentary tracks features added onto film creating special edition releases would possible disc access random chapter based like format meaning could jump point given disc quickly comparison would require tedious rewinding fastforwarding specific points
laserdiscs initially cheaper videocassettes manufacture lacked moving parts plastic outer shell necessary tapes work duplication process much simpler cassette least parts including actual tape laserdisc part five layers disc stamped matter seconds whereas duplicating videotape required complex bulk tape duplication mechanism timeconsuming process however 1980s average discpressing prices twosided disc large amount plastic material costly glassmastering process needed make metal stamper mechanisms larger volume demand videocassettes quickly became much cheaper duplicate costing little beginning 1990s

advantagesedit
laserdisc players provide great degree control playback process unlike many players transport mechanism always obeys commands user pause fastforward fastreverse commands always accepted barring course malfunctions user prohibited options content protection code instructs player refuse commands skip specific part fast forwarding copyright warnings players particularly higherend units ability ignore blocking code play video without restrictions feature common usual consumer market
laserdiscs user jump directly individual frame video simply entering frame number remote keypad feature common among players players cache features stores certain amount video allows player index quickly even frame players
damaged spots laserdisc played skipped often become unplayable past damage newer players feature repairskip algorithm alleviates problem continuing play disc filling unreadable areas picture blank space frozen frame last readable image sound success feature depends upon amount damage laserdisc players working full analog recover errors faster players direct comparison almost impossible sheer size differences media scratch probably cause problems scratch laserdisc fingerprint taking area would almost certainly cause fewer problems similar mark covering surface laserdisccitation needed
similar versus sound quality debates common audiophile community videophiles argue laserdisc maintains smoother filmlike natural image still looks slightly artificial early demo discs often compression encoding problems lending additional support claims time however video signaltonoise ratio bandwidth laserdisc substantially less dvds making dvds appear sharper clearer viewers
another advantage least consumers lack sort antipiracy technology claimed macrovisions copyguard protection could applied laserdisc formats design vertical blanking interval macrovision signal would implemented also used timecode andor frame coding well player control codes laserdisc players test discs macrovision would play never push redesign format despite obvious potential piracy relatively small market share industry simply decided engineer specification
laserdiscs support multiple audio tracks allowed vast supplemental materials included ondisc made first available format special edition releases 1984 criterion collection edition citizen kane generally credited first special edition release home videocitation needed setting standard future discs measured disc provided interviews commentary tracks documentaries still photographs features historians collectors
disadvantagesedit
despite advantages competing technology time namely betamax format drawbacks discs heavy weighing grams half pound cumbersome prone tape damage mishandled manufacturers market units recording capabilities consumers also size greater mechanical effort required spin discs proper speed resulting much noise generated media

analog information encoded laserdiscs include form builtin checksum error correction slight dust scratches disc surface result readerrors cause various video quality problems glitches streaks bursts static momentary picture interruptions contrast digital mpeg2 format information used dvds builtin error correction ensures signal damaged disc remain identical perfect disc right point damage disc surface substantial prevents laser able identify usable data
addition laserdisc videos sometimes exhibit problem known crosstalk issue arise laser optical pickup assembly within player alignment disc damaged excessively warped could also occur even properly functioning player factorynew disc depending electrical mechanical alignment problems instances issue arose fact discs require subtle changes rotating speed various points playback change speed optical pickup inside player might read video information track adjacent intended causing data tracks cross extra video information picked second track shows distortion picture looks reminiscent swirling barber poles rolling lines static
assuming players optical pickup proper working order crosstalk distortion normally occur playback format laserdiscs rotational speed never varies however player calibration order disc faulty damaged problems affecting tracking accuracy occur problem laser lock player reads fields given frame causing picture look frozen movie paused
another significant issue unique laserdisc involving inconsistency playback quality different makers models player televisions given player produce picture visually indistinguishable units differences image quality players becomes easily apparent large televisions substantial leaps image quality generally obtained expensive highend players allow postprocessing mpeg2 stream playback contrast laserdisc playback quality highly dependent hardware quality major variances picture quality appear different makers models players even tested midrange television obvious benefits using high quality equipment helped keep demand players high thus also keeping pricing units comparably high 1990s notable players sold anywhere us200 well 1000 older less desirable players could purchased working condition little
