descriptionedit
inductive reasoning inherently uncertain deals degrees given premises conclusion credible according theory evidence examples include manyvalued logic dempster–shafer theory probability theory rules inference bayes rule unlike deductive reasoning rely universals holding closed domain discourse draw conclusions applicable even cases epistemic uncertainty technical issues arise however example second axiom probability closedworld assumption3
example inductive argument

biological life forms know depend liquid water exist
therefore discover biological life form probably depend liquid water exist

argument could made every time biological life form found would correct every time however still possible future biological life form requiring liquid water could discovered
result argument stated less formally

biological life forms know depend liquid water exist
biological life probably depends liquid water exist

inductive deductive reasoningedit




argument terminology


unlike deductive arguments inductive reasoning allows possibility conclusion false even premises true4 instead valid invalid inductive arguments either strong weak describes probable conclusion true5 another crucial difference deductive certainty impossible nonaxiomatic systems reality leaving inductive reasoning primary route probabilistic knowledge systems6
given true would cause true example deduction would true therefore deduce true example induction would observed true therefore might true reasonable explanation true
example

large enough asteroid impact would create large crater cause severe impact winter could drive nonavian dinosaurs extinction
observe large crater gulf mexico dating near time extinction nonavian dinosaurs
therefore possible impact could explain nonavian dinosaurs became extinct

note however necessarily case events also coincide extinction nonavian dinosaurs example deccan traps india
classical example incorrect inductive argument presented john vickers

swans seen white
therefore swans white precisely expect swans white

definition inductive reasoning described article excludes mathematical induction form deductive reasoning used strictly prove properties recursively defined sets7
criticismedit
main article problem induction
inductive reasoning criticized thinkers diverse sextus empiricus8 karl popper9
classic philosophical treatment problem induction given scottish philosopher david hume10
although inductive reasoning demonstrates considerable success application questionable recognizing hume highlighted fact mind draws uncertain conclusions relatively limited experiences deduction truth value conclusion based truth premise induction however dependence premise always uncertain example lets assume ravens black fact numerous black ravens supports assumption however assumption becomes inconsistent fact white ravens therefore general rule ravens black inconsistent existence white raven hume argued impossible justify inductive reasoning specifically cannot justified deductively option justify inductively since circular concluded induction unjustifiable help humes fork11
however hume stated even induction proved unreliable would still rely instead position severe skepticism hume advocated practical skepticism based common sense inevitability induction accepted12
bertrand russell illustrated skepticism story turkey every morning without fail following laws induction concludes continue throat thanksgiving day13
biasesedit
inductive reasoning also known hypothesis construction conclusions made based current knowledge predictionscitation needed deductive arguments biases distort proper application inductive argument thereby preventing reasoner forming logical conclusion based clues examples biases include availability heuristic confirmation bias predictableworld bias
availability heuristic causes reasoner depend primarily upon information readily available himher people tendency rely information easily accessible world around example surveys people asked estimate percentage people died various causes respondents would choose causes prevalent media terrorism murders airplane accidents rather causes disease traffic accidents technically less accessible individual since emphasized heavily world around himher
confirmation bias based natural tendency confirm rather deny current hypothesis research demonstrated people inclined seek solutions problems consistent known hypotheses rather attempt refute hypotheses often experiments subjects questions seek answers established hypotheses thus confirming hypotheses example hypothesized sally sociable individual subjects naturally seek confirm premise asking questions would produce answers confirming sally fact sociable individual
predictableworld bias revolves around inclination perceive order proved exist either particular level abstraction gambling example popular examples predictableworld bias gamblers often begin think simple obvious patterns outcomes therefore believe able predict outcomes based upon witnessed reality however outcomes games difficult predict highly complex nature however general people tend seek type simplistic order explain justify beliefs experiences often difficult realise perceptions order entirely different truth14
typesedit
generalizationedit
generalization accurately inductive generalization proceeds premise sample conclusion population

proportion sample attribute
therefore
proportion population attribute


example

balls—either black white—in estimate respective numbers draw sample four balls find three black white good inductive generalization would black five white balls
much premises support conclusion depends upon number sample group number population degree sample represents population achieved taking random sample hasty generalization biased sample generalization fallacies
statistical syllogismedit
main article statistical syllogism
statistical syllogism proceeds generalization conclusion individual

proportion population attribute
individual member
therefore
probability corresponds

proportion first premise would something like 35ths dicto simpliciter fallacies occur statistical syllogisms accident converse accident
simple inductionedit
simple induction proceeds premise sample group conclusion another individual

proportion known instances population attribute
individual another member
therefore
probability corresponding

combination generalization statistical syllogism conclusion generalization also first premise statistical syllogism
argument analogyedit
main article argument analogy
process analogical inference involves noting shared properties things basis inferring also share property15

similar respect properties
object observed property
therefore probably property also

analogical reasoning frequent common sense science philosophy humanities sometimes accepted auxiliary method refined approach casebased reasoning16
causal inferenceedit
causal inference draws conclusion causal connection based conditions occurrence effect premises correlation things indicate causal relationship additional factors must confirmed establish exact form causal relationship
predictionedit
prediction draws conclusion future individual past sample

proportion observed members group attribute
therefore
probability corresponding members group attribute next observed

bayesian inferenceedit
logic induction rather theory belief bayesian inference determine beliefs priori rational rather determines rationally change beliefs presented evidence begin committing prior probability hypothesis based logic previous experience faced evidence adjust strength belief hypothesis precise manner using bayesian logic
inductive inferenceedit
around 1960 solomonoff founded theory universal inductive inference theory prediction based observations example predicting next symbol based upon given series symbols formal inductive framework combines algorithmic information theory bayesian framework universal inductive inference based solid philosophical foundations17 considered mathematically formalized occams razor fundamental ingredients theory concepts algorithmic probability kolmogorov complexity
