surveying mapping important fields application geodesy general types coordinate systems used plane

planopolar points plane defined distance specified point along specified direction respect base line axis
rectangular points defined distances perpendicular axes called geodetic practice—contrary mathematical convention—to xaxis point north yaxis east

rectangular coordinates plane used intuitively respect ones current location case xaxis point local north formally coordinates obtained threedimensional coordinates using artifice projection possible curved surface earth onto flat surface without deformation compromise often chosen—called conformal projection—preserves angles length ratios small circles mapped small circles small squares squares

heightsedit
geodesy point terrain heights level irregular physically defined surface therefore height ideally referred coordinate like physical quantity though tempting treat height vertical coordinate addition horizontal coordinates though actually good approximation physical reality small areas quickly becomes invalid regional considerationsspecify
heights come following variants

orthometric heights
normal heights
geopotential heights

advantages disadvantages orthometric normal heights heights metres level whereas geopotential numbers measures potential energy unit metric orthometric normal heights differ precise mean level conceptually continued continental masses reference surface orthometric heights geoid equipotential surface approximating mean level
none heights related geodetic ellipsoidial heights express height point reference ellipsoid satellite positioning receivers typically provide ellipsoidal heights unless fitted special conversion software based model geoid
geodetic dataedit
geodetic point coordinates heights always obtained system constructed using real observations geodesists introduce concept geodetic datum physical realization coordinate system used describing point locations realization result choosing conventional coordinate values datum points
case height data suffices choose datum point reference bench mark typically tide gauge shore thus vertical data like normaal amsterdams peil north american vertical datum 1988 navd kronstadt datum trieste datum
case plane spatial coordinates typically need several datum points regional ellipsoidal datum like fixed prescribing undulation geoid deflection vertical datum point case helmert tower potsdam however overdetermined ensemble datum points also used
changing coordinates point referring datum make refer another datum called datum transformation case vertical data consists simply adding constant shift height values case plane spatial coordinates datum transformation takes form similarity helmert transformation consisting rotation scaling operation addition simple translation plane helmert transformation four parameters space seven
note terminologyedit
