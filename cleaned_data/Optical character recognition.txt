early optical character recognition traced technologies involving telegraphy creating reading devices blind3 1914 emanuel goldberg developed machine read characters converted standard telegraph codecitation needed concurrently edmund fournier dalbe developed optophone handheld scanner moved across printed page produced tones corresponded specific letters characters4
late 1920s 1930s emanuel goldberg developed called statistical machine searching microfilm archives using optical code recognition system 1931 granted patent number 1838389 invention patent acquired

typesedit

optical character recognition targets typewritten text glyph character time
optical word recognition targets typewritten text word time languages space word divider usually called
intelligent character recognition also targets handwritten printscript cursive text glyph character time usually involving machine learning
intelligent word recognition also targets handwritten printscript cursive text word time especially useful languages glyphs separated cursive script

generally offline process analyses static document handwriting movement analysis used input handwriting recognition13 instead merely using shapes glyphs words technique able capture motions order segments drawn direction pattern putting lifting additional information make endtoend process accurate technology also known online character recognition dynamic character recognition realtime character recognition intelligent character recognition
techniquesedit
preprocessingedit
software often preprocesses images improve chances successful recognition techniques include14

deskew document aligned properly scanned need tilted degrees clockwise counterclockwise order make lines text perfectly horizontal vertical
despeckle remove positive negative spots smoothing edges
binarisation convert image color greyscale blackandwhite called binary image colours task binarisation performed simple separating text desired image component background15 task binarisation necessary since commercial recognition algorithms work binary images since proves simpler so16 addition effectiveness binarisation step influences significant extent quality character recognition stage careful decisions made choice binarisation employed given input image type since quality binarisation method employed obtain binary result depends type input image scanned document scene text image historical degraded document etc1718
line removal cleans nonglyph boxes lines
layout analysis zoning identifies columns paragraphs captions distinct blocks especially important multicolumn layouts tables
line word detection establishes baseline word character shapes separates words necessary
script recognition multilingual documents script change level words hence identification script necessary right invoked handle specific script19
character isolation segmentation percharacter multiple characters connected image artifacts must separated single characters broken multiple pieces artifacts must connected
normalise aspect ratio scale20

segmentation fixedpitch fonts accomplished relatively simply aligning image uniform grid based vertical grid lines least often intersect black areas proportional fonts sophisticated techniques needed whitespace letters sometimes greater words vertical lines intersect character21
character recognitionedit
basic types core algorithm produce ranked list candidate characters22
matrix matching involves comparing image stored glyph pixelbypixel basis also known pattern matching pattern recognition image correlation relies input glyph correctly isolated rest image stored glyph similar font scale technique works best typewritten text work well fonts encountered technique early physical photocellbased implemented rather directly
feature extraction decomposes glyphs features like lines closed loops line direction line intersections extraction features reduces dimensionality representation makes recognition process computationally efficient features compared abstract vectorlike representation character might reduce glyph prototypes general techniques feature detection computer vision applicable type commonly seen intelligent handwriting recognition indeed modern software23 nearest neighbour classifiers knearest neighbors algorithm used compare image features stored glyph features choose nearest match24
software cuneiform tesseract twopass approach character recognition second pass known adaptive recognition uses letter shapes recognised high confidence first pass recognise better remaining letters second pass advantageous unusual fonts lowquality scans font distorted blurred faded21
result stored standardised alto format dedicated schema maintained united states library congress
list optical character recognition software comparison optical character recognition software
postprocessingedit
accuracy increased output constrained lexicon list words allowed occur document14 might example words english language technical lexicon specific field technique problematic document contains words lexicon like proper nouns tesseract uses dictionary influence character segmentation step improved accuracy21
output stream plain text stream file characters sophisticated systems preserve original layout page produce example annotated includes original image page searchable textual representation
nearneighbor analysis make cooccurrence frequencies correct errors noting certain words often seen together25 example washington generally common english washington
knowledge grammar language scanned also help determine word likely verb noun example allowing greater accuracy
levenshtein distance algorithm also used postprocessing optimize results api26
applicationspecific optimisationsedit
recent yearswhen major technology providers began tweak systems better deal specific types input beyond applicationspecific lexicon better performance taking account business rules standard expressionclarification needed rich information contained color images strategy called applicationoriented customised applied license plates invoices screenshots cards driver licenses automobile manufacturing
workaroundsedit
several techniques solving problem character recognition means improved algorithms
forcing better inputedit
special fonts like ocra ocrb micr fonts precisely specified sizing spacing distinctive character shapes allow higher accuracy rate transcription often used early matrixmatching systems
comb fields preprinted boxes encourage humans write legibly glyph box25 often printed dropout color easily removed system25
palm used special glyphs known graffiti similar printed english characters simplified modified easier recognition platforms computationally limited hardware users would need learn write special glyphs
zonebased restricts image specific part document often referred template
crowdsourcingedit
crowdsourcing humans perform character recognition quickly process images like computerdriven higher accuracy recognising images obtained computers practical systems include amazon mechanical turk recaptcha national library finland developed online interface users correct ocred texts standardised alto format27 crowdsourcing also used perform character recognition directly invite software developers develop image processing algorithms example rankorder tournaments28
