modern physicists science writers—such paul davies john gribbin—have argued materialism disproven certain scientific findings physics quantum mechanics chaos theory 1991 gribbin davies released book matter myth first chapter death materialism contained following passage

came quantum theory totally transformed image matter assumption microscopic world atoms simply scaleddown version everyday world abandoned newtons deterministic machine replaced shadowy paradoxical conjunction waves particles governed laws chance rather rigid rules causality extension quantum theory goes beyond even paints picture solid matter dissolves away replaced weird excitations vibrations invisible field energy quantum physics undermines materialism reveals matter less substance might believe another development goes even demolishing newtons image matter inert lumps development theory chaos recently gained widespread attention
paul davies john gribbin matter myth chapter

davies gribbins objections shared proponents digital physics view information rather matter fundamental objections also shared founders quantum theory planck wrote
