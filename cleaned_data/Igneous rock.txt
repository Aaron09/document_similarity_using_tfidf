geological significance
igneous metamorphic rocks make 90–95 earths crust volume1 igneous rocks form earths current land surfacenote earths oceanic crust made igneous rock
igneous rocks also geologically important

minerals global chemistry give information composition mantle igneous rocks extracted temperature pressure conditions allowed extraction andor preexisting rock melted
absolute ages obtained various forms radiometric dating thus compared adjacent geological strata allowing time sequence events
features usually characteristic specific tectonic environment allowing tectonic reconstitutions plate tectonics
special circumstances host important mineral deposits ores example tungsten uranium commonly associated granites diorites whereas ores chromium platinum commonly associated gabbros

intrusive igneous rocks formed magma cools solidifies within crust planet surrounded preexisting rock called country rock magma cools slowly result rocks coarsegrained mineral grains rocks generally identified naked intrusive rocks also classified according shape size intrusive body relation formations intrudes typical intrusive formations batholiths stocks laccoliths sills dikes magma solidifies within earths crust cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks granite gabbro diorite

mineralogical classification
