main article diabetes mellitus type
diabetes mellitus type common form diabetes causes high blood sugar form diabetes usually combination insulin resistance impaired insulin secretion genetic environmental factors playing important role development disease management type diabetes relies series changes diet physical activity purpose reducing blood sugar levels normal ranges increasing insulin sensitivity30 biguanides metformin also used part treatment along insulin therapy32
historyedit
pancreas first identified herophilus 335–280 greek anatomist surgeon33 hundred years later rufus ephesus another greek anatomist gave pancreas name etymologically term pancreas modern latin adaptation greek πάγκρεας34 whole κρέας flesh35 originally means sweetbread36 although literally meaning allflesh presumably fleshy consistency 1889 oskar minkowski discovered removing pancreas caused become diabetic insulin later discovered frederick banting charles herbert best 1921
organ mentioned prominently 1992 film encino pauly shores character stoney often refers organ unrelated contexts perhaps demonstrating fundamental misunderstanding pancreas
animalsedit
pancreatic tissue present vertebrates precise form arrangement varies widely three separate pancreases arise ventral buds dorsally species including humans fuse adult several exceptions even single pancreas present three pancreatic ducts persist draining separately duodenum equivalent part foregut birds example typically three ducts37
teleosts species rabbits discrete pancreas pancreatic tissue distributed diffusely across mesentery even within nearby organs liver spleen teleost species endocrine tissue fused form distinct gland within abdominal cavity otherwise distributed among exocrine components primitive arrangement however appears lampreys lungfish pancreatic tissue found number discrete nodules within wall exocrine portions little different glandular structures intestine37
