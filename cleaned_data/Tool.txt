main article history technology
anthropologists believe tools important step evolution mankind1 tools used extensively humans wild chimpanzees widely assumed first routine tools took place prior divergence species2 early tools however likely made perishable materials sticks consisted unmodified stones cannot distinguished stones tools
stone artifacts date back million years ago3 however 2010 study suggests hominin species australopithecus afarensis meat carving animal carcasses stone implements finding pushes back earliest known stone tools among hominins million years ago4
finds actual tools date back least million years ethiopia5 earliest distinguishable stone tool forms hand
recently weapons found digs tools “early man” studied given importance tools recognized culturally historically relevant well hunting activities required tools preparing food “…nutting leatherworking grain harvesting woodworking…” included group “flake stone tools
tools important items ancient humans used climb food chain inventing tools able accomplish tasks human bodies could using spear arrow kill prey since teeth sharp enough pierce many animals skins “man hunter” catalyst hominin change questioned based marks bones archaeological sites evident prehumans scavenging predators carcasses rather killing food6
mechanical devices experienced major expansion ancient greece ancient rome systematic employment energy sources especially waterwheels expanded dark ages addition windmills
machine tools occasioned surge producing tools industrial revolution advocates nanotechnology expect similar surge tools become microscopic size78
functions
classify tools according basic functions

cutting edge tools knife scythe sickle wedgeshaped implements produce shearing force along narrow face ideally edge tool needs harder material else blade become dulled repeated even resilient tools require periodic sharpening process removing deformation wear edge examples cutting tools include gouges drill bits
moving tools move large tiny items many levers give user mechanical advantage examples forceconcentrating tools include hammer moves nail maul moves stake operate applying physical compression surface case screwdriver force rotational called torque contrast anvil concentrates force object hammered preventing moving away struck writing implements deliver fluid surface compression activate cartridge grabbing twisting nuts bolts pliers glove wrench likewise move items kind force
tools enact chemical changes including temperature ignition lighters blowtorches
guiding measuring perception tools include ruler glasses square sensors straightedge theodolite microscope monitor clock phone printer
shaping tools molds jigs trowels
fastening tools welders rivet guns nail guns glue guns
information data manipulation tools computers spreadsheets

tools combinations tools alarmclock example combination measuring tool clock perception tool alarm enables alarmclock tool falls outside categories mentioned
debate whether consider protective gear items tools directly help perform work protect worker like ordinary clothing meet general definition tools many cases necessary completion work personal protective equipment includes items gloves safety glasses defenders biohazard suits

tool substitution
often design coincidence tool share functional attributes tools case tools substitute tools either makeshift solution matter practical efficiency tool motto importance workers cannot practically carry every specialized tool location every work task carpenter necessarily work shop needs jobs customers house tool substitution divided broadly classes substitution bydesign multipurpose substitution makeshift substitution bydesign would tools designed specifically accomplish multiple tasks using tool
substitution makeshift human ingenuity comes play tool used unintended purpose mechanic using long screw driver separate cars control ball joint instead using tuning fork many cases designed secondary functions tools widely known example former many woodcutting hand saws integrate carpenters square incorporating specially shaped handle allows angles marked aligning appropriate part handle edge scribing along back edge latter illustrated saying tools used hammers nearly tools used function hammer even though tools intentionally designed even fewer work well original
tools also often used substitute many mechanical apparatuses especially older mechanical devices many cases cheap tool could used occupy place missing mechanical part window roller could easily replaced pair visegrips regular pliers transmission shifter ignition switch would able replaced screwdriver would considered tools used unintended purposes substitution makeshift tools rotary tool would considered substitution bydesign multipurpose class tools allows tool least different capabilities multipurpose tools basically multiple tools devicetool tools often power tools come many different attachments like rotary tool could power drill multipurpose tool thing power drill
multiuse tools




bicycle multitool


multitool hand tool incorporates several tools single portable device swiss army knife represents earliest examples tools primary purpose also incorporate functionality example linemans pliers incorporate gripper cutter often used hammer hand saws incorporate carpenters square rightangle blades dull edge saws handle would also category multipurpose tools since also multiple tools multiuse multipurpose used interchangeably types tools specifically made catch many different craftsman traveled work workers types tools revolutionary tool device could several different things revolution tools traveling craftsman would carry many tools sites space would limited vehicle driving problem deal many different tools solved overtaking multiuse tools
animals




bonobo diego fishing termites


main article tool animals
observation confirmed number species tools including monkeys apes elephants several birds otters philosophers originally thought humans ability make tools zoologists observed birds12 monkeys131415 making tools unique relationship humans tools considered species uses tools make tools16
tool metaphors
telephone communication tool interfaces people engaged conversation level also interfaces user communication network another level domain media communications technology counterintuitive aspect relationships tools first began gain popular recognition marshall mcluhan famously said shape tools tools shape mcluhan referring fact social practices coevolve tools refinements make existing tools
