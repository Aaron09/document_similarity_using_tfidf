behavioredit
norms running counter behaviors overarching society culture transmitted maintained within small subgroups society example crandall 1988 noted certain groups cheerleading squads dance troupes sports teams sororities rate bulimia publicly recognized lifethreatening disease much higher society whole social norms maintaining order organizing groups11
social controledit
although considered formal laws within society norms still work promote great deal social control12 statements regulate conduct cultural phenomenon norm prescriber acceptable behavior specific instances ranging variations depending culture race religion geographical location foundation terms know acceptable injure others golden rule keep promises pledged13 without would world without consensus common ground restrictions even though states legislation intended control social norms society inherently linked dictates said language used legislation controlling dictating accepted example criminalisation familial sexual relations said protect vulnerable however even consenting adults cannot sexual relationships relatives language surrounding laws conveys message acts supposedly immoral condemned even though actual victim consenting relationships14
social norms enforced formally sanctions informally body language nonverbal communication cues individuals often derive physical psychological resources group membership groups said control discretionary stimuli groups withhold give resources response members adherence group norms effectively controlling member behavior rewards operant conditioning15 social psychology research found individual values groupcontrolled resources individual sees group membership central definition self likely conform15 social norms also allow individual assess behaviors group deems important existence survival since represent codification belief groups generally punish members create norms actions care little about1516 norms every culture create conformity allows people become socialized culture live1
social beings individuals learn appropriate certain things certain words discuss certain topics wear certain clothes thus knowledge cultural norms important impressions17 individuals regulation nonverbal behavior also comes know experience types people heshe cannot discuss certain topics wear certain types dress around typically knowledge derived experience social norms learned social interaction17 wearing suit interview order give great first impression represents common example social norm white collar work force
sociologyedit
talcott parsons functionalist school norms dictate interactions people social encounters hand karl marx believed norms used promote creation roles society allows people different levels social class structure able function properly1 marx claims power dynamic creates social order
heinrich popitz convinced establishment social norms make future actions alter foreseeable solves problem contingency niklas luhmann count actions would already performed wait actual execution social interaction thus accelerated important factors standardization behavior sanctions18 social roles
emergence transmissionedit
rulemaking basic impulses humans organizing simplifying actions everyday rules place well rules structured whether group individual humans make rules strive finding rules come world works19 rules accepted individual group trial error become norm
groups adopt norms variety ways norms arise formally groups explicitly outline implement behavioral expectations laws club rules serve example this20 large number norms follow naturally driving right side road left side speeding order avoid ticket many formal norms serve provide safety general public
however social norms much likely develop informally emerging gradually result repeated discretionary stimuli control behavior1521 necessarily laws writing informal norms represent generally accepted widely sanctioned routines people follow everyday life22 informal norms broken invite formal legal punishments sanctions instead encourage reprimands warnings othering incest example generally thought wrong society many jurisdictions legally prohibit
transfer norms groupsedit
individuals also import norms previous organization group adopted time1623 without clear indication people typically rely past history determine best course forward successful serve well group individuals import different histories scripts appropriate behaviors common experience time lead group define whole take right action usually integration several members schemas23 importation paradigm norm formation occurs subtly swiftly23 whereas formal informal development norms take longer
groups internalize norms accepting reasonable proper standards behaviour within group firmly established norm becomes part groups operational structure hence difficult change possible newcomers group change norms much likely individual adopt groups norms values perspectives rather around15
deviance social normsedit




normal word graffito ljubljana slovenia


deviance defined nonconformity norms accepted significant number people community society24 simply group members follow norm become labeled deviant sociological literature often lead considered outcasts society deviant behavior amongst children somewhat expected except idea deviance manifesting criminal action social tolerance given example child quickly withdrawn criminal crime considered extreme forms deviancy according scholar clifford shaw25 considered normal relative location culture social interaction taking place psychology individual routinely disobeys group norms runs risk turning institutionalized deviant similar sociological definition institutionalized deviants judged group members failure adhere norms first group members increase pressure nonconformist attempting engage individual conversation explicate follow behavioral expectations role decides whether behave largely determined actions effect others26 especially members perhaps know better groups discretionary stimuli bring individuals behavior back line time however member continues disobey group give lost cause group necessarily revoke membership give superficial consideration15 worker late meeting example violating office norm punctuality boss coworker wait individual arrive pull aside later happened behavior continues eventually group begin meetings without since individual always late group generalizes individuals disobedience promptly dismisses thereby reducing members influence footing future group disagreements
group tolerance deviation varies across membership group members receive treatment norm violations individuals build reserve good behavior conformity borrow later idiosyncrasy credits provide theoretical currency understanding variations group behavioral expectations27 teacher example easily forgive straighta student misbehaving—who past good credit saved up—than repeatedly disruptive student past performance help build idiosyncrasy credits group members higher balance start with27 individuals import idiosyncrasy credits another group childhood movie stars example enroll college experience leeway adopting school norms incoming freshmen finally leaders individuals highstatus positions begin credits appear rules times1527 even idiosyncrasy credits bottomless however held lenient standard average member leaders still face group rejection disobedience becomes extreme
deviance also causes multiple emotions experiences going norm emotions widely attributed guilt emotion connected ethics duty turn becomes primary object moral obligation guilt followed action questioned doing28 described something negative self well negative state feeling used instances unpleasant feeling well form selfpunishment using metaphor dirty hands29 staining tainting oneself therefore self cleanse away filth form reparation confronts oneself well submitting possibility anger punishment others guilt point action feeling acts stimulus honorable actions
operant conditioningedit
probability actions committed coined skinner states operant conditioning plays role process social norm operant conditioning increase action occur increasing reinforced response process reward punishment trial error hand hand deviance consequences one’s behavior whether positive negative determine probability reoccurrence well push towards regulating one’s decisions future containing five categories conditioning treatment influence actions commits feelings experiences afterwards case social deviance individual gone norm feel negative connotation comes defying conditioning taught therefore indicating negative reinforcement perfect example little girl painting wall house seeks mother’s approval artistic work child witnesses mother putting time realizes paint wall lead punishment therefore causing notice negative reinforcement makes probability painting wall decrease immensely also states humans conditioned young behave around considering outside influences society location in30 built blend ambiance attitude around deviance frowned upon action
focus theory normative conductedit
cialdini reno kallgren developed focus theory normative conduct describe individuals implicitly juggle multiple behavioral expectations expanding conflicting prior beliefs whether cultural situational personal norms motivate action researchers suggested focus individual’s attention dictate behavioral expectation follow31

descriptive versus injunctiveedit
descriptive norms depict happens injunctive norms describe happen cialdini reno kallgren 1990 define descriptive norm peoples perceptions commonly done specific situations signifies people without assigning judgment absence trash ground parking example transmits descriptive norm people litter3132 injunctive norm hand transmits group approval particular behavior dictates individual behave31323334 watching another person pick trash ground throw group member pick injunctive norm ought litter
prescriptive proscriptiveedit
prescriptive norms unwritten rules understood followed society indicate do35 expressing gratitude writing thank card someone gives gift represents prescriptive norm american culture proscriptive norms contrast comprise spectrum similarly societys unwritten rules do35 norms vary cultures acceptable greeting european countries kissing stranger cheek constitutes proscriptive norm united states
subjectiveedit
subjective norm determined beliefs extent important others want perform behavior social influences conceptualized terms pressure people perceive important others perform perform behavior34
mathematical representationsedit
last decades several theorists attempted explain social norms theoretical point view quantifying behavioral expectations graphically attempting plot logic behind adherence theorists hoped able predict whether individuals would conform return potential model game theory provide slightly economic conceptualization norms suggesting individuals calculate cost benefit behind possible behavioral outcomes theoretical frameworks choosing obey violate norms becomes deliberate quantifiable decision
return potential modeledit




figure return potential model reproduced jackson 1965


developed 1960s return potential model provides method plotting visualizing group norms regular coordinate plane amount behavior exhibited plotted xaxis label figure amount group acceptance approval gets plotted yaxis figure graph represents potential return positive outcome individual given behavioral norm theoretically could plot point increment behavior much group likes dislikes action example case among firstyear graduate students strong social norms around many daily cups coffee drink exist return curve figure correctly displays example social norm someone drinks cups coffee group strongly disapproves group approve member behavior someone hits four cups coffee graduate students represented return curve find excessive drink seven cups however approval dips zero exhibited coffee example return potential model displays increment behavior much group approval anticipate

point maximum return point greatest ycoordinate called point maximum return represents amount behavior group likes best2 figure labeling return curve general highlighted point represents point maximum return extending example point maximum return firstyear graduate students would cups coffee receive social approval drinking exactly many cups fewer cups would decrease approval


range tolerable behavior label represents range tolerable behavior amount action group finds acceptable2 encompasses positive area curve figure range tolerable behavior extends group approves behavior carrying coffee example firstyears approve limited number cups coffee cups fewer would fall outside range tolerable behavior norms narrower wider range tolerable behavior typically narrower range behavior indicates behavior greater consequences group15


intensity intensity norm tells much group cares norm much group affect stake lost represented return potential model total amount area subsumed curve regardless whether area positive negative2 norm intensity would vary xaxis amount approval disapproval given behaviors would closer zero highintensity norm however would extreme approval ratings figure intensity norm appears high behaviors invoke rating indifference


crystallization finally norm crystallization refers much variance exists within curve translated theoretical back actual norm shows much agreement exists group members approval given amount behavior2 members believe norm central group functioning others group norm like many cups coffee first years drink would probably crystallization since individuals varying beliefs appropriate amount caffeine imbibe contrast norm plagiarizing another students work would likely high crystallization people uniformly agree behaviors unacceptability showing overall group norm return potential model figure indicate crystallization however return potential model plotted individual data points alongside cumulative norm could demonstrate variance allow deduce crystallization
