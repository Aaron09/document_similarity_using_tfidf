coastlines volatile habitats


also coast coastal biogeomorphology coastal fish
marine coasts dynamic environments constantly change like ocean partially shape earths natural processes including weather level change result erosion accretion resculpturing coasts well flooding creation continental shelves drowned river valleys
main agents responsible deposition erosion along coastlines waves tides currents formation coasts also depends nature rocks made harder rocks less likely erode variations rock hardness result coastlines different shapes
tides often determine range sediment deposited eroded areas high tidal ranges allow waves reach farther shore areas lower tidal ranges produce deposition smaller elevation interval tidal range influenced size shape coastline tides typically cause erosion however tidal bores erode waves surge river estuaries ocean19
waves erode coastline break shore releasing energy larger wave energy releases sediment moves sediment deposited waves comes eroded cliff faces moved along coastline waves sediment deposited rivers dominant influence amount sediment located coastline20



shores look permanent short perceptive human lifetime fact among temporary marine structures21



sedimentologist francis shepard classified coasts primary secondary22

primary coasts shaped nonmarine processes changes land form coast much condition level stabilised last called primary coast22 primary coasts created erosion wearing away soil rock deposition buildup sediment sand tectonic activity changes structure rock soil earthquakes many coastlines formed level rose last 18000 years submerging river glacial valleys form bays fjords23 example primary coast river delta forms river deposits soil material enters sea23
secondary coasts produced marine processes action creatures live secondary coastlines include cliffs barrier islands flats coral reefs mangrove swamps salt marshes23





global continental shelf highlighted cyan defines extent coastal habitats occupies total world area



continental coastlines usually continental shelf shelf relatively shallow water less metres deep extends average beyond coast worldwide continental shelves occupy total area million million oceans total area nearly worlds total area2425 since continental shelf usually less metres deep follows coastal habitats generally photic situated sunlit epipelagic zone means conditions photosynthetic processes important primary production available coastal marine habitats land nearby large discharges nutrient rich land runoff coastal waters periodic upwellings deep ocean provide cool nutrient rich currents along edge continental shelf
result coastal marine life abundant world found tidal pools fjords estuaries near sandy shores rocky coastlines around coral reefs continental shelf coastal fish include small forage fish well larger predator fish feed forage fish thrive inshore waters high productivity results upwelling shoreline nutrients partial residents spawn streams estuaries bays complete life cycle zone26 also mutualism species occupy adjacent marine habitats example fringing reefs tide level mutually beneficial relationship mangrove forests high tide level grass meadows reefs protect mangroves seagrass strong currents waves would damage erode sediments rooted mangroves seagrass protect coral large influxes silt fresh water pollutants additional level variety environment beneficial many types coral reef animals example feed grass reefs protection breeding27

waves currents shape intertidal shoreline eroding softer rocks transporting grading loose particles shingles sand


intertidaledit
intertidal zones areas close shore constantly exposed covered oceans tides huge array life lives within zone
shore habitats range upper intertidal zones area land vegetation takes prominence underwater anywhere daily infrequently many species scavengers living life washed shore many land animals also make much shore intertidal habitats subgroup organisms habitat bores grinds exposed rock process bioerosion
sandy shoresedit




sandy shores provide shifting homes many species


also beach
sandy shores also called beaches coastal shorelines sand accumulates waves currents shift sand continually building eroding shoreline longshore currents flow parallel beaches making waves break obliquely sand currents transport large amounts sand along coasts forming spits barrier islands tombolos longshore currents also commonly create offshore bars give beaches stability reducing erosion28
sandy shores full life grains sand host diatoms bacteria microscopic creatures fish turtles return certain beaches spawn eggs sand birds habitat beaches like gulls loons sandpipers terns pelicans aquatic mammals lions recuperate clams periwinkles crabs shrimp starfish urchins found beaches29
sand sediment made small grains particles diameters mm30 mudflats sediment made particles finer sand small particle size means particles tend stick together whereas sand particles easily shifted waves currents dries cakes solid contrast sand easily shifted waves currents sand dries blown wind accumulating shifting sand dunes beyond high tide mark beach lowlying wind form rolling hills sand dunes small dunes shift reshape influence wind larger dunes stabilise sand vegetation28
ocean processes grade loose sediments particle sizes sand gravel cobbles waves breaking beach leave berm raised ridge coarser pebbles sand high tide mark shingle beaches made particles larger sand cobbles small stones beaches make poor habitats little life survives stones churned pounded together waves currents28
rocky shoresedit




tidepools rocky shores make turbulent habitats many forms marine life


also rocky shore tidal pool
relative solidity rocky shores seems give permanence compared shifting nature sandy shores apparent stability real even quite short geological time scales real enough short life organism contrast sandy shores plants animals anchor rocks31
competition develop rocky spaces example barnacles compete successfully open intertidal rock faces point rock surface covered barnacles resist desiccation grip well exposed rock faces however crevices rocks inhabitants different mussels successful species secured rock byssal threads31
rocky sandy coasts vulnerable humans find attractive want live near increasing proportion humans live coast putting pressure coastal habitats31

mudflatsedit




mudflats become temporary habitats migrating birds


also
mudflats coastal wetlands form deposited tides rivers found sheltered areas bays bayous lagoons estuaries mudflats viewed geologically exposed layers resulting deposition estuarine silts clays marine animal detritus sediment within mudflat within intertidal zone thus flat submerged exposed approximately twice daily
mudflats typically important regions wildlife supporting large population although levels biodiversity particularly high particular importance migratory birds united kingdom mudflats classified biodiversity action plan priority habitat

estuary partly enclosed coastal body water rivers streams flowing free connection open sea35 estuaries form transition zone river environments ocean environments subject marine influences tides waves influx saline water riverine influences flows fresh water sediment inflow seawater freshwater provide high levels nutrients water column sediment making estuaries among productive natural habitats world36
estuaries formed flooding rivereroded glacially scoured valleys level began rise 1000012000 years ago37 amongst heavily populated areas throughout world world’s population living along estuaries coast result estuaries suffering degradation many factors including sedimentation soil erosion deforestation overgrazing poor farming practices overfishing drainage filling wetlands eutrophication excessive nutrients sewage animal wastes pollutants including heavy metals pcbs radionuclides hydrocarbons sewage inputs diking damming flood control water diversion37
estuaries provide habitats large number organisms support high productivity estuaries provide habitats salmon trout nurseries38 well migratory bird populations39 main characteristics estuarine life variability salinity sedimentation many species fish invertebrates various methods control conform shifts salt concentrations termed osmoconformers osmoregulators many animals also burrow avoid predation live stable sedimental environment however large numbers bacteria found within sediment high oxygen demand reduces levels oxygen within sediment often resulting partially anoxic conditions exacerbated limited water flux phytoplankton primary producers estuaries move water bodies flushed tides productivity largely dependent turbidity water main phytoplankton present diatoms dinoflagellates abundant sediment
kelp forestsedit




kelp forests provide habitat many marine organisms


kelp forests underwater areas high density kelp form productive dynamic ecosystems earth40 smaller areas anchored kelp called kelp beds kelp forests occur worldwide throughout temperate polar coastal oceans40
kelp forests provide unique threedimensional habitat marine organisms source understanding many ecological processes last century focus extensive research particularly trophic ecology continue provoke important ideas relevant beyond unique ecosystem example kelp forests influence coastal oceanographic patterns41 provide many ecosystem services42
however humans contributed kelp forest degradation particular concern effects overfishing nearshore ecosystems release herbivores normal population regulation result overgrazing kelp algae43 rapidly result transitions barren landscapes relatively species persist44
frequently considered ecosystem engineer kelp provides physical substrate habitat kelp forest communities45 algae kingdom protista body individual organism known thallus rather plant kingdom plantae morphological structure kelp thallus defined three basic structural units44



holdfast rootlike mass anchors thallus floor though unlike true roots responsible absorbing delivering nutrients rest thallus
stipe analogous plant stalk extending vertically holdfast providing support framework morphological features
fronds leaf bladelike attachments extending stipe sometimes along full length sites nutrient uptake photosynthetic activity



addition many kelp species pneumatocysts gasfilled bladders usually located base fronds near stipe structures provide necessary buoyancy kelp maintain upright position water column
environmental factors necessary kelp survive include hard substrate usually rock high nutrients nitrogen phosphorus light minimum annual irradiance dose m−246 especially productive kelp forests tend associated areas significant oceanographic upwelling process delivers cool nutrientrich water depth ocean’s mixed surface layer46 water flow turbulence facilitate nutrient assimilation across kelp fronds throughout water column47 water clarity affects depth sufficient light transmitted ideal conditions giant kelp macrocystis grow much 3060 centimetres vertically species nereocystis annual others like eisenia perennial living years48 perennial kelp forests maximum growth rates occur upwelling months typically spring summer diebacks correspond reduced nutrient availability shorter photoperiods increased storm frequency44
