parmenides among first greek tradition propose ontological characterization fundamental nature existence prologue proem describes views existence initially nothing comes nothing therefore existence eternal consequently opinions truth must often false deceitful western philosophy including fundamental concepts falsifiability emerged view posits existence conceived thought created possessed hence neither void vacuum true reality neither come vanish existence rather entirety creation eternal uniform immutable though infinite characterized shape perfect sphere parmenides thus posits change perceived everyday experience illusory everything apprehended part single entity idea somewhat anticipates modern concept ultimate grand unification theory finally describes existence terms interrelated subatomic reality applies everythingcitation needed
ontological pluralismedit
main article ontological pluralism
opposite eleatic monism pluralistic conception century anaxagoras leucippus replaced10 reality unique unchanging becoming therefore fundamental elementary ontic plurality thesis originated hellenic world stated different ways anaxagoras leucippus first theory dealt seeds aristotle referred homeomeries various substances second atomistic theory11 dealt reality based vacuum atoms intrinsic movement itcitation needed

platoedit
plato developed distinction true reality illusion arguing real eternal unchanging forms ideas precursor universals things experienced sensation best merely copies real copy partake forms general plato presumes nouns beauty refer real entities whether sensible bodies insensible forms hence sophist plato argues form existent things participate common though unclear whether intended sense existence copula identity argues parmenides forms must exist also negation nonbeing differencecitation needed
categories aristotle identifies possible kinds things subject predicate proposition aristotle four different ontological dimensionscitation needed

according various categories ways addressing
according truth falsity fake gold counterfeit money

according avicenna interpretation greek aristotelian platonist ontological doctrines medieval metaphysics either necessary contingent possible impossible necessary cannot since nonbeing entails contradiction contingent possible neither necessary impossible ontologically neutral brought potential existing actual existence cause external essence borrowed unlike necessary existent selfsubsisting impossible impossible necessarily exist affirmation contradiction14

ontological epistemological certaintyedit
rené descartes pense donc suis cogito ergo think therefore argued self something know exists epistemological certainty descartes argued knowledge could lead proof certainty existence using ontological argument formulated first anselm canterburycitation needed
certainty existence self however came increasing criticism 20th century sociological theorists notably george herbert mead erving goffman cartesian generalized imaginary audience individuals thinking self according mead assume self begin self presupposed stuff world arises rather self arises world1617 cartesian also used sigmund freud superego abstract regulatory force émile durkheim viewed psychologically manifested entity represented society largecitation needed
body environment questioning meaning beingedit
schools subjectivism objectivism relativism existed various times 20th century postmodernists body philosophers tried reframe questions terms bodies taking specific action environment relied great degree insights derived scientific research animals taking instinctive action natural artificial settings—as studied biology ecology18 cognitive sciencecitation needed
processes bodies related environments became great concern idea became difficult really define people mean said must linguists advocated dropping verb english language leaving prime supposedly less prone abstractions others mostly philosophers tried word usage martin heidegger distinguished human existence things world heidegger proposes human world cast historically fundamental ontological questioning fundamental ontological categories provide basis communication horizon unspoken seemingly unquestionable background meanings human beings understood unquestioningly subjects entities understood unquestioningly objects basic ontological meanings generate regenerated everyday interactions locus historical epoch communicative event language use16 heidegger however communication first place among human beings language shapes response questioning inexhaustible meaning being19 even focus traditional ontology whatness quidditas beings substantial standing presence shifted pose question whoness human itself20
ontology languageedit
philosophers suggest question least part issue usage rather question facts21 perspective conveyed analogy made donald davidson suppose person refers chair makes comments pertinent uses word chair consistently throughout instead might readily catch person simply calls chair oddity explained22 analogously find people asserting suchandsuch think suchandsuch exist might conclude people nuts davidson calls assumption charity simply differently question least partially topic philosophy language entirely ontology itself23 viewpoint expressed hirsch2425
hirsch interprets hilary putnam asserting different concepts existence something correct25 position contradict view things exist points different languages different rules assigning property2526 determine fitness language world becomes subject investigation
common indoeuropean copula languages double verb stating entity exists well stating property sometimes argued third also distinct stating member class language families roles completely different verbs less likely confused another example might something like redness rather hence discussion indoeuropean language philosophy need make distinctions sensescitation needed

reality actualityedit
according whitehead ontology useful distinguish terms reality actuality view actual entity philosophical status fundamental ontological priority real entity actual derive reality logical relation actual entity entities example occasion life socrates actual entity socrates make actual entity refers indeterminately many actual entities several occasions life socrates also several occasions lives alcibiades others notion real derives reality reference many actual occasions actual entity actual occasion concrete entity terms abstractions many concrete relevant entities
according whitehead actual entity must earn philosophical status fundamental ontological priority satisfying several philosophical criteria follows

going behind actual entity find something fundamental fact efficacy criterion regarded expressing axiom postulated distinguished doctrine
actual entity must completely determinate sense confusion identity would allow confounded another actual entity sense actual entity completely concrete potential something course source potentiality creation actual entities said part cause likewise concretion realization potentialities actual entities partial causes
