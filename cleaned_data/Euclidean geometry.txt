axiomsedit




parallel postulate postulate lines intersect third inner angles side less right angles lines inevitably must intersect side extended enough


euclidean geometry axiomatic system theorems true statements derived small number axioms5 near beginning first book elements euclid gives five postulates axioms plane geometry stated terms constructions translated thomas heath6
following postulated

draw straight line point point
produce extend finite straight line continuously straight line
describe circle centre distance radius
right angles equal another
parallel postulate straight line falling straight lines make interior angles side less right angles straight lines produced indefinitely meet side angles less right angles

although euclids statement postulates explicitly asserts existence constructions also taken unique
elements also include following five common notions

things equal thing also equal another formally euclidean property equality considered consequence transitivity property equality
equals added equals wholes equal addition property equality
equals subtracted equals remainders equal subtraction property equality
things coincide another equal another reflexive property
whole greater part

parallel postulateedit
main article parallel postulate
ancients parallel postulate seemed less obvious others concerned creating system absolutely rigorous seemed parallel line postulate able proven rather simply accepted fact known proof impossible7 euclid seems considered qualitatively different others evidenced organization elements first propositions presents proved without
many alternative axioms formulated logical consequences parallel postulate example playfairs axiom states

plane point given straight line line drawn never meets given line





proof euclids elements given line segment equilateral triangle exists includes segment sides proof construction equilateral triangle made drawing circles centered points taking intersection circles third vertex triangle


methods proofedit
euclidean geometry constructive postulates assert existence uniqueness certain geometric figures assertions constructive nature told certain things exist also given methods creating compass unmarked straightedge8 sense euclidean geometry concrete many modern axiomatic systems theory often assert existence objects without saying construct even assert existence objects cannot constructed within theory9 strictly speaking lines paper models objects defined within formal system rather instances objects example euclidean straight line width real drawn line though nearly modern mathematicians consider nonconstructive methods sound constructive ones euclids constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones—eg pythagoreans proofs involved irrational numbers usually required statement find greatest common measure
euclid often used proof contradiction euclidean geometry also allows method superposition figure transferred another point space example proposition sideangleside congruence triangles proved moving triangles sides coincides triangles equal side proving sides coincide well modern treatments sixth postulate rigidity triangle used alternative superposition11
system measurement arithmeticedit
euclidean geometry fundamental types measurements angle distance angle scale absolute euclid uses right angle basic unit 45degree angle would referred half right angle distance scale relative arbitrarily picks line segment certain nonzero length unit distances expressed relation addition distances represented construction line segment copied onto another line segment extend length similarly subtraction
measurements area volume derived distances example rectangle width length area represents product geometrical interpretation multiplication limited three dimensions direct interpreting product four numbers euclid avoided products although implied proof book proposition




example congruence figures left congruent third similar last figure neither congruences alter properties location orientation leave others unchanged like distance angles latter sort properties called invariants studying essence geometry


euclid refers pair lines pair planar solid figures equal ἴσος lengths areas volumes equal similarly angles stronger term congruent refers idea entire figure size shape another figure alternatively figures congruent moved matches exactly flipping allowed thus example rectangle rectangle equal congruent letter congruent mirror image figures would congruent except differing sizes referred similar corresponding angles pair similar shapes congruent corresponding sides proportion
notation terminologyedit
naming points figuresedit
points customarily named using capital letters alphabet figures lines triangles circles named listing sufficient number points pick unambiguously relevant figure triangle would typically triangle vertices points
complementary supplementary anglesedit
angles whose right angle called complementary complementary angles formed shares vertex pointed direction original rays form right angle number rays original rays infinite
angles whose straight angle supplementary supplementary angles formed shares vertex pointed direction original rays form straight angle degree angle number rays original rays infinite
modern versions euclids notationedit
modern terminology angles would normally measured degrees radians
modern school textbooks often define separate figures called lines infinite rays semiinfinite line segments finite length euclid rather discussing object extends infinity direction would normally locutions line extended sufficient length although occasionally referred infinite lines line euclid could either straight curved used specific term straight line necessary

congruence trianglesedit




congruence triangles determined specifying sides angle angles side angles corresponding adjacent side specifying sides adjacent angle however yield distinct possible triangles unless angle specified right angle


triangles congruent three sides equal sides angle equal angles side equal book propositions triangles three equal angles similar necessarily congruent also triangles equal sides adjacent angle necessarily equal congruent
