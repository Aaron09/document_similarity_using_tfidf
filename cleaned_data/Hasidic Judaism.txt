main article hasidic philosophy
distinctionsedit
lengthy history hasidism numerous schools thought therein particularly traditional medium homiletic literature sermons comprising numerous references earlier sources pentateuch talmud exegesis means grounding oneself tradition almost sole channel convey ideas made isolation common doctrine highly challenging researchers noted joseph every attempt present body ideas failed even motifs presented scholars past unique hasidic contributions later revealed common among predecessors opponents regarding many traits widely extant play added prominent role modern nonhasidic antihasidic writings well3 difficulty separating movements philosophy main inspiration lurianic kabbalah determining novel merely recapitulation also baffled historians like louis jacobs regarded early masters innovators introduced much emphasis4 others primarily mendel piekarz argued contrary little found much earlier tracts movements originality manner popularized teachings become ideology wellorganized sect5
among traits particularly associated hasidism common understanding fact widespread importance happiness worship religious life though sect undoubtedly stressed aspect still possesses clear populist bent another example value placed simple ordinary supposed contradiction favouring elitist scholars beforehand ideas common ethical works preceding hasidism movement decades challenge rabbinic establishment relied authority torah acumen affirmed centrality study soon concurrently image opponents dreary intellectuals lacked spiritual fervour opposed mysticism likewise unfounded neither hasidism often portrayed promoting healthy sensuality unanimously reject asceticism selfmortification associated primarily rivals joseph ascribed perceptions socalled neohasidic writers thinkers like martin buber attempt build models spirituality modern jews propagated romantic sentimental image movement neohasidic interpretation influenced even scholarly discourse great degree tenuous connection reality3
complication divide researchers term early hasidism ended early 1800s established hasidism since onwards former highly dynamic religious revival movement latter phase characterized consolidation sects hereditary leadership mystical teachings formulated first means repudiated many hasidic masters remained consummate spiritualists original thinkers noted benjamin brown bubers commonly accepted view routinization constituted decadence refuted later studies demonstrating movement remained much innovative6 many aspects early hasidism indeed deemphasized favour conventional religious expressions radical concepts largely neutralized rebbes adopted relatively rationalist bent sidelining explicit mystical theurgical roles many others functioned almost solely political leaders large communities hasidim affiliation less matter admiring charismatic leader early days rather birth family belonging specific court7
immanenceedit
fundamental theme underlying hasidic theory immanence universe often expressed phrase tikunei hazohar leit atar panuy minéya aramaic site devoid panentheistic concept derived lurianic discourse greatly expanded hasidic beginning order create world contracted tzimtzum omnipresence leaving vacant void khalal panui bereft obvious presence therefore able entertain free contradictions phenomena seemingly separate would impossible within original perfect existence reality world created void entirely dependent divine origin matter would null void without true spiritual essence possesses infinite cannot manifest vacant void must limit guise measurable corporeality perceived8
thus dualism true aspect everything physical side false ineluctable evolving must compress disguise must humans matter general ascend reunite omnipresence rachel elior quoted shneur zalman liadi commentary torah genesis 2821 wrote purpose creation infinity finitude reversed state finite infinity kabbalah stressed importance dialectic mainly though exclusively evoked cosmic terms referring example manner progressively diminished world various dimensions sephirot hasidism applied also mundane details human existence hasidic schools devoted prominent place teaching differing accentuation interchanging nature infinite imperceptible becoming yesh existent vice versa used concept prism gauge world needs spirit particular elior noted reality lost static nature permanent value measured standard seeking expose godly boundless essence manifest tangible circumscribed opposite9
major derivative philosophy notion devekut communion everywhere connection pursued ceaselessly well times places occasions experience reach every person negate inferior impulses grasp truth divine immanence enabling unite attain state perfect selfless bliss hasidic masters well versed teachings concerning communion supposed gain guide flock devekut strictly defined experience many varieties described utmost ecstasy learned leaders common mans humble less significant emotion prayer
closely linked former bitul hayesh negation existent corporeal hasidism teaches superficial observance universe eyes flesh einei habasar purportedly reflects reality things profane worldly true devotee must transcend illusory façade realize nothing matter perception practical entails also abandoning material concerns cleaving true spiritual ones oblivious surrounding false distractions life practitioners success detaching sense person conceive double meaning naught infinite regarded highest state elation hasidism true divine essence soul ascend return upper realm possess existence independent ideal termed hitpashtut hagashmiyut expansion removal corporeality dialectic opposite gods contraction world10
enlightened capable bitul hayesh pursuing pure spiritual aims defying primitive impulses body must overcome inferior bestial soul connected eyes flesh able divine soul nefesh elohit craves communion employing constant contemplation hitbonenot hidden godly dimension exists could understand surroundings eyes intellect ideal adherent intended develop equanimity hishtavut hasidic parlance toward matters worldly ignoring understanding superficiality
hasidic masters exhorted followers negate paying little heed could worldly concerns thus clear transformation struggle doubt torn belief gods immanence real sensual experience indifferent world theme movements literature many tracts devoted subject acknowledging callous rude flesh hinders holding fast ideal shortcomings extremely hard overcome even purely intellectual level fortiori actual life11
another implication dualism notion worship corporeality avodah begashmiyut metamorphosed substance turn raised back higher state likewise since machinations higher sephirot exert influence world even simple action performed correctly understanding achieve reverse effect according lurianic doctrine netherworld suffused divine sparks concealed within husks qliphoth glints recovered elevated proper place cosmos materiality could embraced consecrated noted glenn dynner hasidism taught common acts like dancing eating performed intention sparks could extricated free avodah begashmiyut clear implicit antinomian edge possibly equating sacred rituals mandated judaism everyday activities granting status believers eyes content commit latter expense former occasions movement appear step direction example early days prayer preparation consumed much time adherents blamed neglecting sufficient torah study hasidic masters proved highly conservative unlike radical sects influenced kabbalistic ideas like sabbateans worship corporeality largely limited elite carefully restrained common adherents taught engage mildly small deeds like earning money support leaders
complementary opposite corporeal worship elation finite infinite concept hamshacha drawing absorbing specifically hamschat hashefa absorption effluence spiritual ascension could siphon power animating higher dimensions material world would manifest benevolent influence kinds included spiritual enlightenment zest worship highminded aims also prosaic health healing deliverance various troubles simple economic prosperity thus tangible alluring motivation become followers emerged corporeal worship absorption allowed masses access common actions religious experience deemed esoteric12
another reflection einyesh dialectic pronounced transformation evil goodness relations poles contradicting elements including various traits emotions human psyche like pride humility purity profanity cetera hasidic thinkers argued order redeem sparks hidden associate merely corporeal evil example elevation impure thoughts prayer transforming noble ones rather repressing advocated mainly early days sect breaking oneselfs character directly confronting profane inclinations aspect sharp antinomian implications used sabbateans justify excessive sinning mostly toned late hasidism even leaders careful stress exercised physical sense contemplative spiritual kabbalistic notion unique movement appeared frequently among jewish groups13

late 17th century several social trends converged among jews inhabited southern periphery polish–lithuanian commonwealth especially contemporary western ukraine enabled emergence flourishing hasidism
