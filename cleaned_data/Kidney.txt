homeostasisedit
kidney participates wholebody homeostasis regulating acidbase balance electrolyte concentrations extracellular fluid volume blood pressure kidney accomplishes homeostatic functions independently concert organs particularly endocrine system various endocrine hormones coordinate endocrine functions include renin angiotensin aldosterone antidiuretic hormone atrial natriuretic peptide among others
kidneys excrete variety waste products produced metabolism urine include nitrogenous wastes urea protein catabolism uric acid nucleic acid metabolism ability mammals birds concentrate wastes volume urine much smaller volume blood wastes extracted dependent elaborate countercurrent multiplication mechanism requires several independent nephron characteristics operate tight hairpin configuration tubules water permeability descending limb loop water impermeability ascending loop active transport ascending limb addition passive countercurrent exchange vessels carrying blood supply nephron essential enabling function
acidbase balanceedit
main article acidbase homeostasis
organ systems kidneys lungs maintain acidbase homeostasis maintenance around relatively stable value lungs contribute acidbase homeostasis regulating carbon dioxide concentration kidneys important roles maintaining acidbase balance reabsorb regenerate bicarbonate urine excrete hydrogen ions fixed acids anions acids urine
regulation osmolalityedit
maintaining water salt level body significant rise plasma osmolality detected hypothalamus communicates directly posterior pituitary gland increase osmolality causes gland secrete antidiuretic hormone resulting water reabsorption kidney increase urine concentration factors work together return plasma osmolality normal levels
binds principal cells collecting duct translocate aquaporins membrane allowing water leave normally impermeable membrane reabsorbed body vasa recta thus increasing plasma volume body
systems create hyperosmotic medulla thus increase body plasma volume urea recycling single effect
urea usually excreted waste product kidneys however plasma blood volume released aquaporins opened also permeable urea allows urea leave collecting duct medulla creating hyperosmotic solution attracts water urea reenter nephron excreted recycled depending whether still present
single effect describes fact ascending thick limb loop henle permeable water permeable sodium chloride allows countercurrent exchange system whereby medulla becomes increasingly concentrated time setting osmotic gradient water follow aquaporins collecting duct opened
blood pressure regulationedit
main articles blood pressure regulation reninangiotensin system
although kidney cannot directly sense blood longterm regulation blood pressure predominantly depends upon kidney primarily occurs maintenance extracellular fluid compartment size depends plasma sodium concentration renin first series important chemical messengers make reninangiotensin system changes renin ultimately alter output system principally hormones angiotensin aldosterone hormone acts multiple mechanisms increase kidneys absorption sodium chloride thereby expanding extracellular fluid compartment raising blood pressure renin levels elevated concentrations angiotensin aldosterone increase leading increased sodium chloride reabsorption expansion extracellular fluid compartment increase blood pressure conversely renin levels angiotensin aldosterone levels decrease contracting extracellular fluid compartment decreasing blood pressure
hormone secretionedit
kidneys secrete variety hormones including erythropoietin enzyme renin erythropoietin released response hypoxia levels oxygen tissue level renal circulation stimulates erythropoiesis production blood cells bone marrow calcitriol activated form vitamin promotes intestinal absorption calcium renal reabsorption phosphate part renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system renin enzyme involved regulation aldosterone levels
