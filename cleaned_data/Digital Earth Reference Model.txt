term digital earth reference model derm coined foresman context vision encompassing geospatial platform abstract information flow support gore’s vision digital earth1 digital earth reference model seeks facilitate promote georeferenced information multiple sources internet2 digital earth reference model defines fixed global reference frame earth using four principles digital system3 namely



discrete partitioning using regular irregular cell mesh tiling grid4
data acquisition using signal processing theory sampling quantizing assigning binary values continuous analog digital sources discrete cell partitions
ordering naming cells provide unique spatial indexing geographic location address
mathematical operations built indexing algebraic geometric boolean image processing transforms

value digital earth reference model encode information earth akin value obtained digital technologies namely synchronization physical domain information domain digital audio digital photography efficiencies found data storage processing integration discovery transmission visualization aggregation analytical fusion modeling transforms data reference digital earth reference model derm becomes ubiquitous facilitating distributed spatial queries “what here” “what changed” image signal processing theory utilized operate data referenced derm
derm structure data independent allowing general quantization georeferenced data sources onto common grid application algorithms operations developed grid independent data sources
approaches using analog reference require rigorous manual conflation satisfy creation digital products digital maps cartographic navigation geospatial information also however digital models weaker geometric transformations translation scaling rotation must conform discrete cell locations wherein analog model continuum locations geometric transformation straight forward requirements reprocessing resampling
cell shape representations critical validity adaptability usefulness grid rectilinear structures intuitive lack optimization characteristics tessellation especially tiled sphere schemes including voronoi regions peano curves triangles hexagonal tilings advanced superior alternatives
many ordering naming models implemented geospatial database indexing efficient data retrieval rtrees models encompassed complete digital earth reference model formation digits represent hierarchy index contains parent child relationship formation digits monotonically converges modulus vector reals
