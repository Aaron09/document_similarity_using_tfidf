legacy productsedit
company historically developed technologies products helped protect content pirated core legacy products called ripguard analog copy protection
ripguardedit
macrovision introduced ripguard technology february 2005 designed prevent reduce digital copying altering format content disrupt ripping software although technology could circumvented several current rippers anydvd dvdfab macrovision claimed casual users lack knowledge andor determination able copy ripguard technology23
analog copy protection acpedit
analog video formats convey video signals series lines lines used constructing visible image shown screen several lines exist convey visual information known vertical blanking interval extra lines historically served purpose contain vertical synchronizing pulses modern implementations used carry convey different things different countries example closed captioning




macrovision pulses otherwise unused video line large forcing vcrs auto contrast circuit make picture darker






couple seconds later pulses reduced amplitude forcing vcrs auto contrast circuit make picture lighter couple seconds later still pulses return original amplitude darkening picture


macrovisions legacy analog copy protection works implanting series excessive voltage pulses within offscreen lines video pulses included physically within preexisting recordings betamax generated upon playback chip players digital cable satellite boxes recorder receiving analog signal featuring pulses would detect display message saying source copyprotected followed aborting recording vcrs turn react excessive voltage pulses compensating automatic gain control circuitry causing recorded picture wildly change brightness rendering annoying watch system effective vcrs made around mid1980s later
later form macrovisions analog copy protection called level introduced multiple 180degree phase inversions analog signals colorburst also known colorstriping technology caused numerous offcolor bands appear within picture
another form analog copy protection known cgmsa added players digital cablesatellite boxes invented macrovision companys products implemented cgmsa consists flag within vertical blanking interval essentially data like closed captioning digital recording devices search present refused record signal earlier technology unlike digital recording equipment however analog vcrs respond cgmsa encoded video would record successfully also presentcitation needed
historically original macrovision technology considered nuisance specialist users could interfere electronic equipment example video signal television vcrs output ruined signal regardless whether recording also occurs tvvcr combo sets apart many recorders mistake mechanical instability worn videotapes macrovision signals refuse make would perfectly legal dubs peoples home movies like widespread problem another factor contributing demand devices defeat macrovision signal also known confuse home theater line doublers devices improving quality video large projection highend television comb filters addition macrovision confuses many upconverters devices convert video signal higher resolution causing shut refuse play macrovision contentcitation needed
also devices called stabilizers video stabilizers enhancers available filter macrovision spikes thereby defeat system principle function lies detecting vertical synchronization signal forcing lines occurring black level removing agcconfusing pulses easily built hobbyists nothing cheap microcontroller together analog multiplexer little circuitry needed individuals less experienced things purchase video stabilizers
discs made copying programs shrink automatically disable macrovision copy protection ease macrovision copy protection measures defeated prompted steadily growing number releases copy protection kind content scramble system macrovision
united states fair interpreted decision betamax sony corp universal city studios dictates consumers fully within legal rights copy videos however legality changed somewhat controversial digital millennium copyright april 2002 manufactured imported without automatic gain control circuitry renders vcrs vulnerable macrovision contained title section 1201k digital millennium copyright however number mostly older models market affected macrovision
october 2001 sale purchase manufacture device commercial purpose disabling macrovision copy protection made illegal section 1201a controversial
june 2005 macrovision sent cease desist letter lightning maker decrypter program allows users back dvds bypassing macrovision later acquired rights software24
june 2005 macrovision sued sima products section 1201 dmca claiming simas video processors provided circumvent macrovisions analog copy protection sima received injunction barring sale device25 parties ultimately settled without judgment legal issues26
