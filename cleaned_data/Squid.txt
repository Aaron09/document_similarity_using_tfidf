evolution




fossil rhomboteuthis lower callovian voultesurrhône france


squid differentiated ancestral molluscs body plan condensed anteroposteriorly extended dorsoventrally foot ancestor modified complex tentacles highly developed sense organs including advanced eyes similar vertebrates
ancestral shell lost internal gladius remaining feathershaped internal structure supports squids mantle serves site muscle attachment made chitinlike material
description




composite diagram illustrating basic squid features ventral aspect


main body mass enclosed mantle swimming along side fins unlike marine organisms main source locomotion species
skin covered chromatophores enable squid change color suit surroundings making practically invisible underside also almost always lighter topside provide camouflage prey predator
body openings mantle cavity contains gills ctenidia openings excretory reproductive systems front mantle cavity lies siphon squid uses locomotion precise propulsion4 form locomotion water sucked mantle cavity expelled siphon fast strong direction siphon changed suit direction travel
inside mantle cavity beyond siphon lies visceral mass covered thin membranous epidermis major internal organs
nervous system
giant axon diameter larger species innervates mantle controls part propulsion system
cephalopods squid exhibit relatively high intelligence among invertebrates example groups humboldt squid hunt cooperatively using active communication cephalopod intelligence
reproductive system




dissected male specimen onykia ingens showing nonerect penis white tubular structure located organs



specimen species exhibiting elongation penis



females hidden view pair white nidamental glands anterior gills also redspotted accessory nidamental glands present organs associated nutrient manufacture shells eggs females also large translucent ovary situated towards posterior visceral mass
males possess organs instead large testis place ovary spermatophoric gland mature males contain spermatophores placed inside females mantle mating
shallowwater species continental shelf epipelagicmesopelagic zones characterised presence hectocotyli specially modified arms used fertilise females eggs5 deepsea squid lack hectocotyli longer penises ancistrocheiridae cranchiinae exceptions5 giant squid genus architeuthis unusual possess large penis modified tips although whether latter used spermatophore transfer uncertain5 penis elongation observed deepwater species onykia ingens erect penis long mantle head arms combined56 deepwater squid greatest known penis length relative body size mobile animals second entire animal kingdom certain sessile barnacles5
digestive system
like cephalopods squid complex digestive systems muscular stomach found roughly midpoint visceral mass bolus moves caecum digestion caecum long white organ found next ovary testis mature squid priority given reproduction stomach caecum often shrivel later life stages finally food goes liver digestive gland found siphon absorption solid waste passed rectum beside rectum allows squid rapidly discharge black mantle cavity




ventral view viscera female chtenopteryx sicula


cardiovascular system
squid three hearts branchial hearts feed gills surrounding larger systemic heart pumps blood around body squid blood contains copperrich protein hemocyanin transporting oxygen faintly greenish hearts surrounded renal sacs main excretory system kidneys difficult identify stretch hearts located posterior side liver systemic heart made three chambers lower ventricle upper auricles
head
head bears eight arms tentacles form muscular hydrostat containing many suckers along edge tentacles grow back severed mature male basal half left ventral tentacle hectocotylised—and ends copulatory rather suckers used sexual intercourse
mouth equipped sharp horny beak mainly made chitin7 crosslinked proteins used kill tear prey manageable pieces beak robust contain minerals unlike teeth jaws many organisms including marine species8 captured whales often indigestible squid beaks stomachs mouth contains radula rough tongue common molluscs except bivalvia
eyes either side head contain hard lens image focused changing position lens camera telescope rather changing shape lens human
squid appear limited hearing9
