folk taxonomyedit
main articles folk taxonomy binomial nomenclature
modern scientific taxonomy described basically renaissance codification folk taxonomic principles10 formal scientific nomenclatural classification systems exemplified biological classification classification systems established purpose scientific classification system anchors organism within nested hierarchy internationally accepted classification categories maintenance system involves formal rules nomenclature periodic international meetings review modern system evolved folk taxonomy prehistory11 folk taxonomy illustrated western tradition horticulture gardening unlike scientific taxonomy folk taxonomies serve many purposes examples horticulture would grouping plants naming groups according properties uses annuals biennials perennials nature life cycle vegetables fruits culinary herbs spices culinary herbs trees shrubs growth habit wild cultivated plants whether managed weeds whether considered nuisance
folk taxonomy generally associated rural indigenous peoples language make sense organise objects around ethnobiology frames interpretation either utilitarianists like bronislaw malinowski maintain names classifications reflect mainly material concerns intellectualists like claude lévistrauss hold spring innate mental processes12 literature ethnobiological classifications reviewed 200613 folk classification defined members language community name categorize plants animals whereas ethnotaxonomy refers hierarchical structure organic content cultural function biological classification ethnobiologists find every society around world14
ethnographic studies naming classification animals plants nonwestern societies revealed general principles indicate prescientific man’s conceptual linguistic method organising biological world hierarchical way15161718 studies indicate urge classify basic human instinct1920



languages natural groups organisms distinguished presentday taxa
groups arranged inclusive groups ethnobiological categories
languages five ethnobiological categories graded inclusiveness
groups ethnobiological categories arranged hierarchically generally mutually exclusive ranks
ranks particular organisms named classified often similar different cultures



levels moving least inclusive



level unique beginner plant animal single allinclusive name rarely used folk taxonomies loosely equivalent original living thing common ancestor
level “life form” tree bird grass fish usually primary lexemes basic linguistic units loosely equivalent phylum major biological division
level generic name pine robin catfish numerous basic building block folk taxonomies frequently referred important psychologically among first learned children names usually associated directly second level group like lifeform names primary lexemes
level specific name white post less equivalent species secondary lexeme generally less frequent generic names
level varietal nameeg baby lima bean butter lima bean



almost cultures objects named using words equivalent kind genus particular kind species10 made words binomial name usually consists noun like salt star adjectival second word helps describe first therefore makes name whole specific example salt film star meaning noun used common name lost forgotten whelk lion shark common name extended words much conveyed organisms appearance special properties sting poison apple giant stinking hogweed hammerhead shark nounadjective binomials like names family surname like simpson another adjectival christian forename name specifies simpson homer simpson seems reasonable assume form scientific names call binomial nomenclature derived simple practical constructing common names latin universal language
keeping utilitarianist view authors maintain ethnotaxonomies resemble complex resemblances neat hierarchy21
