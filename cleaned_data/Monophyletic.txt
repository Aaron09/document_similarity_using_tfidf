cladistics monophyletic group group organisms forms clade consists descendants common ancestor monophyletic groups typically characterised shared derived characteristics synapomorphies distinguish organisms clade organisms arrangement members monophyletic group called monophyly
monophyly contrasted paraphyly polyphyly shown second diagram paraphyletic group consists descendants common ancestor minus monophyletic groups paraphyletic group nearly monophyletic hence prefix para meaning near polyphyletic group characterized convergent features habits scientific interest example nightactive primates fruit trees aquatic insects features polyphyletic group differentiated others inherited common ancestor
definitions taken time accepted cladistics school thought became mainstream 1960s several alternative definitions indeed taxonomists sometimes used terms without defining leading confusion early literature1 confusion persists2
