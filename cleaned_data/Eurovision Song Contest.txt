musical style presentationedit
songs play diverse supranational audience contrasting musical tastes countries want able appeal many people possible gain votes music contest characterised mishmash power ballads ethnic rhythms bubblegum pop121 wellestablished pattern however notably broken 2006 finnish glam metal band lordis victory122 eurovision visual show many performances attempt attract attention voters means music notably elaborate lighting sequences pyrotechnics sometimes leading bizarre onstage theatrics costumes including revealing dress123
political geographical votingedit
contest long accused political bias perception judges televoters allocate points based nations relationship countries rather musical merits songs124 according study eurovision voting patterns certain countries tend form clusters cliques frequently voting way65 another study concludes 2006 voting blocs least occasions crucially affected outcome contest125 hand others argue certain countries allocate disproportionately high points others similar musical tastes cultures speak similar languages126127 therefore likely appreciate others music
example terry wogan united kingdoms wellknown presenter eurovision since 1980 three presenters mentioned name contest proper128 stood ones broadcast 2008 saying voting used songs national prejudices united kingdom good song good singer came joint last dont want presiding another debacle129
