1980s economist peter bauer offered competing definition term third world claimed attachment third world status particular country based stable economic political criteria mostly arbitrary process large diversity countries considered part third world indonesia afghanistan ranged widely economically primitive economically advanced politically nonaligned soviet westernleaning argument could also made parts like third world6
