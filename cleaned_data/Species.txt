historyedit
classical formsedit
main article aristotles biology
biology aristotle used term γένος génos mean kind bird fish εἶδος eidos mean specific form within kind within birds crane eagle crow sparrow terms translated latin genus species though correspond linnean terms thus named today birds class cranes family crows genus kind distinguished attributes instance bird feathers beak wings hardshelled warm blood form distinguished shared members young inheriting variations might parents aristotle believed kinds forms distinct unchanging approach remained influential renaissance1
fixed speciesedit




john believed species breed true change


main article great chain
observers early modern period began develop systems organization living things placed kind animal plant context many early delineation schemes would considered whimsical schemes included consanguinity based colour plants yellow flowers behaviour snakes scorpions certain biting ants john 1686 english naturalist first give biological definition term species follows

surer criterion determining species occurred distinguishing features perpetuate propagation seed thus matter variations occur individuals species spring seed plant accidental variations distinguish species animals likewise differ specifically preserve distinct species permanently species never springs seed another vice versa2





carl linnaeus created binomial system naming species


18th century swedish scientist carl linnaeus classified organisms according shared physical characteristics simply based upon differences3 established idea taxonomic hierarchy classification based upon observable characteristics intended reflect natural relationships45 time however still widely believed organic connection species matter similar appeared view influenced european scholarly religious education held categories life dictated forming aristotelian hierarchy scala naturae great chain however whether supposed fixed scala ladder inherently implied possibility climbing6
species could changeedit
19th century naturalists understood species could change form time history planet provided enough time major changes jeanbaptiste lamarck 1809 zoological philosophy described transmutation species proposing species could change time radical departure aristotelian thinking7
1859 charles darwin alfred russel wallace provided compelling account evolution formation species darwin argued populations evolved individuals natural selection naturally occurring variation among individuals8 required definition species darwin concluded species appear ideas provisionally useful naming groups interacting individuals look term species wrote arbitrarily given sake convenience individuals closely resembling essentially differ word variety given less distinct fluctuating forms term variety comparison mere individual differences also applied arbitrarily convenience sake9

commonly used names kinds organisms often ambiguous could mean domestic felis catus family felidae another problem common names often vary place place puma cougar catamount panther painter mountain lion mean puma concolor various parts america panther also mean jaguar panthera onca latin america leopard panthera pardus africa asia contrast scientific names species chosen unique universal parts used together genus puma specific epithet concolor1011
species descriptionedit




type specimen holotype lacerta plica described linnaeus 1758


main article species description
species given name type specimen described formally scientist paper assigns scientific name name becomes validly published name botany available name zoology paper accepted publication type material provided scientists examine often research collection major museum121314 scientists asked choose names words international code zoological nomenclature appropriate compact euphonious memorable cause offence15
abbreviationsedit
books articles sometimes intentionally identify species fully abbreviation singular standing species pluralis latin multiple species plural place specific name epithet canis commonly occurs authors confident individuals belong particular genus sure exact species belong common paleontology authors also short saying something applies many species within genus scientists mean something applies species within genus genus name without specific name epithet names genera species usually printed italics abbreviations italicised16
identification codesedit
various codes devised provide identifiers species including

national center biotechnology information ncbi employs numeric taxid taxonomy identifier stable unique identifier taxid sapiens 960617
kyoto encyclopedia genes genomes kegg employs three fourletter code limited number organisms code example sapiens simply hsa18
uniprot employs organism mnemonic five alphanumeric characters human sapiens19

lumping splittingedit
main article lumpers splitters
naming particular species including genus higher taxa placed hypothesis evolutionary relationships distinguishability group organisms information comes hand hypothesis confirmed refuted sometimes especially past communication difficult taxonomists working isolation given distinct names individual organisms later identified species named species discovered species older species name usually retained newer species name dropped process called synonymisation colloquially lumping dividing taxon multiple often taxa called splitting taxonomists often referred lumpers splitters colleagues depending personal approach recognising differences commonalities organisms2122

mayrs biological species conceptedit




ernst mayr proposed widely used biological species concept reproductive isolation 1942


main article biological species concept
modern textbooks ernst mayrs 1942 definition known biological species concept also called reproductive isolation concept defines species as23

groups actually potentially interbreeding natural populations reproductively isolated groups23

argued definition natural consequence effect sexual reproduction dynamics natural selection24252627 mayrs definition excludes unusual artificial matings result deliberate human action occur captivity involve animals capable mating normally wild23
species problemedit
main article species problem
difficult define species applies organisms28 debate species delimitation called species problem2329303132 problem already current 1859 darwin wrote origin species

definition satisfied naturalists every naturalist knows vaguely means speaks species generally term includes unknown element distinct creation33

mayrs concept breaks downedit




palaeontologists limited morphological evidence deciding whether fossil lifeforms like inoceramus bivalves formed separate species


simple textbook definition following mayrs concept works well multicelled organisms breaks several situations

organisms reproduce asexually singlecelled organisms parthenogenetic apomictic multicelled organisms3435
scientists know whether morphologically similar groups organisms capable interbreeding case extinct lifeforms palaeontology breeding experiments possible36
hybridisation permits substantial gene flow species37
ring species members adjacent populations interbreed successfully members nonadjacent populations not38

species identification made difficult discordance molecular morphological investigations categorized types morphology multiple lineages morphological convergence cryptic species lineage multiple morphologies phenotypic plasticity multiple lifecycle stages39 addition horizontal gene transfer makes difficult define species40 species definitions assume organism acquires genes parents like daughter organism happens hgt41 strong evidence dissimilar groups prokaryotes least occasionally dissimilar groups eukaryotes40 including crustaceans echinoderms42
evolutionary biologist james mallet concludes

easy tell whether related geographic temporal forms belong different species species gaps verified locally point time forced admit darwins insight correct local reality integrity species greatly reduced large geographic ranges time periods43

aggregates microspeciesedit
main articles species complex microspecies
species concept weakened existence microspecies groups organisms including many plants little genetic variability usually forming species aggregates44 example dandelion taraxacum officinale blackberry rubus fruticosus aggregates many microspecies—perhaps case blackberry dandelion45 complicated hybridisation apomixis polyploidy making gene flow populations difficult determine taxonomy debatable464748 species complexes occur insects heliconius butterflies49 vertebrates hypsiboas treefrogs50 fungi agaric51







blackberries belong hundreds microspecies rubus fruticosus species aggregate









butterfly genus heliconius contains many similar species









hypsiboas calcaratus–fasciatus species complex contains least species treefrog




hybridisationedit
main article hybrid biology
natural hybridisation presents challenge concept reproductively isolated species fertile hybrids permit gene flow populations example carrion crow corvus corone hooded crow corvus cornix appear classified separate species hybridise freely geographical ranges overlap52

hybridisation carrion hooded crows permits gene flow species






carrion crow









hybrid dark belly dark gray nape

ring speciesedit
main article ring species
ring species connected series neighbouring populations sexually interbreed closely sited related populations exist least populations series distantly related interbreed though potential gene flow linked population nonbreeding though genetically connected populations coexist region thus closing ring ring species thus present difficulty species concept relies reproductive isolation53 however ring species best rare proposed examples include herring gulllesser blackbacked gull complex around north pole ensatina eschscholtzii group populations salamanders america greenish warbler asia5455 evidence none form genuine rings56575859







seven species larus gulls interbreed ring around arctic









opposite ends ring herring gull larus argentatus front lesser blackbacked gull larus fuscus









greenish warbler phylloscopus trochiloides









presumed evolution five species greenish warblers around himalayas




attempts definitionedit
biologists taxonomists made many attempts define species beginning morphology moving towards genetics early taxonomists linnaeus option describe later formalised typological morphological species concept mayr emphasised reproductive isolation like species concepts hard even impossible test6061 later biologists tried refine mayrs definition recognition cohesion concepts among others62 many concepts quite similar overlap easy count biologist mayden recorded concepts63 philosopher science john wilkins counted 2660
typological morphological speciesedit




adult eurasian blue tits share coloration unmistakably identifying morphospecies64


typological species group organisms individuals conform certain fixed properties type even preliterate people often recognise taxon modern taxonomists6566 clusters variations phenotypes within specimens longer shorter tails would differentiate species method used classical method determining species linnaeus early evolutionary theory however different phenotypes necessarily different species fourwinged drosophila born twowinged mother different species species named manner called morphospecies6768

recognition cohesion speciesedit
materecognition species group sexually reproducing organisms recognize another potential mates3769 expanding allow postmating isolation cohesion species inclusive population individuals potential phenotypic cohesion intrinsic cohesion mechanisms matter whether populations hybridize successfully still distinct cohesion species amount hybridization insufficient completely respective gene pools43 development recognition concept provided biosemiotic concept species70
vavilovian speciesedit
nikolai vavilov developed ways define conceive linnaean species species systems integral entity consisting closely interlinked components71 emphasised variability within species relativity taxonomic criteria accumulation genetic variation within species evolutionary point view compared species knots evolutionary chains building komarovs aphorism species morphological system plus geographic distinctness 1930 vavilov defined linnaean species isolated complex dynamic morphphysiological system bound origin certain environment area72

genetic similarity barcode speciesedit
microbiology genes move freely even distantly related bacteria possibly extending whole bacterial domain rule thumb microbiologists assumed kinds bacteria archaea ribosomal gene sequences similar need checked dnadna hybridisation decide belong species not73 concept narrowed 2006 similarity 98774
dnadna hybridisation results however sometimes misleading conclusions species pomarine great skua7576
barcoding proposed distinguish species suitable even nonspecialists use77 socalled barcode region mitochondrial within gene cytochrome oxidase database barcode life data systems bold contains barcode sequences 190000 species7879 however scientists desalle expressed concern classical taxonomy barcoding consider misnomer need reconciled delimit species differently80 werner kunz observes barcoding cannot distinguish rapidlycreated sympatric species almost identical genomes differing genes habitats means kunz argues several species concepts disagree barcode species concept
evolutionary speciesedit
single evolutionary lineage organisms within genes shared maintains integrity respect lineages time space point evolution group members diverge main population evolve subspecies process eventually lead formation species isolation geographical ecological maintained species evolve previous species speciation process species gives rise another species paraphyletic species paraspecies single lineage ancestordescendant population evolutionary tendencies historical fates distinct lineages82

phylogenetic cladistic speciesedit
phylogenetic cladistic species evolutionarily divergent lineage maintained hereditary integrity time space838485 cladistic species smallest group populations distinguished unique morphological genetic traits molecular markers used determine genetic similarities nuclear mitochondrial various species848687 example study done fungi studying nucleotide characters using cladistic species produced accurate results recognising numerous fungi species concepts studied87
unlike biological species concept cladistic species rely reproductive isolation independent processes integral concepts86 works asexual lineages detect recent divergences morphological species concept cannot8487 however work every situation require polymorphic locus give accurate result87 concept lead splitting existing species example bovidae many ones888990
ecological speciesedit
ecological species organisms adapted particular resources called niche environment according concept populations form discrete phenetic clusters recognise species ecological evolutionary processes controlling resources divided tend produce clusters91
genetic speciesedit
genetic species defined robert baker robert bradley genetically isolated interbreeding populations similar mayrs biological species concept stresses genetic rather reproductive isolation92
evolutionarily significant unitedit
evolutionarily significant unit wildlife species93 population organisms considered distinct purposes conservation94
phenetic speciesedit

changeedit
species subject change whether evolving species95 exchanging genes species96 becoming extinct97
speciationedit
main article speciation
evolutionary process biological populations evolve become distinct species called speciation9899 charles darwin first describe role natural selection speciation 1859 book origin species100 speciation depends measure reproductive isolation reduced gene flow occurs easily allopatric speciation populations separated geographically diverge gradually mutations accumulate reproductive isolation threatened hybridisation selected pair populations incompatible alleles gene described bateson–dobzhansky–muller model95
exchange genes speciesedit




horizontal gene transfers widely separated species complicate phylogeny bacteria


main article horizontal gene transfer
horizontal gene transfer organisms different species either hybridisation antigenic shift reassortment sometimes important source genetic variation viruses transfer genes species bacteria exchange plasmids bacteria species including apparently distantly related ones different phylogenetic domains making analysis relationships difficult weakening concept bacterial species1014010296
louismarie bobay howard ochman suggest based analysis genomes many types bacteria often grouped communities regularly swap genes much plants animals grouped reproductively isolated breeding populations bacteria thus form species analogous mayrs biological species concept consisting asexually reproducing populations exchange genes homologous recombination103104
