barbarian identityedit
analysis barbarian identity created expressed barbarian invasions elicited discussion among scholars herwig wolfram historian goths22 discussing equation migratio gentium völkerwanderung observes michael schmidt introduced equation 1778 history germans wolfram observed significance gens biological community shifting even early middle ages complicate matters devising terminology derived concept nationhood created french revolution
primordialistic23 paradigm prevailed 19th century scholars german linguist johann gottfried herder viewed tribes coherent biological racial entities using term refer discrete ethnic groups24 also believed volk organic whole core identity spirit evident literature language characteristics seen intrinsic unaffected external influences even conquest25 language particular seen important expression ethnicity argued groups sharing similar language possessed common identity ancestry26 romantic ideal single german celtic slavic people originated common homeland spoke common tongue helping provide conceptual framework political movements 18th 19th centuries pangermanism panslavism25
1960s reinterpretation archaeological historic evidence prompted scholars goffart todd propose models explaining construction barbarian identity maintained sense shared identity perceived germani272829 similar theory proposed celtic slavic groups30
theory states primordialist mode thinking encouraged prima facie interpretation graecoroman sources grouped together many tribes labels germani keltoi sclavenoi thus encouraging perception distinct peoples modernists argue uniqueness perceived specific groups based common political economic interests rather biological racial distinctions
role language constructing maintaining group identity ephemeral since largescale language shifts occur commonly history31 modernists propose idea imagined communities barbarian polities late antiquity social constructs rather unchanging lines blood kinship32 process forming tribal units called ethnogenesis term coined soviet scholar yulian bromley33 austrian school reinhard wenskus popularized idea influenced medievalists herwig wolfram walter pohl patrick geary27 argues stimulus forming tribal polities perpetuated small nucleus people known traditionskern kernel tradition military aristocratic elite core group formed standard larger units gathering adherents employing amalgamative metaphors kinship aboriginal commonality claiming perpetuated ancient divinelysanctioned lineage34

viewpointsedit
historians postulated several explanations appearance barbarians roman frontier weather crops population pressure primeval urge push mediterranean domino effect huns falling upon goths turn pushed germanic tribes entire barbarian tribes nations flooded roman provincescitation needed ending classical urbanism beginning types rural settlements36 general french italian scholars tended view catastrophic event destruction civilization beginning dark europe back millennium36 contrast german english historians tended romanbarbarian interaction replacement tired effete decadent mediterranean civilization virile martial nordic one36
rather invasion german slavic scholars speak migration german völkerwanderung czech stěhování národů swedish folkvandring hungarian népvándorlás aspiring idea dynamic wandering indogermanic people37
scholar halsall seen barbarian movement result fall roman empire cause36 archaeological finds confirmed germanic slavic tribes settled agriculturalists38 probably merely drawn politics empire already falling apart quite causes crisis third century caused significant changes within roman empire western eastern portions39 particular economic fragmentation removed many political cultural economic forces held empire together40
rural population roman provinces became distanced metropolis little differentiate peasants across roman frontier addition rome increasingly used foreign mercenaries defend barbarisation parallelled changes within barbaricum41
example roman empire played vital role building barbarian groups along frontier propped imperial support gifts armies allied barbarian chieftains served buffers hostile barbarian groups disintegration roman economic power weakened groups come depend roman gifts maintenance power arrival huns helped prompt many groups invade provinces economic reasons42
nature barbarian takeover former roman provinces varied region region example aquitaine provincial administration largely selfreliant halsall argued local rulers simply handed military rule ostrogoths acquiring identity newcomers14 gaul collapse imperial rule resulted anarchy franks alemanni pulled ensuing power vacuum43 resulting conflict spain local aristocrats maintained independent rule time raising armies vandals meanwhile roman withdrawal lowland england resulted conflict saxons brythonic chieftains whose centres power retreated westward result eastern roman empire attempted maintain control balkan provinces despite thinlyspread imperial army relying mainly local militias extensive effort refortify danubian limes ambitious fortification efforts collapsed worsening impoverished conditions local populace resulting colonization slavic warriors families44
halsall noble argued changes stemmed breakdown roman political control exposed weakness local roman rule instead largescale migrations military takeovers small groups warriors families usually numbered tens thousands process involved active conscious decisionmaking roman provincial populations
collapse centralized control severely weakened sense roman identity provinces explain provinces underwent dramatic cultural changes even though barbarians settled them45
ultimately germanic groups western roman empire accommodated without dispossessing overturning indigenous society maintained structured hierarchical attenuated form roman administration46
ironically lost unique identity result accommodation absorbed latinhood contrast east slavic tribes maintained spartan egalitarian47 existence bound land even times took part plundering roman provinces48 organizational models roman leaders normally dependent roman gold success thus arguably greater effect region goths franks saxons theirs49
