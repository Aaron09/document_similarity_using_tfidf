historically industry suffered absence global rulescitation needed tendency towards statesupported overinvestment fact shipyards offer wide range technologies employ significant number workers generate income shipbuilding market global
shipbuilding therefore attractive industry developing nations japan used shipbuilding 1950s 1960s rebuild industrial structure south korea started make shipbuilding strategic industry 1970s china process repeating models large statesupported investments industry conversely croatia privatising shipbuilding industry
