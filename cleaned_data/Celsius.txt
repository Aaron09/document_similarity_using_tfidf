1742 swedish astronomer anders celsius 1701–1744 created temperature scale reverse scale known name celsius represented boiling point water represented freezing point water5 paper observations persistent degrees thermometer recounted experiments showing melting point essentially unaffected pressure also determined remarkable precision boiling point water varied function atmospheric pressure proposed zero point temperature scale boiling point would calibrated mean barometric pressure mean level pressure known standard atmosphere bipms 10th general conference weights measures cgpm later defined standard atmosphere equal precisely 1013250dynes square centimetre 101325 kpa6
1743 lyonnais physicist jeanpierre christin permanent secretary académie sciences belleslettres arts lyonfr working independently celsius developed scale zero represented freezing point water represented boiling point water78 1743 published design mercury thermometer thermometer lyon built craftsman pierre casati used scale91011

first known swedish document14 reporting temperatures modern forward celsius scale paper hortus upsaliensis dated december 1745 linnaeus wrote student samuel nauclér linnaeus recounted temperatures inside orangery university uppsala botanical garden

since caldarium part greenhouse angle windows merely rays obtains heat thermometer often reaches degrees although keen gardener usually takes care rise degrees winter degrees

centigrade hectograde celsiusedit
since 19th century scientific thermometry communities worldwide referred scale centigrade scale temperatures centigrade scale often reported simply degrees greater specificity desired degrees centigrade symbol term centigrade also spanish french language name unit angular measurement 1100 right angle similar connotation languages term centesimal degree known gradian grad 100ᵍ used precise unambiguous language required international standards bodies bipm properly defined centigrade would hectograde furthermore context centigradehectograde referring whole 0–100 range given part thereof hence centigrade means gradians hectograde literal description gradians

descriptively correct centigrade hectocentigrade gradians

eliminate confusion cgpm cipm comité international poids mesures formally adopted degree celsius 194815a formally keeping recognized degree symbol rather adopting gradiancentesimal degree symbol
scientific celsius term usually used centigrade otherwise continuing common decreasing especially informal contexts englishspeaking countries16 february 1985 forecasts issued switched centigrade celsius17

name symbol typesettingedit
degree celsius unit whose full unit name contains uppercase letter since base unit temperature kelvin became proper name 1967 replacing term degrees kelvin plural form degrees celsius21
general rule international bureau weights measures bipm numerical value always precedes unit space always used separate unit number 302°c 302° thus value quantity product number unit space regarded multiplication sign space units implies multiplication exceptions rule unit symbols degree minute second plane angle respectively space left numerical value unit symbol23 languages various publishing houses follow different typographical rules
unicode characteredit
