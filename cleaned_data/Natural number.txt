primitive method representing natural number mark object later objects could tested equality excess shortage striking mark removing object
first major advance abstraction numerals represent numbers allowed systems developed recording large numbers ancient egyptians developed powerful system numerals distinct hieroglyphs powers million stone carving karnak dating around 1500 louvre paris depicts hundreds tens ones similarly number 4622 babylonians placevalue system based essentially numerals using base sixty symbol sixty symbol value determined context13
much later advance development idea considered number numeral digit placevalue notation within numbers dates back early babylonians omitted digit would last symbol number14 olmec maya civilizations used separate number early century usage spread beyond mesoamerica1516 numeral modern times originated indian mathematician brahmagupta however used number medieval computus calculation date easter beginning dionysius exiguus without denoted numeral standard roman numerals symbol instead nulla genitive form nullae nullus latin word none employed denote value17
first systematic study numbers abstractions usually credited greek philosophers pythagoras archimedes greek mathematicians treated number differently larger numbers sometimes even number all18
independent studies also occurred around time india china mesoamerica19

19th century europe mathematical philosophical discussion exact nature natural numbers schoolwhich naturalism stated natural numbers direct consequence human psyche henri poincaré advocates leopold kronecker summarized made integers else work man20
opposition naturalists constructivists need improve logical rigor foundations mathematics21 1860s hermann grassmann suggested recursive definition natural numbers thus stating really natural consequence definitions later classes formal definitions constructed later shown equivalent practical applications
settheoretical definitions natural numbers initiated frege initially defined natural number class sets onetoone correspondence particular definition turned lead paradoxes including russells paradox therefore formalism modified natural number defined particular onetoone correspondence said number elements22
second class definitions introduced giuseppe peano called peano arithmetic based axiomatization properties ordinal numbers natural number successor every nonzero natural number unique predecessor peano arithmetic equiconsistent several weak systems theory system axiom infinity replaced negation theorems proved cannot proved using peano axioms include goodsteins theorem23
definitions convenient include corresponding empty natural number including common convention among theorists24 logicians25 mathematicians also include although many kept older tradition take first natural number26 computer scientists often start zero enumerating items like loop counters string array elements2728
notationedit




doublestruck capital symbol often used denote natural numbers list mathematical symbols


mathematicians blackboard bold refer natural numbers older texts also occasionally employed symbol set29 countably infinite infinite countable definition also expressed saying cardinal number alephnaught ℵ030
unambiguous whether included sometimes index superscript added former case superscript subscript added latter case1




alternatively natural numbers distinguished positive integers index notation must understood context since symbols used natural numbers contain zero31




propertiesedit
additionedit
recursively define addition operator natural numbers setting read successor turns natural numbers commutative monoid identity element socalled free object generator monoid satisfies cancellation property embedded group mathematical sense word group smallest group containing natural numbers integers
defined simply successor
multiplicationedit

relationship addition multiplicationedit
addition multiplication compatible expressed distribution properties addition multiplication make natural numbers instance commutative semiring semirings algebraic generalization natural numbers multiplication necessarily commutative lack additive inverses equivalent fact closed subtraction subtracting natural another always result another natural means ring instead semiring also known
natural numbers taken excluding starting definitions except begin
orderedit

generalizationsedit
important generalizations natural numbers arise uses counting ordering cardinal numbers ordinal numbers

natural number used express size finite precisely cardinal number measure size even suitable infinite sets concept size relies maps sets sets size exactly exists bijection natural numbers bijective image said countably infinite cardinality alephnull
natural numbers also used linguistic ordinal numbers first second third forth assigned elements totally ordered finite also elements wellordered countably infinite assignment generalized general wellorderings cardinality beyond countability yield ordinal numbers ordinal number also used describe notion size wellordered sense different cardinality order isomorphism bijection wellordered sets ordinal number first ordinal number natural number expressed also ordinal number natural numbers

many wellordered sets cardinal number ordinal number greater latter lowest possible least ordinal cardinality initial ordinal
finite wellordered sets onetoone correspondence ordinal cardinal numbers therefore expressed natural number number elements number also used describe position element larger finite infinite sequence

empty
define every successor called successor function
axiom infinity exists contains closed successor function sets said inductive intersection inductive sets defined natural numbers checked natural numbers satisfies peano axioms
follows natural number equal natural numbers less












definition natural number particular elements subset
also definition different possible interpretations notations like ntuples versus mappings coincide
even accept axiom infinity therefore cannot accept natural numbers exists still possible define sets
