believe doctrineedit
main article believe
william jamess lecture 1896 titled believe james defends right violate principle evidentialism order justify hypothesis venturing idea foresaw 20th century objections evidentialism sought ground justified belief unwavering principle would prove beneficial philosophy pragmatism william james justifies religious beliefs using results hypothetical venturing evidence support hypothesis truth therefore doctrine allows assume belief prove existence belief brings ones life
criticized advocates skepticism rationality like bertrand russell free thought official propaganda alfred henry lloyd doubt argued must always adhere fallibilism recognizing human knowledge none beliefs quite true least penumbra vagueness error means progressing evercloser truth never assume certainty always examine sides reach conclusion objectively
free willedit
believe james simply asserted free first freedom said chose believe free encouraged reading charles renouvier whose work convinced james convert monism pluralism diary entry april 1870 james wrote

think yesterday crisis life finished first part renouviers second essais reason definition free will—the sustaining thought choose might thoughts—need definition illusion rate assume present—until next year—that illusion first free shall believe free will28

1884 james terms future discussions determinism compatibilism free debates lecture harvard divinity school students published dilemma determinism talk defined common terms hard determinism soft determinism commonly called compatibilism

oldfashioned determinism call hard determinism shrink words fatality bondage necessitation like nowadays soft determinism abhors harsh words repudiating fatality necessity even predetermination says real name freedom freedom necessity understood bondage highest identical true freedom29

james called compatibilism quagmire evasion29 ideas thomas hobbes david hume—that free simply freedom external coercion—were called wretched subterfuge immanuel kant
james described chance neither hard soft determinism indeterminism said

stronghold determinist argument antipathy idea chancethis notion alternative possibility admission several things come pass roundabout name chance30

james asked students consider choice walking home lowell lecture hall talk

meant saying choice walk home lecture ambiguous matter chanceit means divinity avenue oxford street called either shall chosen31

simple example james laid twostage decision process chance present time random alternatives leading choice possibility transforms ambiguous future simple unalterable past james twostage model separates chance undetermined alternative possibilities choice free action individual randomness effect subsequent thinkers using model include henri poincaré arthur holly compton karl popper

religious genius experience primary topic study religion rather religious institutions—since institutions merely social descendant genius
intense even pathological varieties experience religious otherwise sought psychologists represent closest thing microscope mind—that show drastically enlarged form normal processes things
order usefully interpret realm common shared experience history must make certain overbeliefs things cannot proven basis experience help live fuller better lives
religious mysticism half mysticism half composed insane colocated great subliminal transmarginal region32

james investigated mystical experiences throughout life leading experiment chloral hydrate 1870 amyl nitrite 1875 nitrous oxide 1882 peyote 1896citation needed james claimed influence nitrous oxide able understand hegel33 concluded revelations mystic hold true hold true mystic others certainly ideas considered hold claim truth without personal experience american philosophy encyclopedia classes several figures took pantheist pandeist approach rejecting views separate world34
