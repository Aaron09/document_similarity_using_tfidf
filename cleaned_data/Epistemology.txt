mathematics known also knowing numbers knowing person oneself place ones hometown thing cars activity addition philosophers think important distinction knowing know concept knowing understand operation acquaintanceknowledge know relation epistemology primarily concerned first these10
distinctions explicit english defined explicitly languages languages related english said retain verbs scots french portuguese spanish german dutch know person translated using connaître conhecer conocer kennen respectively whereas know something translated using savoir saber wissen weten modern greek verbs γνωρίζω gnorízo ξέρω kséro italian verbs conoscere sapere nouns knowledge conoscenza sapienza german verbs wissen kennen wissen implies knowing fact kennen implies knowing sense acquainted working knowledge also noun derived kennen namely erkennen said imply knowledge form recognition acknowledgment verb implies process state another state noterkennen state true erkennen verb seems appropriate terms describing episteme modern european languages hence german name erkenntnistheorie theoretical interpretation significance linguistic issues remains controversial
paper denoting later book problems philosophy bertrand russell stressed distinction knowledge description knowledge acquaintance gilbert ryle also credited stressing distinction knowing knowing concept mind personal knowledge michael polanyi argues epistemological relevance knowledge knowledge using example balance involved riding bicycle suggests theoretical knowledge physics involved maintaining state balance cannot substitute practical knowledge ride important understand established grounded position essentially ryles argued failure acknowledge distinction knowledge knowledge leads infinite regress
recent times epistemologists including sosa greco kvanvig zagzebski duncan pritchard argued epistemology evaluate peoples properties intellectual virtues properties propositions propositional mental attitudescitation needed
beliefedit
main article belief
common speech statement belief typically expression faith trust person power entity—while includes traditional views epistemology also concerned believe includes truth everything else accept true cognitive point view
truthedit
main article truth
also criteria truth
whether someones belief true prerequisite belief hand something actually known categorically cannot false example person believes bridge safe enough support attempts cross bridge collapses weight could said believed bridge safe belief mistaken would accurate knew bridge safe plainly contrast bridge actually supported weight might believed bridge safe whereas proving crossing knows safe
epistemologists argue whether belief proper truthbearer would rather describe knowledge system justified true propositions others system justified true sentences plato gorgias argues belief commonly invoked truthbearer11
justificationedit
theaetetus socrates considers number theories knowledge last knowledge true belief account meaning explained defined according theory knowledge justified true belief order know given proposition true must believe relevant true proposition must also good reason implication would would gain knowledge believing something happened true example person medical training generally optimistic attitude might believe recover illness quickly nevertheless even belief turned true patient would known would well since belief lacked justification

reliabilismedit
main article reliabilism
reliabilism significant line response gettier problem among philosophers originating work alvin goldman 1960s according reliabilism belief justified otherwise supported count towards knowledge produced processes typically yield sufficiently high ratio true false beliefs words theory states true belief counts knowledge produced reliable beliefforming process examples reliable processes include standard perceptual processes remembering good reasoning introspection15
reliabilism challenged gettier cases another argument challenges reliabilism like gettier cases although presented short article gettier cases case henry barn façades thought experiment henry driving along sees number buildings resemble barns based perception concludes seen barns seen perception based belief real barn barnlike buildings façades theoretically henry know seen barn despite belief seen true belief formed basis reliable process vision since acquired true belief accident16

timothy williamson advanced theory knowledge according knowledge justified true belief plus extra conditions primary book knowledge limits williamson argues concept knowledge cannot broken concepts analysis—instead generis thus though knowledge requires justification truth belief word knowledge cant according williamsons theory accurately regarded simply shorthand justified true belief

priori posteriori knowledgeedit
main article priori posteriori
nature distinction disputed various philosophers however terms roughly defined follows

priori knowledge knowledge known independently experience nonempirical arrived beforehand usually reason henceforth acquired anything independent experience
posteriori knowledge knowledge known experience empirical arrived afterward

priori knowledge gaining knowledge without need experience bruce russells article priori justification knowledge30 says knowledge based priori justification relies intuition nature intuitions priori knowledge often contrasted posteriori knowledge knowledge gained experience look difference example bruce russell gives propositions reader decides believes option crows birds option crows black believe option priori justified believing dont crow know bird believe option posteriori justified believe seen many crows therefore knowing black goes doesnt matter statement true believe matters
idea priori knowledge based intuition rational insights laurence bonjour says article structure empirical knowledge31 rational insight immediate noninferential grasp apprehension seeing proposition necessarily true going back crow example laurence bonjours definition reason would believe option immediate knowledge crow bird without ever experiencing

john pollock stated

justify belief must appeal justified belief means things case either beliefs justified holding without able justify basis belief else justified belief infinite regress potential justification nebula theory theory rock bottom justification justification meanders network beliefs stopping nowhere40

apparent impossibility completing infinite chain reasoning thought support skepticism also impetus descartes famous dictum think therefore descartes looking logical statement could true without appeal statements
