graphical designedit
features specific topography terrain cartography contour lines topographic conventions
maximize readability contour maps several design choices available creator principally line weight line color line type method numerical marking
line weight simply darkness thickness line used choice made based upon least intrusive form contours enable reader decipher background information little content base contour lines drawn relatively heavy thickness also many forms contours topographic maps common vary line weight andor color different line characteristic occurs certain numerical values example topographic even hundred foot elevations shown different weight twenty foot intervals
line color choice number pigments suit display sometimes sheen gloss used well color contour lines apart base line colour varied show information
line type refers whether basic contour line solid dashed dotted broken pattern create desired effect dotted dashed lines often used underlying base conveys important difficult read information broken line types used location contour line inferred
numerical marking manner denoting arithmetical values contour lines done placing numbers along contour lines typically using interpolation intervening lines alternatively produced associating contours values
contour lines numerically labeled adjacent lines style weight color type direction gradient cannot determined contour lines alone however contour lines cycle three styles direction gradient determined lines orientation numerical text labels often used indicate direction slope
plan view versus profile viewedit
also topographic profile
commonly contour lines drawn plan view observer space would view earths surface ordinary form however parameters often displayed profile view showing vertical profile parameter mapped common parameters mapped profile pollutant concentrations sound levels cases important analyze pollutant concentrations sound levels varying heights determine quality noise health effects people different elevations example living different floor levels urban apartment actuality plan profile view contour maps used pollution noise pollution studies
