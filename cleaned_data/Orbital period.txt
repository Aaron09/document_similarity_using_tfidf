orbital period time given astronomical object takes complete orbit around another object applies astronomy usually planets asteroids orbiting moons orbiting planets exoplanets orbiting stars binary stars
objects solar system often referred sidereal period determined 360° revolution celestial body around another earth orbiting name sidereal added implies object returns position relative fixed stars projected describing orbits binary stars orbital period usually referred period example jupiter sidereal period 1186 years main binary star alpha centauri period 7991 years
another important orbital period definition refer repeated cycles celestial bodies observed earths surface example socalled synodic period applying elapsed time planets return kind phenomena location example planet returns consecutive observed conjunctions oppositions example jupiter synodic period 3988 days earth thus jupiters opposition occurs roughly every months
periods astronomy conveniently expressed various units time often hours days years also defined different specific astronomical definitions mostly caused small complex eternal gravitational influences celestial objects variations also include true placement centre gravity astronomical bodies barycenter perturbations planets bodies orbital resonance general relativity investigated detailed complex astronomical theories using celestial mechanics using precise positional observations celestial objects astrometry

periods related orbital periodedit
many periods related orbits objects often used various fields astronomy astrophysics examples common ones include

sidereal period amount time takes object make full orbit relative stars orbital period inertial nonrotating frame reference
synodic period amount time takes object reappear point relation objects moons phase position relative earth repeats every synodic period longer orbit around earth motion earth time successive oppositions conjunctions also example synodic period planets solar system synodic period respect earth differs sidereal period earths orbiting around
draconitic period draconic period time elapses passages object ascending node point orbit crosses ecliptic southern northern hemisphere period differs sidereal period orbital plane object plane ecliptic precess respect fixed stars intersection line nodes also precesses respect fixed stars although plane ecliptic often held fixed position occupied specific epoch orbital plane object still precesses causing draconitic period differ sidereal period
anomalistic period time elapses passages object periapsis case planets solar system called perihelion point closest approach attracting body differs sidereal period objects semimajor axis typically advances slowly
also earths tropical period simply year time elapses alignments axis rotation also viewed passages object right ascension zero earth year slightly shorter interval solar orbit sidereal period inclined axis equatorial plane slowly precess rotate respect stars realigning orbit completes earths precession cycle completes 25770 yearscitation needed
