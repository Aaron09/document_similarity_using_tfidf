logographic systemsedit
logographic systems include earliest writing systems first historical civilizations near east africa china central america used form logographic writing
purely logographic script would impractical languages none known1 apart devised artificial language toki pona purposely limited language morphemes logographic scripts ever used natural languages rely rebus principle extend relatively limited logograms subset characters used phonetic values either consonantal syllabic term logosyllabary used emphasize partially phonetic nature scripts phonetic domain syllable ancient egyptian hieroglyphs chinese additional development fusing phonetic elements determinatives radical phonetic characters make bulk script languages relegated simple rebuses spelling foreign loan words words nonstandard dialects
logographic writing systems include

logoconsonantal scripts

scripts graphemes extended phonetically according consonants words represent ignoring vowels example egyptian











used write duck though likely words pronounced apart consonants primary examples logoconsonantal scripts


hieroglyphs hieratic demotic ancient egyptian


logosyllabic scripts

scripts graphemes represent morphemes often polysyllabic morphemes extended phonetically represent single syllables include


anatolian hieroglyphs luwian
cuneiform sumerian akkadian semitic languages elamite hittite luwian hurrian urartian

none systems purely logographic illustrated chinese chinese characters represent morphemes morphemes composed character example chinese word spider zhīzhū created fusing rebus zhīzhū literally know cinnabar determinative neither used separately except stand poetry archaic chinese find reverse single character representing morpheme example archaic chinese hjwangs combination morpheme hjwang meaning king coincidentally also written suffix pronounced suffix preserved modern falling tone modern mandarin bimorphemic syllables always written characters example huār flower diminutive
peculiar system logograms developed within pahlavi scripts developed aramaic abjad used write middle persian much sassanid period logograms composed letters spelled word aramaic pronounced persian instance combination would pronounced shah logograms called hozwārishn form heterograms dispensed altogether arab conquest persia adoption variant arabic alphabet
logograms used modern shorthand represent common words addition numerals mathematical symbols logograms plus equals english ampersand used many languages latin cetera percent cent number pound among meanings section dollar euro pound degree
semantic phonetic dimensionsedit
information determinative
historical logographic systems include phonetic dimension impractical separate basic character every word morpheme languagea cases cuneiform used akkadian vast majority glyphs used sound values rather logographically many logographic systems also semanticideographic component called determinatives case egyptian radicals case chineseb
typical egyptian usage augment logogram potentially represent several words different pronunciations determinate narrow meaning phonetic component specify pronunciation case chinese vast majority characters fixed combination radical indicates nominal category plus phonetic give idea pronunciation mayan system used logograms phonetic complements like egyptian lacking ideographic components
chinese charactersedit
main article chinese character classification
chinese scholars traditionally classified chinese characters hànzì types etymology
first types singlebody meaning character created independently characters singlebody pictograms ideograms make small proportion chinese logograms productive chinese script compound methods character created assembling different characters despite called compounds logograms still single characters written take amount space logogram final types methods usage characters rather formation characters




excerpt 1936 primer chinese characters



first type type often associated chinese writing pictograms pictorial representations morpheme represented mountain
second type ideograms attempt visualize abstract concepts also considered ideograms pictograms ideographic indicator instance pictogram meaning knife ideogram meaning blade
radicalradical compounds element character called radical hints meaning example rest composed characters person tree intended idea someone leaning tree resting
radicalphonetic compounds component radical indicates general meaning character phonetic hints pronunciation example liáng phonetic liáng indicates pronunciation character radical wood indicates meaning supporting beam characters type constitute around chinese logograms2
changedannotation characters characters originally character bifurcated orthographic often semantic drift instance mean music pleasure
improvisational characters improvisedborrowedwords come native spoken word corresponding character hence another character similar sound often close meaning borrowed occasionally meaning supplant meaning example used pictographic word meaning nose borrowed mean self used almost exclusively mean latter original meaning survives stock phrases archaic compounds derivational process entire japanese kana considered type character hence name kana example japanese simplified form chinese used korea japan chinese name type

productive method chinese writing radicalphonetic made possible ignoring certain distinctions phonetic system syllables chinese postfinal ending consonants typically ignored developed tones middle chinese likewise ignored characters created also ignored differences aspiration aspirated unaspirated obstruents voiced unvoiced sonorants chinese difference typea typeb syllables often described presence absence palatalization pharyngealization sometimes voicing initial obstruents andor presence medial initial consonant earlier times greater phonetic freedom generally allowed middle chinese times newly created characters tended match pronunciation exactly tone often using phonetic component character radicalphonetic compound
long period language evolution component hints within characters provided radicalphonetic compounds sometimes useless misleading modern usage example based pronounced standard mandarin characters humiliate regret pronounced respectively mandarin three characters pronounced similarly chinese mˤəʔ m̥ˤəʔ m̥ˤəʔ according recent reconstruction william baxter laurent sagart3 sound changes intervening 3000 years including different dialectal developments case last characters resulted radically different pronunciations
chinese characters used japanese koreanedit
within context chinese language chinese characters known hanzi large represent words morphemes rather pure ideas however adoption chinese characters japanese korean languages known kanji hanja respectively resulted complications picture
many chinese words composed chinese morphemes borrowed japanese korean together character representations case morphemes characters borrowed together cases however characters borrowed represent native japanese korean morphemes basis meaning alone result single character representing multiple morphemes similar meaning different origins across several languages kanji hanja sometimes described morphographic writing systemscitation needed
differences processing logographic phonologic languagesedit
much research language processing centered english alphabet languages many theories language processing stressed role phonology instance weaver producing speech contrasting logographic languages single character represented phonetically ideographically phonetic languages yielded insights different languages rely different processing mechanisms studies processing logographic languages amongst things looked neurobiological differences processing area particular interest hemispheric lateralization since logographic languages closely associated images alphabet languages several researchers hypothesized rightside activation prominent logographic languages although studies yielded results consistent hypothesis many contrasting results make final conclusions role hemispheric lateralization orthographic versus phonetic languages4
another topic given attention differences processing homophones verdonschot examined differences time took read homophone loud picture either related unrelated homophonic character presented character japanese chinese homophones examined whereas word production alphabetic languages english shown relatively robust immunity effect context stimuli7 verdschot found japanese homophones seem particularly sensitive types effects specifically reaction times shorter participants presented phonologically related picture asked read target character loud example phonologically related stimulus study would instance participants presented picture elephant pronounced japanese presented chinese character also read effect phonologically related context pictures found reaction times reading chinese words comparison logographic languages japanese chinese interesting whereas japanese language consists homographic heterophones characters read different ways chinese characters reading languages logographic difference latency reading aloud japanese chinese context effects cannot ascribed logographic nature languages instead authors hypothesize difference latency times additional processing costs japanese reader cannot rely solely direct orthographytophonology route information lexicalsyntactical level must also accessed order choose correct pronunciation hypothesis corroborated studies finding japanese alzheimers disease patients whose comprehension characters deteriorated still could read words loud particular difficulty910
studies contrasting processing english chinese homophones lexical decision tasks found advantage homophone processing chinese disadvantage processing homophones english11 processing disadvantage english usually described terms relative lack homophones english language homophonic word encountered phonological representation word first activated however since ambiguous stimulus matching orthographiclexical mental dictionary level necessary stimulus disambiguated correct pronunciation chosen contrast language chinese many characters reading exists hypothesized person reading character familiar homophones familiarity processing character subsequent selection correct pronunciation leading shorter reaction times attending stimulus attempt better understand homophony effects processing hino conducted series experiments using japanese target language controlling familiarity found processing advantage homophones nonhomophones japanese similar previously found chinese researchers also tested whether orthographically similar homophones would yield disadvantage processing case english homophones12 found evidence evident difference homophones processed logographic alphabetic languages whether advantage processing homophones logographic languages japanese chinese logographic nature scripts merely reflects advantage languages homophones regardless script nature remains seen
advantages disadvantagesedit
separating writing pronunciationedit
main difference logograms writing systems graphemes linked directly pronunciation advantage separation understanding pronunciation language writer unnecessary understood regardless whether called ichi wāḥid reader likewise people speaking different varieties chinese understand speaking significant extent writing even write standard chinese therefore china vietnam korea japan prior modern times communication writing norm east asian international trade diplomacycitation neededdubious discuss
separation however also great disadvantage requiring memorization logograms learning read write separately pronunciation though inherent feature logograms unique history development japanese added complication almost every logogram pronunciation conversely phonetic character written precisely spoken disadvantage slight pronunciation differences introduce ambiguities many alphabetic systems greek latin italian spanish finnish make practical compromise standardizing words written maintaining nearly onetoone relation characters sounds english french orthography complicated character combinations often pronounced multiple ways usually depending history hangul korean languages writing system example alphabetic script designed replace logogrammic hanja order increase literacy latter rarely used korea retains currency south korea sometimes combination hangulcitation needed
according governmentcommissioned research commonly used 3500 characters listed peoples republic chinas chart common characters modern chinese 现代汉语常用字表 xiàndài hànyǔ chángyòngzì biǎo cover 9948 twomillionword sample case traditional chinese characters 4808 characters listed chart standard forms common national characters 常用國字標準字體表 ministry education republic china 4759 soengjung zijing 常用字字形表 education manpower bureau hong kong intended taught elementary junior secondary education education elementary school includes many characters words mostly combinations already learned characters13
characters information technologyedit
inputting complex characters cumbersome electronic devices practical limitation number input keys exist various input methods entering logograms either breaking constituent parts cangjie wubi methods typing chinese using phonetic systems bopomofo pinyin word entered pronounced selected list logograms matching former method linearly faster difficult learn chinese alphabet system however strokes forming logogram typed normally written corresponding logogram enteredclarification needed
also number glyphs programming computing general memory needed store grapheme character larger comparison 8859 requires byte grapheme basic multilingual plane encoded utf8 requires three bytes hand english words example average five characters space word14 thus need bytes every word since many logograms contain grapheme clear memoryefficient variablewidth encodings allow unified character encoding standard unicode bytes necessary represent character reducing overhead results merging large character sets smaller ones
