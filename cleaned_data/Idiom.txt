relatively recent development syntactic analysis idioms departs constituentbased account syntactic structure preferring instead catenabased account catena unit introduced linguistics william ogrady 1998 word combination words linked together dependencies qualifies catena17 words constituting idioms stored catenae lexicon concrete units syntax dependency grammar trees sentences containing nonconstituent idioms illustrate point







fixed words idiom orange case linked together dependencies form catena material outside idiom normal black script part idiom following trees illustrate proverbs







fixed words proverbs orange form catena time adjective nittygritty adverb always part respective proverb appearance interrupt fixed words proverb caveat concerning catenabased analysis idioms concerns status lexicon idioms lexical items means stored catenae lexicon actual syntax however idioms broken various functional constructions
