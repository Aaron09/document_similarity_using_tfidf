voice term used phonetics phonology characterize speech sounds usually consonants also called voicing speech sounds described either voiceless also called unvoiced voiced
term however used refer separate concepts

voicing refer articulatory process vocal folds vibrate primary phonetics describe phones particular speech sounds
also refer classification speech sounds tend associated vocal cord vibration actually voiced articulatory level terms primary phonology describe phonemes phonetics primary describe phones

articulatory level voiced sound vocal folds vibrate voiceless sound
example voicing accounts difference pair sounds associated english letters sounds transcribed distinguish english letters several possible pronunciations depending context places fingers voice location adams apple upper throat feel vibration zzzz pronounced ssss detailed technical explanation modal voice phonation european languages notable exception icelandic vowels sonorants consonants modally voiced
used classify speech sounds voiced unvoiced merely labels used group phones phonemes together purposes classification
