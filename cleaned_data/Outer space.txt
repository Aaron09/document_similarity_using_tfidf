greek philosopher aristotle suggested nature abhors vacuum principle became known horror vacui concept built upon 5thcentury ontological argument greek philosopher parmenides denied possible existence void space8 based idea vacuum could exist west widely held many centuries space could empty9 late 17th century french philosopher rené descartes argued entirety space must filled10
ancient china century astronomer zhang heng became convinced space must infinite extending well beyond mechanism supported stars surviving books hsüan school said heavens boundless empty void substance likewise moon company stars float empty space moving standing still11
italian scientist galileo galilei knew mass subject gravity 1640 demonstrated established force resisted formation vacuum however would remain pupil evangelista torricelli create apparatus would produce partial vacuum 1643 experiment resulted first mercury barometer created scientific sensation europe french mathematician blaise pascal reasoned column mercury supported column ought shorter higher altitude pressure lower12 1648 brotherinlaw florin périer repeated experiment dôme mountain central france found column shorter three inches decrease pressure demonstrated carrying halffull balloon mountain watching gradually expand contract upon descent13

1650 german scientist otto guericke constructed first vacuum pump device would refute principle horror vacui correctly noted atmosphere earth surrounds planet like shell density gradually declining altitude concluded must vacuum earth moon14

concept universe filled luminiferous aether remained vogue among scientists early 20th century form aether viewed medium light could propagate19 1887 michelson–morley experiment tried detect earths motion medium looking changes speed light depending direction planets motion however null result indicated something wrong concept idea luminiferous aether abandoned replaced albert einsteins theory special relativity holds speed light vacuum fixed constant independent observers motion frame reference2021

earliest known estimate temperature outer space swiss physicist charles guillaume 1896 using estimated radiation background stars concluded space must heated temperature british physicist arthur eddington made similar calculation derive temperature 1926 german physicist erich regener used total measured energy cosmic rays estimate intergalactic temperature 193326
modern concept outer space based bang cosmology first proposed 1931 belgian physicist georges lemaître27 theory holds universe originated dense form since undergone continuous expansion background energy released initial expansion steadily decreased density leading 1948 prediction american physicists ralph alpher robert herman temperature temperature space26
term outward space used 1842 english poet lady emmeline stuartwortley poem maiden moscow28 expression outer space used astronomical term alexander humboldt 184529 later popularized writings wells 190130 shorter term space older first used mean region beyond earths john miltons paradise lost 166731
