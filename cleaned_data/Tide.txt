laplaces tidal equations
ocean depths much smaller horizontal extent thus response tidal forcing modelled using laplace tidal equations incorporate following features

vertical radial velocity negligible vertical shear—this sheet flow
forcing horizontal tangential
coriolis effect appears inertial force fictitious acting laterally direction flow proportional velocity
surface heights rate change proportional negative divergence velocity multiplied depth horizontal velocity stretches compresses ocean sheet volume thins thickens respectively

boundary conditions dictate flow across coastline free slip bottom
coriolis effect inertial force steers flows moving towards equator west flows moving away equator toward east allowing coastally trapped waves finally dissipation term added analog viscosity
