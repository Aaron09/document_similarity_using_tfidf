early historyedit
creation advanced research projects agency arpa authorized president dwight eisenhower 1958 purpose forming executing research development projects expand frontiers technology science able reach beyond immediate military requirements3 relevant acts supplemental military construction authorization force5 public 85325 department defense directive 510515 february 1958 creation directly attributed launching sputnik realization soviet union developed capacity rapidly exploit military technology initial funding arpa million6 arpas first director johnson left 160000 management general electric 18000 arpa7 herbert york lawrence livermore national laboratory hired scientific assistant8
johnson york keen space projects nasa established later 1958 space projects arpas funding transferred johnson resigned arpa repurposed highrisk highgain basic research posture enthusiastically embraced nations scientists research universities9 arpas second director brigadier general austin betts resigned early 1961 succeeded jack ruina served 196310 ruina first scientist administer arpa managed raise budget million11 ruina hired licklider first administrator information processing techniques office played vital role creation arpanet basis future internet12
additionally political defense communities recognized need highlevel department defense organization formulate execute projects would expand frontiers technology beyond immediate specific requirements military services laboratories pursuit mission darpa developed transferred technology programs encompassing wide range scientific disciplines address full spectrum national security needs
1958 1965 arpas emphasis centered major national issues including space ballistic missile defense nuclear test detection13 1960 civilian space programs transferred national aeronautics space administration nasa military space programs individual services
allowed arpa concentrate efforts project defender defense ballistic missiles project vela nuclear test detection project agile counterinsurgency programs begin work computer processing behavioral sciences materials sciences defender agile programs formed foundation darpa sensor surveillance directed energy particularly study radar infrared sensing xraygamma detection
arpa point 1959 played early role transit also called navsat predecessor global positioning system gps14 fastforward 1959 joint effort darpa johns hopkins applied physics laboratory began finetune early explorers’ discoveries transit sponsored navy developed leadership richard kirschner johns hopkins first satellite positioning system1516
late 1960s transfer mature programs services arpa redefined role concentrated diverse relatively small essentially exploratory research programs agency renamed defense advanced research projects agency darpa 1972 early 1970s emphasized direct energy programs information processing tactical technologies
concerning information processing darpa made great progress initially support development timesharing modern operating systems rely concepts invented multics system developed cooperation among bell labs general electric darpa supported funding project initial twomilliondollar grant17
darpa supported evolution arpanet first widearea packet switching network packet radio network packet satellite network ultimately internet research artificial intelligence fields speech recognition signal processing including parts shakey robot18 darpa also funded development douglas engelbarts computer system mother demos aspen movie probably first hypermedia system important precursor virtual reality
later historyedit
mansfield amendment 1973 expressly limited appropriations defense research arpadarpa projects direct military application somewho contend amendment devastated american science since arpadarpa major funding source basic science projects time national science foundation never made difference expected
resulting brain drain also credited boosting development fledgling personal computer industry young computer scientists left universities startups private research laboratories xerox parc
1976 1981 darpas major projects dominated land space technology tactical armor antiarmor programs infrared sensing spacebased surveillance highenergy laser technology spacebased missile defense antisubmarine warfare advanced cruise missiles advanced aircraft defense applications advanced computing largescale technological program demonstrations joined integrated circuit research resulted submicrometer electronic technology electron devices evolved verylargescale integration vlsi program congressionallymandated charged particle beam program
many successful programs transitioned services foundation technologies automatic target recognition space based sensing propulsion materials transferred strategic defense initiative organization sdio later known ballistic missile defense organization bmdo titled missile defense agency
recent historyedit
1980s attention agency centered information processing aircraftrelated programs including national aerospace plane nasp hypersonic research program strategic computing program enabled darpa exploit advanced processing networking technologies rebuild strengthen relationships universities vietnam addition darpa began pursue concepts small lightweight satellites lightsat directed programs regarding defense manufacturing submarine technology armorantiarmor
october 2009 agency broke ground facility arlington virginia miles pentagon19
fall 2011 darpa hosted 100year starship symposium getting public start thinking seriously interstellar travel20
june 2016 nasa darpa announced planned build xplanes nasas plan setting create whole series planes next years21
july 2016 announced darpa would bring group topnotch computer security experts search security vulnerabilities create patches vulnerabilities called cyber grand challenge cgc22
