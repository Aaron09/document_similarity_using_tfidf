formal definition united states environmental protection agency species intentionally inadvertently brought region area also called exotic nonnative species2
many terms associated introduced species represent subsets introduced species terminology associated introduced species flux various reasons examples terms acclimatized adventive naturalized immigrant species terms refer subset introduced species term invasive used describe introduced species introduced species causes substantial damage area introduced
subset descriptions

acclimatized species introduced species changed physically andor behaviorally order adjust environment acclimatized species necessarily optimally adjusted environment physicallybehaviorally sufficient environment


adventive species


naturalized species plants naturalized plant species refers nonnative plant need human help reproduce maintain population area native

general description introduced species
broadest widely used sense introduced species synonymous nonnative therefore applies well garden farm organisms adequately basic definition given however sources basic definition reproducing wild3 removes consideration introduced species raised grown gardens farms survive without tending people respect plants latter case defined either ornamental cultivated plants
invasive speciesedit
introduction species outside native range required qualified introduced species distinguish introduced species occur except cultivation domestication captivity whereas others become established outside native range reproduce without human assistance species might termed naturalized established wild nonnative species spread beyond place introduction cause damage nearby species called invasive transition introduction establishment invasion described context plants4 introduced species essentially nonnative species invasive species introduced species spreadwidely quickly cause harm environment5 human health valued resources economy calls scientists consider species invasive terms spread reproduction rather harm cause6
according practical definition invasive species introduced become pest location spreading invading natural means term used imply sense urgency actual potential harm example executive order 13112 1999 defines invasive species alien species whose introduction likely cause economic environmental harm harm human health7 biological definition invasive species hand makes reference harm cause fact spread beyond area original introduction
although argue invasive loaded word harm difficult define3 fact matter organisms continue introduced areas native sometimes usually without much regard harm could result
regulatory perspective neither desirable practical list undesirable outright nonnative species although state hawaii adopted approach comes close regulations require definitional distinction nonnatives deemed especially onerous others introduced pest species officially listed invasive best definition invasive species early detection rapid response effective strategy regulating pest species reducing economic environmental impacts introduction
great britain wildlife countryside 1981 prevents introduction animal naturally occurring wild list animals plants introduced previously proved invasive
nature introductionsedit
definition species considered introduced transport area outside native range human mediated introductions humans described either intentional accidental intentional introductions motivated individuals groups either believe newly introduced species beneficial humans location species introduced intentionally regard potential impact unintentional accidental introductions often byproduct human movements thus unbound human motivations subsequent range expansion introduced species involve human activity




wheat triticum introduced worldwide place origin mesopotamia


intentional introductionsedit
species humans intentionally transport regions subsequently become successfully established ways first case organisms purposely released establishment wild sometimes difficult predict whether species become established upon release initially successful humans made repeated introductions improve probability species survive eventually reproduce wild cases clear introduction directly facilitated human desires




male lophura nycthemera silver pheasant native east asia introduced parts europe ornamental reasons


second case species intentionally transported region escape captive cultivated populations subsequently establish independent breeding populations escaped organisms included category initial transport region human motivated
motivations intentional introductionsedit
economic perhaps common motivation introducing species place economic gain nonnative species become common part environment culture even diet little thought given geographic origin example soybeans kiwi fruit wheat honey bees livestock except american bison turkey nonnative species north america collectively nonnative crops livestock comprise food9 benefits nonnatives vast according congressional research service probably exceed costs10
examples species introduced purposes benefiting agriculture aquaculture economic activities widespread11 eurasian carp first introduced united states potential food source apple snail released southeast asia intent used protein source subsequently places like hawaii establish food industry alaska foxes introduced many islands create populations trade twenty species african european dung beetles established australia deliberate introduction australian dung beetle project effort reduce impact livestock manure timber industry promoted introduction monterey pine pinus radiata california australia zealand commercial timber crop examples represent small subsample species moved humans economic interests
rise genetically modified organisms added another potential economic advantage introducing newmodified species different environments companies monsanto earn much profit selling genetically modified seeds added controversy surrounding introduced species effect genetically modified organisms varies organism organism still researched today however rise genetically modified organisms added complexity conversations surrounding introduced species
human enjoymentedit
introductions also important supporting recreation activities otherwise increasing human enjoyment numerous fish game animals introduced purposes sport fishing hunting earthworms invasive species introduced amphibian ambystoma tigrinum threatens endemic california salamander ambystoma californiense introduced california source bait fishermen12 animals also frequently transported areas humans escapes resulted several successful introductions feral cats parrots
many plants introduced intent aesthetically improving public recreation areas private properties introduced norway maple example occupies prominent status many canadas parks13 transport ornamental plants landscaping continues source many introductions species escaped horticultural control become invasive notable examples include water hyacinth salt cedar purple loosestrife
cases species translocated reasons cultural nostalgia refers instances humans migrated regions intentionally brought familiar organisms famous examples include introduction starlings north america englishman eugene schieffelin lover works shakespeare chairman american acclimatization society rumoured wanted introduce birds mentioned shakespeares plays united states deliberately released eighty starlings central park york city 1890 another forty 1891
another prominent example introduced species became invasive european rabbit australia thomas austin british landowner rabbits released estate victoria missed hunting recent example introduction common wall lizard north america cincinnati george around 1950 family vacation italy14
addressing environmental problemsedit
intentional introductions also undertaken ameliorating environmental problems number fast spreading plants kudzu introduced means erosion control species introduced biological control agents control invasive species involves purposeful introduction natural enemy target species intention reducing numbers controlling spread
special case introduction reintroduction species become locally endangered extinct done interests conservation15 examples successful reintroductions include wolves yellowstone national park kite parts england scotland introductions translocations species also proposed interest genetic conservation advocates introduction individuals genetically depauperate populations endangered threatened species16
examples highlight intent humans introduce species means incurring benefit benefits cases realized introductions also resulted unforeseen costs particularly introduced species take characteristics invasive species
unintentional introductionsedit
unintentional introductions occur species transported human vectors increasing rates human travel providing accelerating opportunities species accidentally transported areas considered native example three species black norway polynesian spread world hitchhikers ships also numerous examples marine organisms transported ballast water zebra mussel species introduced francisco manner making heavily invaded estuary world17 also accidental release africanized honey bees known colloquially killer bees africanized brazil 1957 asian carps united states insect commonly known brown marmorated stink halyomorpha halys introduced accidentally pennsylvania another form unintentional introductions intentionally introduced plant carries parasite herbivore become invasive example oleander aphid accidentally introduced ornamental plant oleander
accidentally intentionally introduced species become invasive ones mentioned instance coccinellid species introduced canada nonnative species become established handful considered invasive including intentionally introduced harmonia axyridis multicolored asian lady beetle18 however small percentage introduced species become invasive produce profound ecological changes north america harmonia axyridis become abundant lady beetle probably accounts observations native lady beetles together19
introduced plantsedit
many nonnative plants introduced territories initially either ornamental plants erosion control stock feed forestry whether exotic become invasive species seldom understood beginning many nonnative ornamentals languish trade years suddenly naturalizing becoming invasive
peaches example originated china carried much populated world tomatoes native andes squash pumpkins maize corn tobacco native americas introduced world many introduced species require continued human intervention survive environment others become feral seriously compete natives simply increase biodiversity area
dandelions also introduced species north america
troublesome marine species southern europe seaweed caulerpa taxifolia caulerpa first observed mediterranean 1984 coast monaco 1997 covered strong potential overgrow natural biotopes represents major risk sublittoral ecosystems origin alga mediterranean thought either migration suez canal accidental introduction aquarium another troublesome plant species terrestrial plant phyla canescens intentionally introduced many countries north america europe africa ornamental plant2021 species become invasive australia threatens native rare plants causes erosion soil slumping around river banks22 also become invasive france listed invasive plant species concern mediterranean region form monocultures threaten critical conservation habitats23

introduced animalsedit
bear mind introduced species become invasive examples introduced animals become invasive include gypsy moth eastern north america zebra mussel alewife great lakes canada goose gray squirrel europe muskrat europe asia cane toad australia nutria north america eurasia africa common brushtail possum zealand taiwan success introduced bird species related native range size body size larger species larger native range sizes found larger introduced range sizes24
commonly introduced speciesedit
species brown house sparrow ringnecked pheasant european starling introduced widely addition agricultural species frequently become feral include rabbits dogs goats fish pigs cats
geneticsedit
species introduced species could potentially breed members native species producing hybrids effect creating hybrids range little effect negative effect devastating effects native species potential negative effects include hybrids less environment resulting population decrease seen atlantic salmon population high levels escape atlantic salmon farms wild populations resulted hybrids reduced survival25 potential positive effects include adding genetic diversity population increase adaptation ability population increase number healthy individuals within population seen introduction guppies trinidad encourage population growth introduce alleles population results introduction included increased levels heterozygosity larger population size26
