historyedit
written richard stallman 1989 programs released part project original based unification similar licenses used early versions emacs 198516 debugger compiler17 licenses contained similar provisions modern specific program rendering incompatible despite license18 stallmans goal produce license could used project thus making possible many projects share code
second version license version released 1991 following years members free software community became concerned problems gplv2 license could someone exploit gpllicensed software ways contrary licenses intent19 problems included tivoization inclusion gpllicensed software hardware refuses modified versions software compatibility issues similar affero general public license—and patent deals microsoft distributors free open source software viewed attempt patents weapon free software community
version developed attempt address concerns officially released june 200720
version 1edit
version gpl21 released february 198922 prevented main ways software distributors restricted freedoms define free software first problem distributors publish binary files only—executable readable modifiable humans prevent gplv1 stated copying distributing copies portion program must also make humanreadable source code available licensing terms23
second problem distributors might restrictions either license combining software software restrictions distribution union sets restrictions would apply combined work thus adding unacceptable restrictions prevent gplv1 stated modified versions whole distributed terms gplv124 therefore software distributed terms gplv1 could combined software permissive terms would change terms whole could distributed however software distributed gplv1 could combined software distributed restrictive license would conflict requirement whole distributable terms gplv1
version 2edit
according richard stallman major change gplv2 liberty death clause calls it18 section section says licensees distribute gplcovered work satisfy licenses obligations despite legal obligations might words obligations license severed conflicting obligations provision intended discourage party using patent infringement claim litigation impair users freedom license18
1990 becoming apparent less restrictive license would strategically useful library software libraries essentially existing proprietary ones25 version gplv2 released june 1991 therefore second license library general public license introduced time numbered version show complementary version numbers diverged 1999 version lgpl released renamed lesser general public license reflect place philosophy
commonly gplv2 later version stated users license allow upgrading gplv3

late 2005 free software foundation announced work version gplv3 january 2006 first discussion draft gplv3 published public consultation began public consultation originally planned nine fifteen months finally stretched eighteen months four drafts published official gplv3 released june 2007 gplv3 written richard stallman legal counsel eben moglen richard fontana software freedom center262728
according stallman important changes relation software patents free software license compatibility definition source code hardware restrictions software modification tivoization2629 changes relate internationalization license violations handled additional permissions granted copyright holder

licensed softwareedit
software purposes including commercial purposes even tool creating proprietary software example using gpllicensed compilers54 users companies distribute gpllicensed works software charge copies give free charge distinguishes shareware software licenses allow copying personal prohibit commercial distribution proprietary licenses copying prohibited copyright argues freedomrespecting free software also restrict commercial distribution including redistribution53
purely private internal use—with sales distribution—the software code modified parts reused without requiring source code released sales distribution entire source code need made available users including code changes additions—in case copyleft applied ensure users retain freedoms defined above55
however software running application program gpllicensed operating system linux required licensed distributed sourcecode availability—the licensing depends used libraries software components underlying platform56 example program consists original custom software combined source code software components57 custom software components need licensed need make code available even underlying operating system used licensed applications running considered derivative works56 gpled parts used program program distributed source code program needs made available license terms lesser general public license lgpl created weaker copyleft require customdeveloped source code distinct lgpled parts made available license terms
copyleftedit
main article copyleft
distribution rights granted modified versions work unconditional someone distributes gpld work plus hisher modifications requirements distributing whole work cannot greater requirements
requirement known copyleft earns legal power copyright software programs work copyrighted licensee right redistribute even modified form barring fair except terms license required adhere terms wishes exercise rights normally restricted copyright redistribution conversely distributes copies work without abiding terms instance keeping source code secret sued original author copyright
copyleft thus uses copyright accomplish opposite usual purpose instead imposing restrictions grants rights people ensures rights cannot subsequently taken away also ensures unlimited redistribution rights granted legal flaw found copyleft statementcitation needed
many distributors gpled programs bundle source code executables alternative method satisfying copyleft provide written offer provide source code physical medium upon request practice many gpled programs distributed internet source code made available http internet distribution complies license
copyleft applies person seeks redistribute program developers make private modified versions obligation divulge modifications long distribute modified software anyone else note copyleft applies software output unless output derivative work program58 example public portal running modified derivative gpled content management system required distribute changes underlying software output derivative
debate whether violation release source code obfuscated form cases author less willing make source code available consensus unethical considered violation issue clarified license altered require preferred version source code made available59
license versus contractedit
designed license rather contract6061 common jurisdictions legal distinction license contract important contracts enforceable contract whereas licenses enforced copyright however distinction useful many jurisdictions differences contracts licenses civil systems62
accept gpls terms conditions permission copyright copy distribute licensed software derivative works however redistribute gpld program still software within organization however like works including programs constructed program required covered license
allison randal argued gplv3 license unnecessarily confusing readers could simplified retaining conditions legal force63
april 2017 federal court ruled opensource license enforceable contract64
derivationsedit
text copyrighted copyright held free software foundation

licenses created project include lesser general public license free documentation license affero general public license

linking derived worksedit
librariesedit
according require release modified version part free make modifications privately without ever releasing them68 however releases gpllicensed entity public issue regarding linking namely whether proprietary program uses library violation
dispute whether nongpl software legally statically link dynamically link libraries different opinions exist issue clear requiring derivative works code must ambiguity arises regards using libraries bundling software larger package perhaps mixed binary static linking ultimately question copyright defines derivative works following points view exist
point view dynamic static linking violate gpledit
free software foundation holds copyright several notable gpllicensed software products license text asserts executable uses dynamically linked library indeed derivative work however apply separate programs communicating another69
free software foundation also created lgpl nearly identical additional permissions allow linking purposes using library
richard stallman specifically encourage librarywriters license proprietary programs cannot libraries effort protect freesoftware world giving tools proprietary world70
point view static linking violates unclear dynamic linkingedit
people believe static linking produces derivative works clear whether executable dynamically links code considered derivative work weak copyleft linux author linus torvalds agrees dynamic linking create derived works disagrees circumstances71
novell lawyer written dynamic linking derivative makes sense clearcut evidence goodintentioned dynamic linking seen existence proprietary linux kernel drivers72
galoob nintendo united states ninth circuit court appeals defined derivative work form permanence noted infringing work must incorporate portion copyrighted work form73 clear court decisions resolve particular conflict
point view linking irrelevantedit
according article linux journal lawrence rosen onetime open source initiative general counsel argues method linking mostly irrelevant question whether piece software derivative work important question whether software intended interface client software andor libraries74 states primary indication whether program derivative work whether source code original program used copypaste sense modified translated otherwise changed create program would argue derivative work74 lists numerous points regarding intent bundling linkage mechanism argues firms website75 marketbased factors important linking technique
also specific issue whether plugin module nvidia graphics card kernel modules must also could reasonably considered work point view suggests reasonably separate plugins plugins software designed plugins could licensed arbitrary license work gplv2 particular interest gplv2 paragraph

modify copy copies program portion thus forming work based program copy distribute modifications work terms section provided also meet conditions
must cause work distribute publish whole part contains derived program part thereof licensed whole charge third parties terms license requirements apply modified work whole identifiable sections work derived program reasonably considered independent separate works license terms apply sections distribute separate works distribute sections part whole work based program distribution whole must terms license whose permissions licensees extend entire whole thus every part regardless wrote

gplv3 different clause

convey work based program modifications produce program form source code terms section provided also meet conditions
must license entire work whole license anyone comes possession copy license therefore apply along applicable section additional terms whole work parts regardless packaged license gives permission license work invalidate permission separately received compilation covered work separate independent works nature extensions covered work combined form larger program volume storage distribution medium called aggregate compilation resulting copyright used limit access legal rights compilations users beyond individual works permit inclusion covered work aggregate cause license apply parts aggregate

case study supposedly proprietary plugins themesskins gplv2 software drupal wordpress come fire sides argument taken7677
differentiates plugin invoked plugin invoked dynamic linkage performs function calls program likely derivative work78
communicating bundling nongpl programsedit
mere communicating programs require software distributing software nongpl software however minor conditions must followed ensures rights software restricted following quote gnuorg describes extent software allowed communicate bebundledwith programs79

difference aggregate kinds modified versions
aggregate consists number separate programs distributed together cdrom media permits create distribute aggregate even licenses software nonfree gplincompatible condition cannot release aggregate license prohibits users exercising rights programs individual license would grant
wheres line separate programs program parts legal question ultimately judges decide believe proper criterion depends mechanism communication exec pipes function calls within shared address space semantics communication kinds information interchanged
modules included executable file definitely combined program modules designed linked together shared address space almost surely means combining program
contrast pipes sockets commandline arguments communication mechanisms normally used separate programs used communication modules normally separate programs semantics communication intimate enough exchanging complex internal data structures could basis consider parts combined larger program

thus draws line library program complexity intimacy information exchange mechanism rather semantics resigns question clearcut complex situations case decide
