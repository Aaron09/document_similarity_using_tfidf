fossilization processes

process fossilization varies according tissue type external conditions
permineralization




silicified replaced silica fossils road canyon formation middle permian texas


permineralization process fossilization occurs organism buried empty spaces within organism spaces filled liquid life become filled mineralrich groundwater minerals precipitate groundwater occupying empty spaces process occur small spaces within cell wall plant cell small scale permineralization produce detailed fossils permineralization occur organism must become covered sediment soon death soon initial decay process degree remains decayed covered determines later details fossil fossils consist skeletal remains teeth fossils contain traces skin feathers even soft tissues form diagenesis
casts molds





external mold bivalve logan formation lower carboniferous ohio


cases original remains organism completely dissolve otherwise destroyed remaining organismshaped hole rock called external mold hole later filled minerals cast endocast internal mold formed sediments minerals fill internal cavity organism inside bivalve snail hollow skull
authigenic mineralization
special form cast mold formation chemistry right organism fragment organism nucleus precipitation minerals siderite resulting nodule forming around happens rapidly significant decay organic tissue fine threedimensional morphological detail preserved nodules carboniferous mazon creek fossil beds illinois among best documented examples mineralization
replacement recrystallization




recrystallized scleractinian coral aragonite calcite jurassic southern israel


replacement occurs shell bone tissue replaced another mineral cases mineral replacement original shell occurs gradually fine scales microstructural features preserved despite total loss original material shell said recrystallized original skeletal compounds still present different crystal form aragonite calcite
adpression compressionimpression

carbonization
carbonaceous films thin coatings consist predominantly chemical element carbon soft tissues organisms made largely organic carbon compounds diagenesis reducing conditions thin film carbon residue left forms silhouette original organism
bioimmuration




starshaped holes catellocaula vallata upper ordovician bryozoan represent softbodied organism preserved bioimmuration bryozoan skeleton16


bioimmuration occurs skeletal organism overgrows otherwise subsumes another organism preserving latter impression within skeleton17 usually sessile skeletal organism bryozoan oyster grows along substrate covering sessile sclerobionts sometimes bioimmured organism softbodied preserved negative relief kind external mold also cases organism settles living skeletal organism grows upwards preserving settler skeleton bioimmuration known fossil record ordovician18 recent17

paleontology seeks life evolved across geologic time substantial hurdle difficulty working fossil ages beds preserve fossils typically lack radioactive elements needed radiometric dating technique means giving rocks greater million years absolute accurate within better19 although radiometric dating requires careful laboratory work basic principle simple rates various radioactive elements decay known ratio radioactive element decay products shows long radioactive element incorporated rock radioactive elements common rocks volcanic origin fossilbearing rocks dated radiometrically volcanic layers provide termini intervening sediments19
stratigraphy
consequently palaeontologists rely stratigraphy date fossils stratigraphy science deciphering layercake sedimentary record20 rocks normally form relatively horizontal layers layer younger underneath fossil found layers whose ages known fossils claimed known ages21 rock sequences continuous broken faults periods erosion difficult match rock beds directly adjacent however fossils species survived relatively short time used match isolated rocks technique called biostratigraphy instance conodont eoplacognathus pseudoplanus short range middle ordovician period22 rocks unknown traces pseudoplanus midordovician index fossils must distinctive globally distributed occupy short time range useful misleading results produced index fossils incorrectly dated23 stratigraphy biostratigraphy general provide relative dating often sufficient studying evolution however difficult time periods problems involved matching rocks across continents24 familytree relationships also help narrow date lineages first appeared instance fossils date million years calculated family tree says ancestor must evolved earlier
also possible estimate long living clades diverged approximately long last common ancestor must lived assuming mutations accumulate constant rate molecular clocks however fallible provide approximate timing example sufficiently precise reliable estimating groups feature cambrian explosion first evolved25 estimates produced different techniques vary factor two26
