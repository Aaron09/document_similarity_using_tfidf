general characteristicsedit
inflorescences described many different characteristics including flowers arranged peduncle blooming order flowers different clusters flowers grouped within terms general representations plants nature combination types
bractsedit
inflorescences usually modified shoots foliage different vegetative part plant considering broadest meaning term leaf associated inflorescence called bract bract usually located node main stem inflorescence forms joined main stem plant bracts exist within inflorescence serve variety functions include attracting pollinators protecting young flowers according presence absence bracts characteristics distinguish

ebracteate inflorescences bracts inflorescence
bracteate inflorescences bracts inflorescence specialised sometimes reduced small scales divided dissected
leafy inflorescences though often reduced size bracts unspecialised look like typical leaves plant term flowering stem usually applied instead inflorescence technically correct despite normal appearance leaves considered fact bracts leafy inflorescence preferable
leafybracted inflorescences intermediate bracteate leafy inflorescence

many bracts present strictly connected stem like family asteraceae bracts might collectively called involucre inflorescence second unit bracts stem might called involucel

terminal floweredit
plant organs grow according different schemes namely monopodial racemose sympodial cymose inflorescences different growth patterns called indeterminate determinate respectively indicate whether terminal flower formed flowering starts within inflorescence

indeterminate inflorescence monopodial racemose growth terminal keeps growing forming lateral flowers terminal flower never formed
determinate inflorescence sympodial cymose growth terminal forms terminal flower dies flowers grow lateral buds

indeterminate determinate inflorescences sometimes referred open closed inflorescences respectively
indeterminate inflorescence true terminal flower stem usually rudimentary many cases last true flower formed terminal subterminal flower straightens appearing terminal flower often vestige terminal noticed higher stem







indeterminate inflorescence perfect acropetal maturation

determinate inflorescences terminal flower usually first mature precursive development others tend mature starting bottom stem pattern called acropetal maturation flowers start mature stem maturation basipetal central mature first divergent

phyllotaxisedit
leaves flowers arranged stem according many different patterns phyllotaxis indepth descriptions







alternate flowers









opposite flowers




similarly arrangement leaf called ptyxis
metatopyedit
metatopy placement organs normally expected position typically metatopy occurs inflorescences unequal growth rates alter different areas axis organs attached axis
single cluster flowers located axil bract location bract relation stem holding flowers indicated different terms useful diagnostic indicator
typical placement bracts include

plants bracts subtend inflorescence flowers branched stalks bracts connected stalks holding flowers adnate attached main stem adnate describes fusing together different unrelated parts parts fused together connately joined
plants bracts subtend pedicel peduncle single flowers

metatopic placement bracts include

bract attached stem holding flower pedicel peduncle said recaulescent sometimes bracts bracteoles highly modified appear appendages flower calyx recaulescences fusion subtending leaf stem holding itself1 thus leaf bract adnate stem flower
