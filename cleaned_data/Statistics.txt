overviewedit
applying statistics problem common practice start population process studied populations diverse topics persons living country every atom composing crystal
ideally statisticians compile data entire population operation called census organized governmental statistical institutes descriptive statistics used summarize population data numerical descriptors include mean standard deviation continuous data types like income frequency percentage useful terms describing categorical data like race
census feasible chosen subset population called sample studied sample representative population determined data collected sample members observational experimental setting descriptive statistics used summarize sample data however drawing sample subject element randomness hence established numerical descriptors sample also uncertainty still draw meaningful conclusions entire population inferential statistics needed uses patterns sample data draw inferences population represented accounting randomness inferences take form answering yesno questions data hypothesis testing estimating numerical characteristics data estimation describing associations within data correlation modeling relationships within data example using regression analysis inference extend forecasting prediction estimation unobserved values either associated population studied include extrapolation interpolation time series spatial data also include data mining
data collectionedit
samplingedit
full census data cannot collected statisticians collect sample data developing specific experiment designs survey samples statistics also provides tools prediction forecasting statistical models
sample guide entire population important truly represents overall population representative sampling assures inferences conclusions safely extend sample population whole major problem lies determining extent sample chosen actually representative statistics offers methods estimate correct bias within sample data collection procedures also methods experimental design experiments lessen issues outset study strengthening capability discern truths population
sampling theory part mathematical discipline probability theory probability used mathematical statistics study sampling distributions sample statistics generally properties statistical procedures statistical method valid system population consideration satisfies assumptions method difference point view classic probability theory sampling theory roughly probability theory starts given parameters total population deduce probabilities pertain samples statistical inference however moves opposite directionâ€”inductively inferring samples parameters larger total population
experimental observational studiesedit
common goal statistical research project investigate causality particular draw conclusion effect changes values predictors independent variables dependent variables major types causal statistical studies experimental studies observational studies types studies effect differences independent variable variables behavior dependent variable observed difference types lies study actually conducted effective experimental study involves taking measurements system study manipulating system taking additional measurements using procedure determine manipulation modified values measurements contrast observational study involve experimental manipulation instead data gathered correlations predictors response investigated tools data analysis work best data randomized studies also applied kinds data like natural experiments observational studies13 statistician would modified structured estimation method difference differences estimation instrumental variables among many others produce consistent estimators
experimentsedit
basic steps statistical experiment

planning research including finding number replicates study using following information preliminary estimates regarding size treatment effects alternative hypotheses estimated experimental variability consideration selection experimental subjects ethics research necessary statisticians recommend experiments compare least treatment standard treatment control allow unbiased estimate difference treatment effects
design experiments using blocking reduce influence confounding variables randomized assignment treatments subjects allow unbiased estimates treatment effects experimental error stage experimenters statisticians write experimental protocol guide performance experiment specifies primary analysis experimental data
performing experiment following experimental protocol analyzing data following experimental protocol
examining data secondary analyses suggest hypotheses future study
documenting presenting results study

experiments human behavior special concerns famous hawthorne study examined changes working environment hawthorne plant western electric company researchers interested determining whether increased illumination would increase productivity assembly line workers researchers first measured productivity plant modified illumination area plant checked changes illumination affected productivity turned productivity indeed improved experimental conditions however study heavily criticized today errors experimental procedures specifically lack control group blindness hawthorne effect refers finding outcome case worker productivity changed observation hawthorne study became productive lighting changed observed14

types dataedit
main articles statistical data type levels measurement
various attempts made produce taxonomy levels measurement psychophysicist stanley smith stevens defined nominal ordinal interval ratio scales nominal measurements meaningful rank order among values permit onetoone transformation ordinal measurements imprecise differences consecutive values meaningful order values permit orderpreserving transformation interval measurements meaningful distances measurements defined zero value arbitrary case longitude temperature measurements celsius fahrenheit permit linear transformation ratio measurements meaningful zero value distances different measurements defined permit rescaling transformation

terminology theory inferential statisticsedit
statistics estimators pivotal quantitiesedit
consider independent identically distributed random variables given probability distribution standard statistical inference estimation theory defines random sample random vector given column vector variables21 population examined described probability distribution unknown parameters
statistic random variable function random sample function unknown parameters probability distribution statistic though unknown parameters
consider function unknown parameter estimator statistic used estimate function commonly used estimators include sample mean unbiased sample variance sample covariance
random variable function random sample unknown parameter whose probability distribution depend unknown parameter called pivotal quantity pivot widely used pivots include zscore square statistic students tvalue
estimators given parameter lower mean squared error said efficient furthermore estimator said unbiased expected value equal true value unknown parameter estimated asymptotically unbiased expected value converges limit true value parameter
desirable properties estimators include umvue estimators lowest variance possible values parameter estimated usually easier property verify efficiency consistent estimators converges probability true value parameter
still leaves question obtain estimators given situation carry computation several methods proposed method moments maximum likelihood method least squares method recent method estimating equations
null hypothesis alternative hypothesisedit
interpretation statistical information often involve development null hypothesis usually necessarily relationship exists among variables change occurred time2223
best illustration novice predicament encountered criminal trial null hypothesis asserts defendant innocent whereas alternative hypothesis asserts defendant guilty indictment comes suspicion guilt status stands opposition maintained unless supported evidence beyond reasonable doubt however failure reject case imply innocence merely evidence insufficient convict jury necessarily accept fails reject prove null hypothesis test close true power test tests type errors
statisticians call alternative hypothesis simply hypothesis contradicts null hypothesis
erroredit
working null hypothesis basic forms error recognized

type errors null hypothesis falsely rejected giving false positive
type errors null hypothesis fails rejected actual difference populations missed giving false negative

standard deviation refers extent individual observations sample differ central value sample population mean standard error refers estimate difference sample mean population mean
statistical error amount observation differs expected value residual amount observation differs value estimator expected value assumes given sample also called prediction
mean squared error used obtaining efficient estimators widely used class estimators root mean square error simply square root mean squared error




least squares points fitted blue fitted line


many statistical methods seek minimize residual squares called methods least squares contrast least absolute deviations latter gives equal weight small errors former gives weight large errors residual squares also differentiable provides handy property regression least squares applied linear regression called ordinary least squares method least squares applied nonlinear regression called nonlinear least squares also linear regression model deterministic part model called error term disturbance simply noise linear regression nonlinear regression addressed polynomial least squares also describes variance prediction dependent variable axis function independent variable axis deviations errors noise disturbances estimated fitted curve
measurement processes generate statistical data also subject error many errors classified random noise systematic bias types errors blunder analyst reports incorrect units also important presence missing data censoring result biased estimates specific techniques developed address problems24
interval estimationedit
main article interval estimation




confidence intervals line true value mean example blue lines random confidence intervals realizations


studies sample part population results dont fully represent whole population estimates obtained sample approximate population value confidence intervals allow statisticians express closely sample estimate matches true value whole population often expressed confidence intervals formally confidence interval value range sampling analysis repeated conditions yielding different dataset interval would include true population value possible cases imply probability true value confidence interval frequentist perspective claim even make sense true value random variable either true value within given interval however true data sampled given plan construct confidence interval probability yettobecalculated interval cover true value point limits interval yettobeobserved random variables approach yield interval interpreted given probability containing true value credible interval bayesian statistics approach depends different interpreting meant probability bayesian probability
principle confidence intervals symmetrical asymmetrical interval asymmetrical works lower upper bound parameter leftsided interval right sided interval also asymmetrical sided interval built violating symmetry around estimate sometimes bounds confidence interval reached asymptotically used approximate true bounds
significanceedit
main article statistical significance
statistics rarely give simple yesno type answer question analysis interpretation often comes level statistical significance applied numbers often refers probability value accurately rejecting null hypothesis sometimes referred pvalue




graph black line probability distribution test statistic critical region values right observed data point observed value test statistic pvalue represented green area


standard approach21 test null hypothesis alternative hypothesis critical region values estimator leads refuting null hypothesis probability type error therefore probability estimator belongs critical region given null hypothesis true statistical significance probability type error probability estimator doesnt belong critical region given alternative hypothesis true statistical power test probability correctly rejects null hypothesis null hypothesis false
referring statistical significance necessarily mean overall result significant real world terms example large study drug shown drug statistically significant small beneficial effect drug unlikely help patient noticeably
principle acceptable level statistical significance subject debate pvalue smallest significance level allows test reject null hypothesis logically equivalent saying pvalue probability assuming null hypothesis true observing result least extreme test statistic therefore smaller pvalue lower probability committing type error
problems usually associated framework criticism hypothesis testing

difference highly statistically significant still practical significance possible properly formulate tests account response involves going beyond reporting significance level include pvalue reporting whether hypothesis rejected accepted pvalue however indicate size importance observed effect also seem exaggerate importance minor differences large studies better increasingly common approach report confidence intervals although produced calculations hypothesis tests pvalues describe size effect uncertainty surrounding
fallacy transposed conditional prosecutors fallacy criticisms arise hypothesis testing approach forces hypothesis null hypothesis favored since evaluated probability observed result given null hypothesis probability null hypothesis given observed result alternative approach offered bayesian inference although requires establishing prior probability25
rejecting null hypothesis automatically prove alternative hypothesis
everything inferential statistics relies sample size therefore tails pvalues seriously miscomputedclarification needed
