viruses semen
twentyseven different viruses identified semen information whether transmission occurs whether viruses cause disease uncertain microbes known sexually transmitted74 found semen listed cdc74
microbes known sexually transmissible generally considered stdsstis include

marburg virus virus semen seven weeks clinical recovery75
htlv types sexually transmissible consumption breast milk breastfeeding mistaken risk leukemia76

pathophysiology
many stis easily transmitted mucous membranes penis vulva rectum urinary tract less often—depending type infection mouth throat respiratory tract eyes77 visible membrane covering head penis mucous membrane though produces mucus similar lips mouth mucous membranes differ skin allow certain pathogens body amount contact infective sources causes infection varies pathogen cases disease result even light contact fluid carriers like venereal fluids onto mucous membranescitation needed
stis transmitted mother child either pregnancy breastfeedingcitation needed
healthcare professionals suggest safer condoms reliable decreasing risk contracting sexually transmitted diseases sexual activity safer cannot considered provide complete protection transfer exposure bodily fluids blood transfusions blood products sharing injection needles needlestick injuries medical staff inadvertently jabbed pricked needles medical procedures sharing tattoo needles childbirth avenues transmission different means certain groups medical workers haemophiliacs drug users particularly riskcitation needed
possible asymptomatic carrier sexually transmitted diseases particular sexually transmitted diseases women often cause serious condition pelvic inflammatory diseasecitation needed
prevention
main article safe
centers disease control prevention strategies reducing risk include vaccination mutual monogamy reducing number sexual partners abstinence78
effective prevent sexual transmission stis avoid contact body parts fluids lead transfer infected partner sexual activities involve contact cybersex phonesex masturbation distance methods avoiding contact proper condoms reduces contact risk although condom effective limiting exposure disease transmission occur even condom79
partners tested stis initiating sexual contact resuming contact partner engaged contact someone else many infections detectable immediately exposure enough time must allowed possible exposures testing tests accurate certain stis particularly certain persistent viruses like impossible detect current medical proceduresmedical citation needed
treatment facilities utilize inhome test kits person return test followup facilities strongly encourage previously infected return ensure infection eliminated novel strategies foster retesting text messaging email reminders types reminders used addition phone calls letters80 obtaining sexual history healthcare provider encourage risk reduction providing prevention counseling prevention counseling effective provided nonjudgmental empathetic manner appropriate persons culture language gender sexual orientation developmental level prevention counseling stis usually offered sexually active adolescents adults received diagnosis past year multiple partners81
uspstf recommends highintensity behavioral counseling sexually active adolescents adults increased risk stis interactive counseling resource intensive directed persons risk situations risk occurs personalized goalsetting strategies81
vaccines
vaccines available protect viral stis hepatitis hepatitis types hpv82 vaccination initiation sexual contact advised assure maximal protection development vaccines protect gonorrhea ongoing83
condoms
condoms female condoms provide protection used properly barrier area cover uncovered areas still susceptible many stiscitation needed
case sexual transmission routes almost always involve penis cannot spread unbroken skin therefore properly shielding penis properly worn condom vagina anus effectively stops transmission infected fluid broken skin borne direct transmission would considered sexually transmitted still theoretically occur sexual contact avoided simply engaging sexual contact presenting open bleeding woundscitation needed
stis even viral infections prevented latex polyurethane polyisoprene condoms barrier microorganisms viruses small enough pass pores natural skin condoms still large pass latex synthetic condomscitation needed
proper male condom usage entailscitation needed

putting condom tight leaving centimetres room ejaculation putting condom snug often leads failure
wearing condom loose defeat barrier
avoiding inverting spilling condom worn whether ejaculate
user attempts unroll condom realizes wrong side condom effective
careful condom handling long nails
avoiding oilbased lubricants anything latex condoms holes
using flavored condoms oral sugar flavoring lead yeast infections used penetrate

order best protect oneself partner stis condom contents assumed infectious therefore condom must properly disposed condom used intercourse multiple usage increases chance breakage defeating effectiveness barriercitation needed
nonoxynol9
researchers hoped nonoxynol9 vaginal microbicide would help decrease risk trials however found ineffective84 women higher risk infection85
screening
specific groups persons participate risky sexual behavior certain health conditions require screening recommends sexually active women risk screened chlamydia gonorrhea yearly appropriate times screening regular pelvic examinations preconception evaluations86 nucleic acid amplification tests recommended method diagnosis gonorrhea chlamydia87 done either urine women vaginal cervical swabs women urethral swabs men87 screening performed

tests used number reasons

diagnostic test determine cause symptoms illness
screening test detect asymptomatic presymptomatic infections
check prospective sexual partners free disease engage without safer precautions example starting long term mutually monogamous sexual relationship fluid bonding procreation
check prior pregnancy prevent harm baby
check birth check baby caught mother
prevent infected donated blood organs
