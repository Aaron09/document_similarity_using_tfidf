modern historians conventionally regard augustus first emperor whereas julius caesar considered last dictator roman republic view origins roman writers plutarch tacitus cassius dio7 however majority roman writers including josephus pliny younger suetonius appian well ordinary people empire thought julius caesar first emperor8
roman republic certainly single title indicated individual held supreme power insofar emperor could seen english translation imperator julius caesar emperor like several roman generals instead civil wars julius caesar armies became clear certainly consensus return oldstyle monarchy period several officials bestowed equal power senate would fight another come
julius caesar augustus accumulated offices titles highest importance republic making power attached offices permanent preventing anyone similar aspirations accumulating maintaining power however julius caesar unlike without senates vote approvalcitation needed
julius caesar held republican offices consul four times dictator five times appointed dictator perpetuity dictator perpetuo pontifex maximus long period gained positions senatorial consent time assassination powerful roman world
caesar appointed adopted octavian heir caesars death octavian inherited adoptive fathers property lineage loyalty allies formal process senatorial consent increasing number titles offices accrued caesar decade caesars death octavians victory erstwhile ally mark antony actium effective opposition confirmed octavians supremacy
octavian appeared senate offered retire active politics government senate requested remain increased powers made lifelong awarding title augustus elevated divine somewhat less approaching divinity augustus stayed office death sheer breadth superior powers princeps permanent imperator romes armies guaranteed peaceful continuation nominally remained republic restoration powers senate people rome demonstration auctoritas pious respect tradition
later historians tacitus would even augustus death true restoration republic might possible instead augustus actively prepared adopted tiberius successor pleaded case senate inheritance merit senate disputed issue eventually confirmed tiberius princeps power tiberius took considerable pains observe forms daytoday substance republican government
