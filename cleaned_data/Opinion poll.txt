historyedit
first known example opinion poll local straw poll conducted pennsylvanian 1824 showing andrew jackson leading john quincy adams votes contest united states presidency since jackson popular vote state whole country straw votes gradually became popular remained local usually citywide phenomena 1916 literary digest embarked national survey partly circulationraising exercise correctly predicted woodrow wilsons election president mailing millions postcards simply counting returns literary digest correctly predicted victories warren harding 1920 calvin coolidge 1924 herbert hoover 1928 franklin roosevelt 1932
1936 million voters constituted huge sample generally affluent americans tended republican sympathies literary digest ignorant bias week election reported landon popular roosevelt time george gallup conducted smaller scientifically based survey polled demographically representative sample gallup correctly predicted roosevelts landslide victory literary digest soon went business polling started take

sample polling methodsedit




voter polling questionnaire display smithsonian institution


opinion polls many years maintained telecommunications persontoperson contact methods techniques vary though widely accepted areas years technological innovations also influenced survey methods availability electronic clipboards4 internet based polling verbal ballot processed types conducted efficiently contrasted types surveys systematics complicated matrices beyond previous orthodox procedurescitation needed
opinion polling developed popular applications popular thought although response rates surveys declined also following also differentiating results1 polling organizations angus reid public opinion yougov zogby internet surveys sample drawn large panel volunteers results weighted reflect demographics population interest contrast popular polls draw whoever wishes participate rather scientific sample population therefore generally considered professional
recently statistical learning methods proposed order exploit social media content posts microblogging platform twitter modelling predicting voting intention polls56
polls used public relations field well early 1920s public relation experts described work twoway street would present misinterpreted interests large institutions public would also gauge typically ignored interests public polls
benchmark pollsedit
benchmark poll generally first poll taken campaign often taken candidate announces office sometimes happens immediately following announcement opportunity raise funds generally short simple survey likely voters
benchmark poll serves number purposes campaign whether political campaign type campaign first gives candidate picture stand electorate campaigning takes place poll done prior announcing office candidate poll decide whether even office secondly shows weaknesses strengths main areas first electorate benchmark poll shows types voters sure sure lose everyone inbetween extremes lets campaign know voters persuadable spend limited resources effective manner second give idea messages ideas slogans strongest electorate7
brushfire pollsedit
brushfire polls polls taken period benchmark poll tracking polls number brushfire polls taken campaign determined competitive race much money campaign spend polls usually focus likely voters length survey varies number messages tested
brushfire polls used number purposes first lets candidate know made progress ballot much progress made demographics making losing ground secondly campaign test variety messages positive negative opponents lets campaign know messages work best certain demographics messages avoided campaigns often polls test possible attack messages opponent potential responses attacks campaign spend time preparing effective response likely attacks thirdly kind poll used candidates political parties convince primary challengers drop race support stronger candidate
tracking pollsedit
tracking poll rolling poll poll responses obtained number consecutive periods instance daily results calculated using moving average responses gathered fixed number recent periods example past five days8 example next calculated results data five days counting backwards next namely data data next included without data sixth
potential inaccuracyedit




2000 palm beach county voting stand ballot


polls based samples populations subject sampling error reflects effects chance uncertainty sampling process uncertainty often expressed margin error margin error usually defined radius confidence interval particular statistic survey example percent people prefer product versus product single global margin error reported survey refers maximum margin error reported percentages using full sample survey statistic percentage maximum margin error calculated radius confidence interval reported percentage others suggest poll random sample 1000 people margin sampling error estimated percentage whole population
margin error means procedure used large number times time true population average within confidence interval sample estimate plus minus margin error reduced using larger sample however pollster wishes reduce margin error would need sample around 10000 people9 practice pollsters need balance cost large sample reduction sampling error sample size around 500–1000 typical compromise political polls note complete responses necessary include thousands additional participators1011
another reduce margin error rely poll averages makes assumption procedure similar enough many different polls uses sample size poll create polling average12 example polling average found 2008 presidential election polling average another source error stems faulty demographic models pollsters weigh samples particular variables party identification election example assume breakdown population party identification changed since previous presidential election underestimate victory defeat particular party candidate surge decline party registration relative previous presidential election cycle
caution estimate trend subject larger error estimate level estimates change difference numbers contend errors rough guide change measurement falls outside margin error worth attention
time number theories mechanisms offered explain erroneous polling results reflect errors part pollsters many statistical nature others blame respondents giving candid answers bradley effect tory factor controversial
nonresponse biasedit
since people answer calls strangers refuse answer poll poll samples representative samples population nonresponse bias response rates declining recent years13 selection bias characteristics agree interviewed markedly different decline actual sample biased version universe pollster wants analyze cases bias introduces errors addition errors caused sample size error bias become smaller larger sample sizes taking larger sample size simply repeats mistake larger scale people refuse answer never reached characteristics people answer final results unbiased people answer different opinions bias results terms election polls studies suggest bias effects small polling firm techniques adjusting weights minimize selection bias1415
response biasedit
survey results affected response bias answers given respondents reflect true beliefs deliberately engineered unscrupulous pollsters order generate certain result please clients often result detailed wording ordering questions respondents deliberately manipulate outcome poll advocating extreme position actually hold order boost side argument give rapid illconsidered answers order hasten questioning respondents also feel social pressure give unpopular answer example respondents might unwilling admit unpopular attitudes like racism sexism thus polls might reflect true incidence attitudes population american political parlance phenomenon often referred bradley effect results surveys widely publicized effect magnified phenomenon commonly referred spiral silence
plurality voting system select candidate poll puts unintentional bias poll since people favor candidate cannot indicate fact must choose candidate biases poll causing favor candidate different others disfavors candidates similar candidates plurality voting system also biases elections
wording questionsedit
well established wording questions order asked number form alternative answers offered influence results polls instance public likely indicate support person described operator leading candidates support overrides subtle bias candidate lumping candidates category vice versa thus comparisons polls often boil wording question issues question wording result quite pronounced differences surveys1617 also however result legitimately conflicted feelings evolving attitudes rather poorly constructed survey18
common technique control bias rotate order questions asked many pollsters also splitsample involves different versions question version presented half respondents
effective controls used attitude researchers

asking enough questions allow aspects issue covered control effects form question positive negative wording adequacy number established quantitatively psychometric measures reliability coefficients
analyzing results psychometric techniques synthesize answers reliable scores detect ineffective questions

controls widely used polling industrywhy however important questions test product high quality survey methodologists work methods test empirical tests provide insight quality questionnaire complex others instance testing questionnaire done

conducting cognitive interviewing asking sample potentialrespondents interpretation questions questionnaire researcher
carrying small pretest questionnaire using small subset target respondents results inform researcher errors missing questions logical procedural errors
estimating measurement quality questions done instance using testretest19 quasisimplex20 mutlitraitmultimethod models21
predicting measurement quality question done using software survey quality predictor sqp22

coverage biasedit
another source error samples representative population consequence methodology used experience literary digest 1936 example telephone sampling builtin error many times places telephones generally richer without
places many people mobile telephones pollsters cannot automated dialing machines call mobile phones united states phones owner charged taking call23 individuals typically excluded polling samples concern subset population without cell phones differs markedly rest population differences skew results poll24
polling organizations developed many weighting techniques help overcome deficiencies varying degrees success studies mobile phone users research center 2007 concluded cellonly respondents different landline respondents important ways neither numerous enough different enough questions examined produce significant change overall general population survey estimates included landline samples weighted according census parameters basic demographic characteristics25
issue first identified 200426 came prominence 2008 presidential election27 previous elections proportion general population using cell phones small proportion increased concern polling landlines longer representative general population 2003 households wireless cellphones compared 200628 results coverage error many polling organisations select sample dialling random telephone numbers however 2008 clear tendency polls included mobile phones samples show much larger lead obama polls not2930
potential sources bias are31

households cellphones landline tends include minorities younger voters occurs frequently metropolitan areas likely cellphoneonly compared women
people contactable landline monday friday contactable cellphone
people landlines access internet answer calls cellphones

polling companies attempted around problem including cellphone supplement number problems including cellphones telephone poll

difficult cooperation cellphone users many parts users charged outgoing incoming calls means pollsters offer financial compensation gain cooperation
federal prohibits automated dialling devices call cellphones telephone consumer protection 1991 numbers therefore dialled hand timeconsuming expensive pollsters

oftquoted example opinion polls succumbing errors occurred 1992 general election despite polling organizations using different methodologies virtually polls taken vote lesser extent exit polls taken voting showed lead opposition labour party actual vote gave clear victory ruling conservative party
deliberations embarrassment pollsters advanced several ideas account errors including

late swing
voters changed minds shortly voting tended favour conservatives error great first appeared
nonresponse bias
conservative voters less likely participate surveys past thus underrepresented
tory factor
conservatives suffered sustained period unpopularity result economic difficulties series minor scandals leading spiral silence conservative supporters reluctant disclose sincere intentions pollsters

relative importance factors remains matter controversy since polling organizations adjusted methodologies achieved accurate results subsequent election campaignscitation needed
comprehensive discussion biases understood mitigated included several sources including dillman salant 199432
failuresedit
widely publicized failure opinion polling date united states prediction thomas dewey would defeat harry truman 1948 presidential election major polling organizations including gallup roper indicated landslide victory dewey
widely predicted donald trump would lose 2016 presidential election former secretary state hillary clinton however donald trump elected 45th president united states inaugurated january 2017 many publications fivethirtyeight33 predicted otherwise
united kingdom polls failed predict conservative election victories 1970 1992 labours victory 1974 however figures elections generally accurate 2015 election virtually every poll predicted hung parliament labour conservatives neck neck actual result clear conservative majority hand 2017 opposite appears occurred polls predicted conservative landslide even though reality election resulted hung parliament conservatives losing majority
social media source opinion candidatesedit
social media today popular medium candidates campaign gauging public reaction campaigns social media also used indicator voter opinion regarding poll research studies shown predictions made using social media signals match traditional opinion polls56
recently concerning 2016 presidential election major concern effect false stories spreading throughout social media recent evidence shows social media plays huge role supplying news percent adults news social media34 fact makes issue fake news spread throughout influential evidence surrounding fake news shows popular fake news stories widely shared facebook popular mainstream news stories many people fake news stories report believe discussed fake news stories tended favor donald trump hillary clinton result facts concluded stories donald trump election hillary clinton35
influenceedit
effect votersedit
providing information voting intentions opinion polls sometimes influence behavior electors book broken compass peter hitchens asserts opinion polls actually device influencing public opinion36 various theories happens split groups bandwagonunderdog effects strategic tactical voting
bandwagon effect occurs poll prompts voters back candidate shown winning poll idea voters susceptible effects stemming least 1884 william safire reported term first used political cartoon magazine puck year37 also remained persistent spite lack empirical corroboration late 20th century george gallup spent much effort vain trying discredit theory time presenting empirical research recent metastudy scientific research topic indicates 1980s onward bandwagon effect found often researchers38
opposite bandwagon effect underdog effect often mentioned media occurs people vote sympathy party perceived losing elections less empirical evidence existence effect existence bandwagon effect38
second category theories polls directly affect voting called strategic tactical voting theory based idea voters view voting means selecting government thus sometimes choose candidate prefer ground ideology sympathy another lesspreferred candidate strategic considerations example found united kingdom general election 1997 cabinet minister michael portillos constituency enfield southgate believed safe seat opinion polls showed labour candidate stephen twigg steadily gaining support prompted undecided voters supporters parties support twigg order remove portillo another example boomerang effect likely supporters candidate shown winning feel chances slim vote required thus allowing another candidate
addition mark pickup cameron anderson laura stephensons voting behaviour canada outlines three additional behavioural responses voters exhibit faced polling data
first known taking effect holds poll data used proxy information candidates parties taking based psychological phenomenon using heuristics simplify complex decision 24339
second first described petty cacioppo 1996 known cognitive response theory theory asserts voters response poll line initial conception electoral reality response voter likely generate mental list create reasons partys loss gain polls reinforce change opinion candidate thus affect voting behaviour
third final possibility behavioural response similar cognitive response salient difference voter seek information form mental list thus becoming informed election affect voting behaviour
effects indicate opinion polls directly affect political choices electorate directly indirectly effects surveyed analyzed political parties form media framing party ideology shifts must also taken consideration opinion polling instances measure cognitive bias variably considered handled appropriately various applications
