characteristics life


since unequivocal definition life current definitions biology descriptive life considered characteristic something preserves furthers reinforces existence given environment characteristic exhibits following traits 17192021222324

homeostasis regulation internal environment maintain constant state example sweating reduce temperature
organization structurally composed cells basic units life
metabolism transformation energy converting chemicals energy cellular components anabolism decomposing organic matter catabolism living things require energy maintain internal organization homeostasis produce phenomena associated life
growth maintenance higher rate anabolism catabolism growing organism increases size parts rather simply accumulating matter
adaptation ability change time response environment ability fundamental process evolution determined organisms heredity diet external factors
response stimuli response take many forms contraction unicellular organism external chemicals complex reactions involving senses multicellular organisms response often expressed motion example leaves plant turning toward phototropism chemotaxis
reproduction ability produce individual organisms either asexually single parent organism sexually parent organisms

complex processes called physiological functions underlying physical chemical bases well signaling control mechanisms essential maintaining life
alternative definitions
also entropy life
physics perspective living beings thermodynamic systems organized molecular structure reproduce evolve survival dictates2526 thermodynamically life described open system makes gradients surroundings create imperfect copies itself27 hence life selfsustained chemical system capable undergoing darwinian evolution2829 major strength definition distinguishes life evolutionary process rather chemical composition30
others take systemic viewpoint necessarily depend molecular chemistry systemic definition life living things selforganizing autopoietic selfproducing variations definition include stuart kauffmans definition autonomous agent multiagent system capable reproducing completing least thermodynamic work cycle31 definition extended apparition novel functions time32
viruses

life property ecosystems
systems view life treats environmental fluxes biological fluxes together reciprocity influence52 reciprocal relation environment arguably important understanding life understanding ecosystems harold morowitz 1992 explains life property ecological system rather single organism species53 argues ecosystemic definition life preferable strictly biochemical physical robert ulanowicz 2009 highlights mutualism understand systemic ordergenerating behavior life ecosystems54

complex systems biology field science studies emergence complexity functional organisms viewpoint dynamic systems theory55 latter also often called systems biology aims understand fundamental aspects life closely related approach systems biology called relational biology concerned mainly understanding life processes terms important relations categories relations among essential functional components organisms multicellular organisms defined categorical biology model representation organisms category theory biological relations well algebraic topology functional organization living organisms terms dynamic complex networks metabolic genetic epigenetic processes signaling pathways5657 alternative closely related approaches focus interdependance constraints constraints either molecular enzymes macroscopic geometry bone vascular system58
darwinian dynamic
also argued evolution order living systems certain physical systems obeys common fundamental principle termed darwinian dynamic5960 darwinian dynamic formulated first considering macroscopic order generated simple nonbiological system thermodynamic equilibrium extending consideration short replicating molecules underlying ordergenerating process concluded basically similar types systems59
operator theory
another systemic definition called operator theory proposes life general term presence typical closures found organisms typical closures membrane autocatalytic cell61 organism system organisation complies operator type least complex cell62636465 life also modeled network inferior negative feedbacks regulatory mechanisms subordinated superior positive feedback formed potential expansion reproduction66

hierarchy biological classifications eight major taxonomic ranks life divided domains subdivided groups intermediate minor rankings shown


life usually classified eight levels taxa—domains kingdoms phyla class order family genus species 2016 scientists reported trillion species estimated earth currently onethousandth percent described109
first known attempt classify organisms conducted greek philosopher aristotle 384–322 classified living organisms known time either plant animal based mainly ability move also distinguished animals blood animals without blood least without blood compared concepts vertebrates invertebrates respectively divided blooded animals five groups viviparous quadrupeds mammals oviparous quadrupeds reptiles amphibians birds fishes whales bloodless animals also divided five groups cephalopods crustaceans insects included spiders scorpions centipedes addition define insects today shelled animals molluscs echinoderms zoophytes animals resemble plants though aristotles work zoology without errors grandest biological synthesis time remained ultimate authority many centuries death168
exploration americas revealed large numbers plants animals needed descriptions classification latter part 16th century beginning 17th careful study animals commenced gradually extended formed sufficient body knowledge serve anatomical basis classification late 1740s carl linnaeus introduced system binomial nomenclature classification species linnaeus attempted improve composition reduce length previously used manyworded names abolishing unnecessary rhetoric introducing descriptive terms precisely defining meaning169
fungi originally treated plants short period linnaeus classified taxon vermes animalia later placed back plantae copeland classified fungi protoctista thus partially avoiding problem acknowledging special status170 problem eventually solved whittaker gave kingdom fivekingdom system evolutionary history shows fungi closely related animals plants171
discoveries enabled detailed study cells microorganisms groups life revealed fields cell biology microbiology created organisms originally described separately protozoa animals protophytathallophyta plants united haeckel kingdom protista later prokaryotes split kingdom monera would eventually divided separate groups bacteria archaea sixkingdom system eventually current threedomain system based evolutionary relationships172 however classification eukaryotes especially protists still controversial173
microbiology molecular biology virology developed noncellular reproducing agents discovered viruses viroids whether considered alive matter debate viruses lack characteristics life cell membranes metabolism ability grow respond environments viruses still classed species based biology genetics many aspects classification remain controversial174
1960s trend called cladistics emerged arranging taxa based clades evolutionary phylogenetic tree175
