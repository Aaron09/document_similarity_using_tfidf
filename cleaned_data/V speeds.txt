definitionsedit
critical engine failure recognition speed takeoff decision speed speed takeoff continue even engine fails another problem occurs blown tire9 speed vary among aircraft types varies according factors aircraft weight runway length wing flap setting engine thrust used runway surface contamination thus must determined pilot takeoff aborting takeoff strongly discouraged aircraft definition able stop runway thus suffering runway overrun34
defined differently different jurisdictions

federal aviation administration defines maximum speed takeoff pilot must take first action apply brakes reduce thrust deploy speed brakes stop airplane within acceleratestop distance also means minimum speed takeoff following failure critical engine pilot continue takeoff achieve required height takeoff surface within takeoff distance7
transport canada defines critical engine failure recognition speed adds definition restrictive operator adopt definition outlined aircraft flight manual typeapproved aircraft long definition compromise operational safety aircraft8
