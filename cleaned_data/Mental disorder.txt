models
mental disorders arise multiple sources many cases single accepted consistent cause currently established eclectic pluralistic models used explain particular disorders4863 primary paradigm contemporary mainstream western psychiatry said biopsychosocial model incorporates biological psychological social factors although always applied practice
biological psychiatry follows biomedical model many mental disorders conceptualized disorders brain circuits likely caused developmental processes shaped complex interplay genetics experience common assumption disorders resulted genetic developmental vulnerabilities exposed stress life example diathesis–stress model although various views causes differences individuals types mental disorder viewed primarily neurodevelopmental disorders
evolutionary psychology used overall explanatory theory attachment theory another kind evolutionarypsychological approach sometimes applied context mental disorders psychoanalytic theories continued evolve alongside cognitivebehavioral systemicfamily approaches distinction sometimes made medical model social model disorder disability
diagnosis
psychiatrists seek provide medical diagnosis individuals assessment symptoms signs impairment associated particular types mental disorder mental health professionals clinical psychologists apply diagnostic categories clinical formulation clients difficulties circumstances64 majority mental health problems least initially assessed treated family physicians general practitioners consultations refer patient specialist diagnosis acute chronic cases
routine diagnostic practice mental health services typically involves interview known mental status examination evaluations made appearance behavior selfreported symptoms mental health history current life circumstances views professionals relatives third parties taken account physical examination check health effects medications drugs conducted psychological testing sometimes used paperandpen computerized questionnaires include algorithms based ticking standardized diagnostic criteria rare specialist cases neuroimaging tests requested methods commonly found research studies routine clinical practice6566
time budgetary constraints often limit practicing psychiatrists conducting thorough diagnostic evaluations67 found clinicians evaluate patients using unstructured openended approach limited training evidencebased assessment methods inaccurate diagnosis common routine practice68 addition comorbidity common psychiatric diagnosis person meets criteria disorder hand person several different difficulties meet criteria diagnosed specific problems accurate diagnosis developing countries
