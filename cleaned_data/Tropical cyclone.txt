practice using names identify tropical cyclones goes back many years systems named places things formal start naming127128 system currently used provides positive identification severe weather systems brief form readily understood recognized public127128 credit first usage personal names weather systems generally given queensland government meteorologist clement wragge named systems 1887 1907127128 system naming weather systems subsequently fell disuse several years wragge retired revived latter part world western pacific127128 formal naming schemes subsequently introduced north south atlantic eastern central western southern pacific basins well australian region indian ocean128
present tropical cyclones officially named eleven meteorological services retain names throughout lifetimes provide ease communication forecasters general public regarding forecasts watches warnings127 since systems last week longer occurring basin time names thought reduce confusion storm described127 names assigned order predetermined lists three tenminute sustained wind speeds depending basin originates394142 however standards vary basin basin tropical depressions named western pacific tropical cyclones significant amount galeforce winds occurring around center named within southern hemisphere4243 names significant tropical cyclones north atlantic ocean pacific ocean australian region retired naming lists replaced another name394043
