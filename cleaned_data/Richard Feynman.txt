feynman attended rockaway high school school rockaway queens also attended fellow nobel laureates burton richter baruch samuel blumberg16 upon starting high school feynman quickly promoted higher math class highschooladministered test estimated 125—high merely respectable according biographer james gleick1718 sister joan better allowing claim smarter years later declined join mensa international saying low19 physicist steve stated test

richard feynman nearing crest powers twentythree physicist earth could match exuberant command native materials theoretical science facility mathematics though become clear mathematical machinery emerging wheeler–feynman collaboration beyond wheelers ability feynman seemed possess frightening ease substance behind equations like albert einstein like soviet physicist landau—but others39
