evolutionedit

evolution treatment case relationships circular4pp167–174 adpositions become unstressed sound like unstressed syllable neighboring word postposition thus merge stem head noun developing various forms depending phonological shape stem affixes subject various phonological processes assimilation vowel centering schwa phoneme loss fusion processes reduce even eliminate distinctions cases languages compensate resulting loss function creating adpositions thus coming full circle
recent experiments agentbased modeling shown case systems emerge evolve population language users24 experiments demonstrate language users introduce case markers reduce cognitive effort required semantic interpretation hence facilitating communication language case markers become generalized analogical reasoning reuse
