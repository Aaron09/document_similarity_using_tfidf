delta forms river meets lake6


river deltas form river carrying sediment reaches either body water lake ocean reservoir another river cannot remove sediment quickly enough stop delta formation inland region water spreads deposits sediments tidal currents also cannot strong sediment would wash water body faster river deposits course river must carry enough sediment layer deltas time rivers velocity decreases rapidly causing deposit majority load alluvium builds form river delta7 flow enters standing water longer confined channel expands width flow expansion results decrease flow velocity diminishes ability flow transport sediment result sediment drops flow deposits time single channel builds deltaic lobe birdsfoot mississippi ural river deltas pushing mouth standing water deltaic lobe advances gradient river channel becomes lower river channel longer change elevation slope
slope river channel decreases becomes unstable reasons first gravity makes water flow direct course slope river breaches natural levees flood spills onto course shorter route ocean thereby obtaining stable steeper slope8 second slope gets lower amount shear stress decreases results deposition sediment within channel rise channel relative floodplain makes easier river breach levees channel enters body standing water steeper slope often channel flow remains abandoned channel channelswitching events occur mature delta develops distributary network
another distributary networks form deposition mouth bars midchannel sand andor gravel bars mouth river midchannel deposited mouth river flow routed around results additional deposition upstream mouthbar splits river distributary channels good example result process lake delta

wavedominated deltasedit
wave dominated deltas wavedriven sediment transport controls shape delta much sediment emanating river mouth deflected along coast line9 relationship waves river deltas quite variable largely influenced deepwater wave regimes receiving basin high wave energy near shore steeper slope offshore waves make river deltas smoother waves also responsible carrying sediments away river delta causing delta retreat5 deltas form upriver estuary complex quantifiable linkages winds tides river discharge delta water levels1213
