several signs symptoms mark onset diabetes although specific disease addition known ones include blurry vision headache fatigue slow healing cuts itchy skin prolonged high blood glucose cause glucose absorption lens leads changes shape resulting vision changes number skin rashes occur diabetes collectively known diabetic dermadromes20
diabetic emergencies
blood sugar common persons type type cases mild considered medical emergencies effects range feelings unease sweating trembling increased appetite mild cases serious issues confusion changes behavior aggressiveness seizures unconsciousness rarely permanent brain damage death severe cases2122 moderate hypoglycemia easily mistaken drunkenness23 rapid breathing sweating cold pale skin characteristic hypoglycemia definitive24 mild moderate cases selftreated eating drinking something high sugar severe cases lead unconsciousness must treated intravenous glucose injections glucagoncitation needed
people usually type also experience episodes diabetic ketoacidosis metabolic disturbance characterized nausea vomiting abdominal pain smell acetone breath deep breathing known kussmaul breathing severe cases decreased level consciousness25
rare equally severe possibility hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state common type mainly result dehydration25
complications
main article complications diabetes mellitus
forms diabetes increase risk longterm complications typically develop many years 10–20 first symptom otherwise received diagnosis time
major longterm complications relate damage blood vessels diabetes doubles risk cardiovascular disease26 deaths diabetics coronary artery disease27 macrovascular diseases stroke peripheral artery disease
primary complications diabetes damage small blood vessels include damage eyes kidneys nerves28 damage eyes known diabetic retinopathy caused damage blood vessels retina result gradual vision loss blindness28 damage kidneys known diabetic nephropathy lead tissue scarring urine protein loss eventually chronic kidney disease sometimes requiring dialysis kidney transplantation28 damage nerves body known diabetic neuropathy common complication diabetes28 symptoms include numbness tingling pain altered pain sensation lead damage skin diabetesrelated foot problems diabetic foot ulcers occur difficult treat occasionally requiring amputation additionally proximal diabetic neuropathy causes painful muscle atrophy weakness

dietary factors also influence risk developing type consumption sugarsweetened drinks excess associated increased risk4142 type fats diet also important saturated trans fats increasing risk polyunsaturated monounsaturated decreasing risk40 eating lots white rice also increase risk diabetes43 lack physical activity believed cause cases44
gestational diabetes

pathophysiology




fluctuation blood sugar sugarlowering hormone insulin blue humans course three meals effects sugarrich starchrich meal highlighted






mechanism insulin release normal pancreatic beta cells insulin production less constant within beta cells release triggered food chiefly food containing absorbable glucose


insulin principal hormone regulates uptake glucose blood cells body especially liver adipose tissue muscle except smooth muscle insulin acts igf1 therefore deficiency insulin insensitivity receptors play central role forms diabetes mellitus51
body obtains glucose three main sources intestinal absorption food breakdown glycogen storage form glucose found liver gluconeogenesis generation glucose noncarbohydrate substrates body52 insulin plays critical role balancing glucose levels body insulin inhibit breakdown glycogen process gluconeogenesis stimulate transport glucose muscle cells stimulate storage glucose form glycogen52
insulin released blood beta cells βcells found islets langerhans pancreas response rising levels blood glucose typically eating insulin used twothirds bodys cells absorb glucose blood fuel conversion needed molecules storage lower glucose levels result decreased insulin release beta cells breakdown glycogen glucose process mainly controlled hormone glucagon acts opposite manner insulin53
amount insulin available insufficient cells respond poorly effects insulin insulin insensitivity insulin resistance insulin defective glucose absorbed properly body cells require stored appropriately liver muscles effect persistently high levels blood glucose poor protein synthesis metabolic derangements acidosis52
glucose concentration blood remains high time kidneys reach threshold reabsorption glucose excreted urine glycosuria54 increases osmotic pressure urine inhibits reabsorption water kidney resulting increased urine production polyuria increased fluid loss lost blood volume replaced osmotically water held body cells body compartments causing dehydration increased thirst polydipsia52

overview management


diabetes mellitus chronic disease known cure except specific situations67 management concentrates keeping blood sugar levels close normal without causing blood sugar usually accomplished healthy diet exercise weight loss appropriate medications insulin case type diabetes oral medications well possibly insulin type diabetescitation needed
learning disease actively participating treatment important since complications less common less severe people wellmanaged blood sugar levels6869 goal treatment hba1c level lower higher70 attention also paid health problems accelerate negative effects diabetes include smoking elevated cholesterol levels obesity high blood pressure lack regular exercise70 specialized footwear widely used reduce risk ulceration reulceration atrisk diabetic feet evidence efficacy remains equivocal however71
lifestyle
also diabetic diet
people diabetes benefit education disease treatment good nutrition achieve normal body weight exercise goal keeping shortterm longterm blood glucose levels within acceptable bounds addition given associated higher risks cardiovascular disease lifestyle modifications recommended control blood pressure72
single dietary pattern best people diabetes overweight people type diabetes diet person adhere achieve weight loss effective7374
medications
also antidiabetic medication
medications used treat diabetes lowering blood sugar levels number different classes antidiabetic medications available mouth metformin others available injection glp1 agonists type diabetes treated insulin typically combination regular insulin synthetic insulin analogscitation needed
metformin generally recommended first line treatment type diabetes good evidence decreases mortality4 works decreasing livers production glucose75 several groups drugs mostly given mouth also decrease blood sugar type include agents increase insulin release agents decrease absorption sugar intestines agents make body sensitive insulin75 insulin used type diabetes longacting formulation usually added initially continuing oral medications4 doses insulin increased effect476
since cardiovascular disease serious complication associated diabetes recommended blood pressure levels 13080 mmhg77 however evidence supports less equal somewhere 14090 mmhg 160100 mmhg additional benefit found blood pressure targets beneath range isolated decrease stroke risk accompanied increased risk serious adverse events7879 2016 review found potential harm treating lower mmhg80 among medications lower blood pressure angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aceis improve outcomes similar medications angiotensin receptor blockers arbs not81 aspirin also recommended people cardiovascular problems however routine aspirin found improve outcomes uncomplicated diabetes82
surgery
pancreas transplant occasionally considered people type diabetes severe complications disease including stage kidney disease requiring kidney transplantation83
weight loss surgery obesity type diabetes often effective measure84 many able maintain normal blood sugar levels little medications following surgery85 longterm mortality decreased86 however shortterm mortality risk less surgery87 body mass index cutoffs surgery appropriate clear86 recommended option considered unable weight blood sugar control88
