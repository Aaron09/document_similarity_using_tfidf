grants merit review processedit
seeks fulfill mission chiefly issuing competitive limitedterm grants response specific proposals research community also makes contracts proposals solicited funds kinds operate laboratories unlike federal research agencies notable examples nasa national institutes health
receives 50000 proposals year funds 10000 them6 funded typically projects ranked highest merit review process current version introduced 19977 reviews carried reviewers panels independent scientists engineers educators experts relevant fields study selected particular attention avoiding conflicts interest example reviewers cannot work institution employs proposing researchers proposal evaluations confidential proposing researchers names reviewers
first merit review criterion intellectual merit second broader societal impact proposed research latter opposition scientific policy communities since inception 19978 june 2010 national science board governing body science advisers legislative executive branches convened task force merit review determine well current merit review criteria used evaluate proposals serving agency9 task force reinforced support criteria appropriate goals aims agency published revised version merit review criteria 2012 report clarify improve function criteria however criteria already mandated merit review procedures 2010 reauthorization america competes act10 also includes emphasis promoting potentially transformative research phrase included recent incarnation merit review criteria11

budget performance historyedit

legislative historyedit
midst world policymakers became convinced something done americas scientific infrastructure although federal government established nearly scientific organizations 1910 1940 relied upon primarily laissezfaire approach scientific research development growing rubber shortages warrelated bottlenecks many rethink americas decentralized marketdriven approach science despite growing consensus something done consensus primary proposals emerged deal senator harley kilgore another vannevar bush44

harley kilgores vision

narratives national science foundation typically concentrated vannevar bush 1945 publication sciencethe endless frontier45 began change late 1970s scholars looked closer historical record46 discovering first appeared comprehensive deal policy proposed harley kilgore west virginia swept office wave deal politicians kilgore small businessman deep distrust monopolies looking landscape wartime research kilgore concerned largely laissezfaire approach producing technologies products also concerned lack coordination federal government private firms believing organizational chaos would lead failure technology production distressed concentration research activities hands elite universities private firms feared monopolistic industries incentives develop products needed postwar economic social welfare solution propose comprehensive centralized research body would responsible many stakeholders would charge producing basic applied research according vision research would longer driven invisible hand market research projects would selected public public would represented committee stakeholders including commuting members industry academia research results products would owned private interests instead public would rights patents funded public monies rather market pursue applied research proposed agency would pursue basic applied research would support science direct economic social importance responding worry concentration research monies would equitably spread across universities44

vannevar bushs approach

kilgores proposals mixed support nonelite universities well small businesses supported proposals budget bureau also supported opponents feared policy would take research hands scientists others suggested policy would socialize large independent section economy another opponent vannevar bush liaison congress office scientific research development recognized problems kilgore highlighted liked things kilgores proposals thought proposed federal science agency much different form bush like idea letting social interests community members drive science policy feared selection research projects would become politicized also complete faith ability scientists pick best possible projects furthermore contrast kilgore felt agency narrower mandate pursuing basic science rather basic applied science unlike kilgore believed public research results products instead responsible researchers research results broadly speaking bushs vision significantly narrow kilgores proposal maintained status patenting arrangements limited project selection scientists narrowed projects basic research44

reception passage technology mobilization 1950

kilgore first introduced policy 1942 title technology mobilization failing multiple attempts passed 1950 final bill mostly took character vannevar bushs proposal broadly speaking brought fragmented pluralistic system federal funding research eight years initial proposal final passage existing agencies claimed pieces original proposal leaving science foundation limited responsibilities final policy represented failure believed popular control research resources believe planning coordination could extended sphere science policy conversely final policy represented victory business interests feared competition government area applied research kilgores patent proposal threat property rights scientists gained control would later become important source resources professional autonomy44
