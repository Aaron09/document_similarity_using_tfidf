9564 international standard personal identification number management security financial services
used verify identity customer user bank card within electronic funds transfer system typically authorize transfer withdrawal funds therefore important protect pins unauthorized disclosure misuse modern banking systems require interoperability variety entry devices smart cards card readers card issuers acquiring banks retailers including transmission pins entities common rules handling securing pins required ensure technical compatibility mutually agreed level security 9564 provides principles techniques meet requirements
9564 comprises three partsnote general title financial services personal identification number management security
part basic principles requirements pins cardbased systemsedit
9564120111 specifies basic principles techniques secure management includes general principles specific requirements
basic principlesedit
basic principles management include

management functions shall implemented software hardware functionality cannot modified without detection data cannot obtained misused
encrypting different bank account shall predictably give cipher text
security encryption shall depend secrecy secrecy algorithm
must always stored encrypted physically secured
customer user card andor authorized card issuer staff shall involved selection issuing card issuer staff involved appropriate strictly enforced procedures shall used
stored encrypted shall protected substitution
shall revoked compromised suspected
card issuer shall responsible verification
customer shall advised importance keeping secret

entry devicesedit
standard specifies characteristics required recommended entry devices also known pads device customer enters including

entry devices shall allow entry digits zero nine numeric keys also letters printed e161 letters customers convenience internally entry device handles digits standard support multitap similar standard also recommends customers warned devices letters
entry device shall physically secured feasible modify operation extract pins encryption keys
entry device designed installed prevent people observing entered
keyboard layout standardized consistent unambiguous labels function keys enter clear entry cancel transaction standard also recommends specific colours function keys green enter yellow clear cancel

smart card readersedit
stored secure smart card verified offline card entry device reader used card verify integrated single physically secure unit need
additional requirements apply smart card readers include

card reader constructed prevent someone monitoring communications card inserting monitoring device card slot
entry device card reader part integrated secure unit shall encrypted transmitted entry device card reader

specific control requirementsedit
specific requirements include

hardware software used processing shall implemented

correct functioning assured
cannot modified accessed without detection
data cannot inappropriately accessed modified misused
cannot determined bruteforce search


shall communicated verbally particular bank personnel shall never customer disclose recommend value
encryption keys used purpose

lengthedit
standard specifies pins shall four twelve digits long noting longer pins secure harder also suggests issuer assign pins longer digits
selectionedit
three methods selecting generating

assigned derived
card issuer generates applying cryptographic function account number value associated customer


assigned random
card issuer generates value using random number generator


customer selected
customer selects value

issuance deliveryedit
standard includes requirements keeping secret transmitting generation issuer customer include

never available card issuing staff
displayed printed customer appropriately secure manner method mailer envelope designed printed without visible even printing time envelope opened mailer must also constructed prior opening obvious customer aware disclosed
shall never appear associated customers account example mailer must include account number sufficient information physical delivery name address associated card shall mailed together time

encryptionedit
protect transmission entry device verifier standard requires encrypted specifies several formats used case encoded block encrypted approved algorithm according part standard
block formats
format 0edit
block constructed xoring 64bit fields plain text field account number field comprise fourbit nibbles
plain text field

nibble value identifies format block
nibble encoding length
nibbles encoding digit
14−n nibbles holding fill value 11112

account number field

four nibbles value zero
nibbles containing rightmost digits primary account number excluding check digit

format 1edit
format used available block constructed concatenating transaction number thus

nibble value identifies format block
nibble encoding length
nibbles encoding digit
14−n nibbles encoding unique value transaction sequence number time stamp random number

format 2edit
format local offline systems smart cards block constructed concatenating filler value thus

nibble value identifies format block
nibble encoding length
nibbles encoding digit
14−n nibbles holding fill value 11112

except format value first nibble identical plain text field format
format 3edit
format format except fill digits random values first nibble identifies block format value
extended blocksedit
formats suitable triple data encryption algorithm correspond 64bit block size however standard allows encryption algorithms larger block sizes advanced encryption standard block size bits cases must encoding extended block format defined 2015 amendment 956412
part approved algorithms enciphermentedit
9564220143 specifies encryption algorithms used encrypting pins approved algorithms

triple data encryption algorithm
