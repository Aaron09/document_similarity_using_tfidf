bliss–leavitt mark torpedo


modern torpedo selfpropelled weapon explosive warhead launched water surface propelled underwater towards target designed detonate either contact target proximity
historically called automotive automobile locomotive fish torpedo colloquially called fish term torpedo originally employed variety devices would today called mines 1900 torpedo used strictly designate underwater selfpropelled weapon
battleship evolved primarily around engagements armoured ships largecaliber guns torpedo allowed torpedo boats lighter surface ships submersibles even ordinary fishing boats frogmen later aircraft destroy large armoured ships without need large guns though sometimes risk longerrange shellfire
todays torpedoes divided lightweight heavyweight classes straightrunning autonomous homers wireguided launched variety platforms
