three main ways natural languages categorize nouns genders according logical symbolic similarities meaning semantic grouping nouns similar form morphological apparently arbitrary convention lexical possibly rooted languages history languages grammatical gender combination three types criteria found although type prevalent
strict semantic criteriaedit
languages gender noun directly determined physical attributes animacy exceptions rule relatively languages dravidian languages system described
another example dizi language asymmetrical genders feminine includes living beings female woman girl diminutives masculine encompasses nouns broom language feminine nouns always marked in26
another african language defaka three genders male humans female humans third remaining nouns gender marked personal pronouns standard english pronouns similar respect although english gendered pronouns used domestic animals animal known sometimes certain objects ships27 happened titanic sank
mostly semantic criteriaedit
languages gender nouns mostly determined physical semantic attributes although remain nouns whose gender assigned corbett calls semantic residue28 world view mythology speakers influence division categories29
example zande language four genders male human female human animal inanimate30 however nouns representing inanimate entities nonetheless animate gender heavenly objects moon rainbow metal objects hammer ring edible plants sweet potato nonmetallic objects whistle ball many round shape explained role play mythology30
language three genders masculine feminine neuter gender assignment based semantics many inanimate nouns outside neuter class masculine nouns include male animates fish trees moon large wooden objects living beings religious items feminine nouns include female animates three types fish plants heavenly objects body parts skin diseases soul religious items words part whole well nouns fall aforementioned classes neuter gender assignment nonsexdifferentiable things complex general importance kets feminine whereas objects importance fish wood masculine mythology significant factor31
alamblak language genders masculine feminine however masculine also includes things tall long slender narrow fish snakes arrows slender trees whereas feminine gender things short squat wide turtles houses shields squat trees29
distinction gender noun gender object refers clear nouns different genders used object french vélo bicyclette
correlation gender form nounedit
many languages nouns assigned gender largely without semantic basis based feature animacy person thing noun represents however many languages correlation greater lesser degree gender form noun letter syllable ends
example portuguese spanish nouns consonant mostly masculine whereas mostly feminine regardless meaning nouns vowel assigned gender either according etymology analogy convention rules override semantics cases example noun membromiembro member always masculine even refers girl woman pessoapersona person always feminine even refers cases though meaning takes precedence noun comunista communist masculine refers could refer even though ends fact nouns spanish portuguese romance languages italian french generally follow gender latin words derived nouns deviate rules gender usually etymological explanation problema problem masculine spanish derived greek noun neuter gender whereas radio radio station feminine shortening estación radio phrase whose head feminine noun estación spanish nouns feminine derive latin feminines
suffixes often carry specific gender example german diminutives suffixes chen lein meaning little young always neuter even refer people mädchen girl fräulein young woman similarly suffix ling makes countable nouns uncountable nouns teig dough teigling piece dough personal nouns abstract nouns lehre teaching strafe punishment lehrling apprentice sträfling convict adjectives feige cowardly feigling coward always produces masculine nouns german suffixes heit keit comparable hood ness english produce feminine nouns
irish nouns ending óireoir always masculine whereas ending ógeog lann always feminine
arabic nouns whose singular form ends marbūṭa traditionally becoming pausa feminine gender significant exceptions word خليفة khalīfah caliph certain masculine personal names أسامة ʾusāmah however many masculine nouns take marbūṭa plural example أستاذ ustādh male professor plural أساتذة asātidha might confused feminine singular noun gender also predictable type derivation instance verbal nouns stem التفعيل altafʿīl فعّل، يفعّل faʿʿala yufaʿʿil always masculine
french nouns ending tend feminine whereas others tend masculine many exceptions cadre arbre signe meuble nuage masculine façon chanson voix main feminine certain suffixes quite reliable indicators added verb garer park garage nettoyer clean nettoyage cleaning indicates masculine noun however part root word feminine plage beach image hand nouns ending tion sion aison feminine
nouns sometimes vary form enable derivation differently gendered cognate nouns example produce nouns similar meaning referring someone different thus spanish niño means niña means girl paradigm exploited making words masculine nouns abogado lawyer diputado member parliament doctor doctor straightforward make feminine equivalents abogada diputada doctora
personal names frequently constructed affixes identify bearer common feminine suffixes used english names latin romance origin robert roberta french origin justin justine
although gender inflection used construct nouns names people opposite sexes languages grammatical gender alone constitute grammatical gender distinct words names women also common languages grammatical gender system nouns general english example feminine suffixes actress poetess also distinguishes male female personal names examples
gender personal namesedit




statistical data spanish nouns names ending


given names proper nouns follow gender grammatical rules common nouns indoeuropean languages female grammatical gender created using ending
classical latin typically made grammatical feminine gender silva forest aqua water reflected feminine names originating period like emilia romance languages preserved characteristic example spanish approximately feminine nouns ending given names ending32

apparent absence criteriaedit
languages gender markers eroded time possibly deflexion longer recognizable many german nouns example indicate gender either meaning form cases nouns gender must simply memorized gender regarded integral part noun considered entry speakers lexicon reflected dictionaries typically indicate gender noun headwords applicable
secondlanguage learners often encouraged memorize modifier usually definite article conjunction noun example learner french learn word chair chaise meaning chair carries information noun chaise feminine feminine singular form definite article
learning second language spanish speakers encouraged memorize articles either front word generally correspond masculine feminine however worth noting exceptions rule examples words considered exceptions would panda panda mano hand cura priest

relatively uncommon noun possible gender31213 happens associated difference referent nouns comunista spanish either masculine feminine depending whether refers male female difference meaning word example german word meaning lake masculine whereas identical word meaning feminine sense used disambiguate homonyms especially different meanings totally unrelated example norwegian noun ting masculine ting thing whereas neutral ting assembly parliament storting tings like borgarting regional courts another example bulgarian word пръст prəst means finger masculine soil feminine even rarer cases gender ambiguous bulgarian word пу̀стош pustosh wilderness either masculine definite form пу̀стоша pustoshə feminine definite form пустошта̀ pustoshta without change meaning preference usage
sometimes nouns gender change plural singular french words amour love délice delight orgue organ musical instrument masculine singular feminine plural anomalies historical explanation amour used feminine singular result slightly different notions orgue singular usually barrel organ whereas plural orgues usually refers collection columns church organdisputed discuss examples italian words uovo braccio masculine singular form irregular plurals uova braccia endings feminine singular feminine plural agreement related forms second declension latin neuter nouns derive ovum bracchium nominative plurals bracchia
norwegian many nouns could either feminine masculine according dialect level formality whim speakerwriter even written forms language many nouns whose gender optional choosing masculine gender often seem formal using feminine might creation norwegian nynorsk norwegian bokmål late 19th century norwegians wrote danish lost feminine gender thus making masculine gender corresponding exactly danish common gender conjugation norwegian bokmål oldfashioned formal sounding modern norwegians woman conjugated either gender damen masculine formal dama feminine feminine form normally used official documents bokmål spoken western oslo dialect used royal family bergen
noun another example might decline masculine solen soler solene feminine sola soler solene norwegian bokmål goes common words like book dukke doll bøtte bucket forth interestingly many words possible choose gender inanimate objects might suspect would conjugated neuter gender nouns conjugated neuter gender normally conjugated feminine masculine norwegian also slight tendency towards using masculine indefinite article even choosing feminine conjugation noun many eastern norwegian dialects instance girl jente jenta jenter jentene

borrowed word happens suffix borrowing language uses gender marker suffix tends dictate gender
borrowed word rhymes native words latter tend dictate gender
default assignment borrowing languages unmarked gender
