historyedit
since 1980s sequence information become increasingly abundant many laboratories realized started store information central repositories primary database9 however information provided primary sequence databases lower level database focus different aspect gather scattered data weizmann institute science crown human genome centre developed database called ‘genecards’ 1997 database mainly deals human genome information human genes encoded proteins’ functions related diseases1

genedecks novel analysis tool identify similar partner genes provides similarity metric highlighting shared descriptors genes based genecards’ unique wealth combinatorial annotations human genes

annotation combinatory using genedecks similar genes particular gene selected combinatorial annotation summary table result ranking different level similarity identified genes probe gene
annotation unification different data source often offer annotations heterogeneous naming system annotation unification genedecks based similarity genecards genecontent space detection algorithms
partner hunting genedecks’s partner hunter users give query gene system seeks similar genes based combinatorial similarity weighted attributes
distillation distiller users give genes system ranks attributes degree sharing within given gene like partner hunter enables sophisticated investigation variety gene sets diverse origins discovering elucidating relevant biological patterns thus enhancing systematic genomics systems biology scrutiny81011
