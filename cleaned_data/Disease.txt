terminologyedit
conceptsedit
many cases terms disease disorder morbidity sickness illness used interchangeably6 situations however specific terms considered preferable

disease
term disease broadly refers condition impairs normal functioning body reason diseases associated dysfunctioning bodys normal homeostatic processes7 term disease count sense disease diseases many diseases noncount sense much disease less disease disease commonly term used refer specifically infectious diseases clinically evident diseases result presence pathogenic microbial agents including viruses bacteria fungi protozoa multicellular organisms aberrant proteins known prions infection produce clinically evident impairment normal functioning presence normal bacteria yeasts passenger virus considered disease contrast infection asymptomatic incubation period expected produce symptoms later usually considered disease noninfectious diseases diseases including forms cancercitation needed heart disease genetic disease
acquired disease
disease began point ones lifetime opposed disease already present birth congenital disease acquired sounds like could mean caught contagion simply means acquired sometime birth also sounds like could imply secondary disease acquired disease primary disease
acute disease
disease shortterm nature acute term sometimes also connotes fulminant nature
chronic disease
disease longterm issue chronic
congenital disease
disease present birth often genetic inherited also result vertically transmitted infection mother hivaids
genetic disease
disease caused genetic mutation often inherited mutations random novo
hereditary inherited disease
type genetic disease caused mutation hereditary families
iatrogenic disease
disease condition caused medical intervention
idiopathic disease
disease whose cause unknown medical science advanced many diseases whose causes formerly complete mysteries somewhat explained example realized autoimmunity cause forms diabetes mellitus type even understand every molecular detail involved even extensively explained example realized gastric ulcers often associated helicobacter pylori infection
incurable disease
disease cannot cured
primary disease
disease came root cause illness opposed secondary disease sequela another disease
secondary disease
disease sequela complication disease underlying cause root cause bacterial infections either primary healthy bacteria arrived secondary viral infection burn predisposed creating open wound weakened immunity bacteria would gotten established otherwise
terminal disease
disease death inevitable result
illness
illness generally used synonym disease8 however term occasionally used refer specifically patients personal experience disease910 model possible person disease without objectively definable asymptomatic medical condition subclinical infection without diseased person perceives normal experience medical condition medicalizes nondisease situation life—for example person feels unwell result embarrassment interprets feelings sickness rather normal emotions symptoms illness often directly result infection collection evolved responses—sickness behavior body—that helps clear infection aspects illness include lethargy depression loss appetite sleepiness hyperalgesia inability concentrate111213
disorder
medicine disorder functional abnormality disturbance medical disorders categorized mental disorders physical disorders genetic disorders emotional behavioral disorders functional disorders term disorder often considered valueneutral less stigmatizing terms disease illness therefore preferred terminology circumstances14 mental health term mental disorder used acknowledging complex interaction biological social psychological factors psychiatric conditions however term disorder also used many areas medicine primarily identify physical disorders caused infectious organisms metabolic disorders
medical condition
medical condition broad term includes diseases lesions disorders nonpathologic condition normally receives medical treatment pregnancy childbirth term medical condition generally includes mental illnesses contexts term used specifically denote illness injury disease except mental illnesses diagnostic statistical manual mental disorders widely used psychiatric manual defines mental disorders uses term general medical condition refer diseases illnesses injuries except mental disorders15 usage also commonly seen psychiatric literature health insurance policies also define medical condition illness injury disease except psychiatric illnesses16
valueneutral terms like disease term medical condition sometimes preferred people health issues consider deleterious hand emphasizing medical nature condition term sometimes rejected proponents autism rights movement
term medical condition also synonym medical state case describes individual patients current state medical standpoint usage appears statements describe patient critical condition example
morbidity
morbidity latin morbidus meaning sick unhealthy diseased state disability poor health cause17 term used refer existence form disease degree health condition affects patient among severely patients level morbidity often measured scoring systems comorbidity simultaneous presence medical conditions schizophrenia substance abuse
epidemiology actuarial science term morbidity rate refer either incidence rate prevalence disease medical condition measure sickness contrasted mortality rate condition proportion people dying given time interval morbidity rates used actuarial professions health insurance life insurance longterm care insurance determine correct premiums charge customers morbidity rates help insurers predict likelihood insured contract develop number specified diseases
pathosis pathology
pathosis plural pathoses synonymous disease word pathology also sense commonly used physicians medical literature although editors prefer reserve pathology senses sometimes slight connotative shade causes preference pathology pathosis implying poorly analyzed pathophysiologic process rather disease implying specific disease entity defined diagnostic criteria already hard quantify denotatively explains cognitive synonymy invariable
syndrome
syndrome association several medical signs symptoms characteristics often occur together syndromes syndrome cause names syndrome disease synonymous example charcot–marie–tooth syndrome also called charcot–marie–tooth disease others parkinsonian syndrome multiple possible causes example acute coronary syndrome disease rather manifestation several diseases myocardial infarction secondary coronary artery disease syndromes cause unknown familiar syndrome name often remains even underlying cause found number different possible primary causes
predisease
predisease subclinical prodromal vanguard disease state prediabetes prehypertension common examples nosology epistemology predisease contentious though seldom bright line differentiating legitimate concern subclinicalprodromalpremonitory status hand conflict interest–driven disease mongering medicalization hand identifying legitimate predisease result useful preventive measures motivating person healthy amount physical exercise18 labeling healthy person unfounded notion predisease result overtreatment taking drugs help people severe disease paying drug prescription instances whose benefit–cost ratio minuscule placing waste category waste fraud abuse classification

types body systemedit

mental
mental illness broad generic label category illnesses include affective emotional instability behavioral dysregulation cognitive dysfunction impairment specific illnesses known mental illnesses include major depression generalized anxiety disorders schizophrenia attention deficit hyperactivity disorder name mental illness biological anatomical chemical genetic psychological trauma conflict origin impair affected persons ability work study harm interpersonal relationships term insanity used technically legal term
organic
organic disease caused physical physiological change tissue organ body term sometimes excludes infections commonly used contrast mental disorders includes emotional behavioral disorders changes physical structures functioning body stroke traumatic brain injury psychosocial issues

stagesedit
flareup redirects transformers character flareup transformers
infectious disease incubation period time infection appearance symptoms latency period time infection ability disease spread another person precede follow simultaneous appearance symptoms viruses also exhibit dormant phase called viral latency virus hides body inactive state example varicella zoster virus causes chickenpox acute phase recovery chickenpox virus remain dormant nerve cells many years later cause herpes zoster shingles

acute disease
acute disease shortlived disease like common cold
chronic disease
chronic disease lasts long time usually least months time constantly present remission periodically relapse chronic disease stable worse progressive gets worse time chronic diseases permanently cured chronic diseases beneficially treated even cannot permanently cured
clinical disease
clinical consequences words stage disease produces characteristic signs symptoms disease19 aids clinical disease stage infection
cure
cure medical condition treatment likely remission refers disappearance possibly temporarily symptoms complete remission best possible outcome incurable diseases
flareup
flareup refer either recurrence symptoms onset severe symptoms
progressive disease
progressive disease disease whose typical natural course worsening disease death serious debility organ failure occurs slowly progressive diseases also chronic diseases many also degenerative diseases opposite progressive disease stable disease static disease medical condition exists better worse
refractory disease
refractory disease disease resists treatment especially individual case resists treatment normal specific disease question
subclinical disease
also called silent disease silent stage asymptomatic disease stage diseases symptoms first noted20
terminal phase
person soon disease regardless whether disease typically causes death stage earlier disease process active dying terminal phase

extentedit

localized disease
localized disease affects part body athletes foot infection
disseminated disease
disseminated disease spread parts cancer usually called metastatic disease
systemic disease
systemic disease disease affects entire body influenza high blood pressure

classificationsedit
main article nosology
diseases classified cause pathogenesis mechanism disease caused symptoms alternatively diseases classified according organ system involved though often complicated since many diseases affect organ
chief difficulty nosology diseases often cannot defined classified clearly especially cause pathogenesis unknown thus diagnostic terms often reflect symptom symptoms syndrome
classical classification human disease derives observational correlation pathological analysis clinical syndromes today preferred classify cause known21
known used classification diseases world health organizations periodically updated currently last publication icd10
causesedit
also transmission medicine
diseases influenza contagious commonly believed infectious microorganisms cause diseases known pathogens include varieties bacteria viruses protozoa fungi infectious diseases transmitted handtomouth contact infectious material surfaces bites insects carriers disease contaminated water food often fecal contamination etc22 addition sexually transmitted diseases cases microorganisms readily spread person person play role diseases prevented ameliorated appropriate nutrition lifestyle changes
diseases forms cancer heart disease mental disorders noninfectious diseases many noninfectious diseases partly completely genetic basis genetic disorder thus transmitted generation another
social determinants health social conditions people live determine health illnesses generally related social economic political environmental circumstances social determinants health recognized several health organizations public health agency canada world health organization greatly influence collective personal wellbeing world health organizations social determinants council also recognizes social determinants health poverty
cause disease poorly understood societies tend mythologize disease metaphor symbol whatever culture considers evil example bacterial cause tuberculosis discovered 1882 experts variously ascribed disease heredity sedentary lifestyle depressed mood overindulgence rich food alcohol—all social ills time23
types causesedit

airborne
airborne disease disease caused pathogens transmitted
foodborne
foodborne illness food poisoning illness resulting consumption food contaminated pathogenic bacteria toxins viruses prions parasites
infectious
infectious diseases also known transmissible diseases communicable diseases comprise clinically evident illness characteristic medical signs symptoms disease resulting infection presence growth pathogenic biological agents individual host organism included category contagious diseases infection influenza common cold commonly spreads person another communicable diseases disease spread person another necessarily spread everyday contact
lifestyle
lifestyle disease disease appears increase frequency countries become industrialized people live longer especially risk factors include behavioral choices like sedentary lifestyle diet high unhealthful foods refined carbohydrates trans fats alcoholic beverages
noncommunicable
noncommunicable disease medical condition disease nontransmissible noncommunicable diseases cannot spread directly person another heart disease cancer examples noncommunicable diseases humans

preventionedit
main article preventive medicine
many diseases disorders prevented variety means include sanitation proper nutrition adequate exercise vaccinations selfcare public health measures
treatmentsedit
main article therapy
medical therapies treatments efforts cure improve disease health problem medical field therapy synonymous word treatment among psychologists term refer specifically psychotherapy talk therapy common treatments include medications surgery medical devices selfcare treatments provided organized health care system informally patient family members
preventive healthcare avoid injury sickness disease first place treatment cure applied medical problem already started treatment attempts improve remove problem treatments produce permanent cures especially chronic diseases cures subset treatments reverse diseases completely medical problems permanently many diseases cannot completely cured still treatable pain management also called pain medicine branch medicine employing interdisciplinary approach relief pain improvement quality life living pain24
treatment medical emergencies must provided promptly often emergency department less critical situations urgent care facility
epidemiologyedit
main article epidemiology
epidemiology study factors cause encourage diseases diseases common certain geographic areas among people certain genetic socioeconomic characteristics different times year
epidemiology considered cornerstone methodology public health research highly regarded evidencebased medicine identifying risk factors disease study communicable noncommunicable diseases work epidemiologists ranges outbreak investigation study design data collection analysis including development statistical models test hypotheses documentation results submission peerreviewed journals epidemiologists also study interaction diseases population condition known syndemic epidemiologists rely number scientific disciplines biology better understand disease processes biostatistics current information available geographic information science store data disease patterns social science disciplines better understand proximate distal risk factors epidemiology help identify causes well guide prevention efforts
studying diseases epidemiology faces challenge defining especially poorly understood diseases different groups might significantly different definitions without agreedon definition different researchers report different numbers cases characteristics disease25
morbidity databases compiled data supplied states territories health authorities national levels2627 larger scale european hospital morbidity database hmdb28 contain hospital discharge data detailed diagnosis european hmdb datea submitted european countries world health organization regional office europe
burdens diseaseedit
disease burden impact health problem area measured financial cost mortality morbidity indicators
several measures used quantify burden imposed diseases people years potential life lost ypll simple estimate number years persons life shortened disease example person dies disease would probably lived without disease disease caused loss years potential life ypll measurements account disabled person dying measurement treats person dies suddenly person died decades illness equivalent 2004 world health organization calculated million years potential life lost premature death29
qualityadjusted life year qaly disabilityadjusted life year daly metrics similar take account whether person healthy diagnosis addition number years lost premature death measurements part years lost sick unlike ypll measurements show burden imposed people sick live normal lifespan disease high morbidity mortality high daly ypll 2004 world health organization calculated billion disabilityadjusted life years lost disease injury29 developed world heart disease stroke cause loss life neuropsychiatric conditions like major depressive disorder cause years lost sick

society cultureedit




obesity status symbol renaissance culture tuscan general alessandro borro attributed andrea sacchi 164530 generally regarded disease


society responds diseases subject medical sociology
condition considered disease cultures eras others example obesity represent wealth abundance status symbol famineprone areas places hardhit hivaids31 epilepsy considered sign spiritual gifts among hmong people32
sickness confers social legitimization certain benefits illness benefits work avoidance looked others person sick takes social role called sick role person responds dreaded disease cancer culturally acceptable fashion publicly privately honored higher social status33 return benefits sick person obligated seek treatment work become well comparison consider pregnancy interpreted disease sickness even mother baby benefit medical care
religions grant exceptions religious duties people sick example whose life would endangered fasting kippur ramadan exempted requirement even forbidden participating people sick also exempted social duties example health socially acceptable reason american refuse invitation white house34
identification condition disease rather simply variation human structure function significant social economic implications controversial recognitions diseases repetitive stress injury posttraumatic stress disorder also known soldiers heart shell shock combat fatigue number positive negative effects financial responsibilities governments corporations institutions towards individuals well individuals social implication viewing aging disease could profound though classification widespread
lepers people historically shunned infectious disease term leper still evokes social stigma fear disease still widespread social phenomenon though diseases evoke extreme social stigma
social standing economic status affect health diseases poverty diseases associated poverty social status diseases affluence diseases associated high social economic status diseases associated states varies according time place technology diseases diabetes mellitus associated poverty poor food choices affluence long lifespans sedentary lifestyles different mechanisms term lifestyle diseases describes diseases associated longevity common among older people example cancer common societies members live reach societies members reach
language diseaseedit
illness narrative organizing medical experience coherent story illustrates sick individuals personal experience
people metaphors make sense experiences disease metaphors move disease objective thing exists affective experience popular metaphors draw military concepts disease enemy must feared fought battled routed patient healthcare provider warrior rather passive victim bystander agents communicable diseases invaders noncommunicable diseases constitute internal insurrection civil threat urgent perhaps matter life death unthinkably radical even oppressive measures societys patients moral duty courageously mobilize struggle destruction cancer example metaphorical language35 language empowering patients leaves others feeling like failures36
another class metaphors describes experience illness journey person travels place disease changes discovers information increases experience along travel road recovery make changes right track choose pathways3536 explicitly immigrationthemed patient exiled home territory health land changing identity relationships process37 language common among british healthcare professionals language physical aggression36
metaphors diseasespecific slavery common metaphor addictions alcoholic enslaved drink smoker captive nicotine cancer patients treat loss hair chemotherapy metonymy metaphor losses caused disease35
diseases used metaphors social ills cancer common description anything endemic destructive society poverty injustice racism aids seen divine judgment moral decadence purging pollution invader could society become healthy again35 recently aids seemed less threatening type emotive language applied avian type diabetes mellitus38 authors 19th century commonly used tuberculosis symbol metaphor transcendence victims disease portrayed literature risen daily life become ephemeral objects spiritual artistic achievement 20th century cause better understood disease became emblem poverty squalor social problems37
