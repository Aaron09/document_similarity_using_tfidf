reverse faults particularly along convergent plate boundaries associated powerful earthquakes megathrust earthquakes including almost magnitude strikeslip faults particularly continental transforms produce major earthquakes magnitude earthquakes associated normal faults generally less magnitude every unit increase magnitude roughly thirtyfold increase energy released instance earthquake magnitude releases approximately times energy magnitude earthquake magnitude earthquake releases times energy magnitude earthquake magnitude earthquake releases amount energy 10000 atomic bombs like used world
energy released earthquake thus magnitude proportional area fault ruptures4 stress drop therefore longer length wider width faulted area larger resulting magnitude topmost brittle part earths crust cool slabs tectonic plates descending mantle parts planet store elastic energy release fault ruptures rocks hotter degrees celsius flow response stress rupture earthquakes56 maximum observed lengths ruptures mapped faults break single rupture approximately 1000 examples earthquakes chile 1960 alaska 1957 sumatra 2004 subduction zones longest earthquake ruptures strikeslip faults like andreas fault 1857 1906 north anatolian fault turkey 1939 denali fault alaska 2002 half third long lengths along subducting plate margins along normal faults even shorter

important parameter controlling maximum earthquake magnitude fault however maximum available length available width latter varies factor along converging plate margins angle rupture plane shallow typically degrees7 thus width plane within brittle crust earth become japan 2011 alaska 1964 making powerful earthquakes possible
strikeslip faults tend oriented near vertically resulting approximate width within brittle crust8 thus earthquakes magnitudes much larger possible maximum magnitudes along many normal faults even limited many located along spreading centers iceland thickness brittle layer km910
addition exists hierarchy stress level three fault types thrust faults generated highest strike slip intermediate normal faults lowest stress levels11 easily understood considering direction greatest principal stress direction force pushes rock mass faulting case normal faults rock mass pushed vertical direction thus pushing force greatest principal stress equals weight rock mass case thrusting rock mass escapes direction least principal stress namely upward lifting rock mass thus overburden equals least principal stress strikeslip faulting intermediate types described difference stress regime three faulting environments contribute differences stress drop faulting contributes differences radiated energy regardless fault dimensions
