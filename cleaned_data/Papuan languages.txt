although relatively little study languages compared austronesian family three preliminary attempts largescale genealogical classification joseph greenberg stephen wurm malcolm ross largest family posited papuan region trans–new guinea phylum consisting majority papuan languages running mainly along highlands guinea various highlevel families represent distinct migrations guinea presumably west2 since perhaps quarter papuan languages studied detail linguists understanding relationships continue revised
statistical analyses designed pick signals faint detected comparative method though disputed validity suggest five major papuan stocks roughly trans–new guinea west north east south papuan languages3 longrange comparison also suggested connections selected languages methodology orthodox historical linguistics4
great andamanese languages related western papuan languages covered term papuan2
greenbergs classificationedit
joseph greenberg proposed indopacific phylum containing northern andamanese languages papuan languages tasmanian languages australian aboriginal languages linguists accept grouping distinct trans–new guinea phylum classifications
wurms classificationedit
widely used classification papuan languages wurm listed approximate number languages family parentheses scheme used ethnologue prior rosss classification based preliminary work much typological wurm stated doesnt expect hold well scrutiny linguists including william foley suggested many wurms phyla based areal features structural similarities accept lowest levels classification inherited prior taxonomies foley 1986 divides papuan languages sixty small language families plus number isolates however recently foley accepted broad outline details wurms classification ross substantiated large portion wurms trans–new guinea phylum
according ross main problem wurms classification take contactinduced change account example several main branches trans–new guinea phylum vocabulary common trans–new guinea languages classified trans–new guinea similar grammatically however also many austronesian languages grammatically similar trans–new guinea languages influence contact bilingualism similarly several groups substantial basic vocabulary common trans–new guinea languages excluded phylum resemble grammatically
wurm believed papuan languages arrived several waves migration earlier languages perhaps including sepik–ramu languages related australian languages56 later migration bringing west papuan torricelli east papuan languages5 third wave bringing recent preaustronesian migration trans–new guinea family5

rosss classificationedit
malcolm ross reevaluated wurms proposal purely lexical grounds looked shared vocabulary especially shared idiosyncrasies analogous english german mich poor state documentation papuan languages restricts approach largely pronouns nonetheless ross believes able validate much wurms classification albeit revisions correct wurms partially typological approach trans–new guinea languages ethnologue 2009 largely follows ross
suggested families appear comparing pronouns pronoun borrowing rather genealogical relatedness however ross argues papuan languages closedclass pronoun systems resistant borrowing case massive number languages similar pronouns family like trans–new guinea preclude borrowing explanation also shows cases alleged pronoun borrowing guinea simple coincidence explainable regular developments protolanguages families question earlier forms languages reconstructed pronouns become less similar ross argues openclass pronoun systems borrowings common found hierarchical cultures southeast asia japan pronouns indicate details relationship social status rather simply grammatical proforms egalitarian guinea societies
ross proposed papuan language families 9–13 isolates however stringent criteria able find enough data classify papuan languages especially many isolates close relatives classification
ross also found lower mamberamo languages least warembori language—he insufficient data pauwi austronesian languages heavily transformed contact papuan languages much takia language reef islands santa cruz languages wurms east papuan phylum potential 24th family subsequent work shown highly divergent austronesian languages well
note classification reliable past attempts based single parameter pronouns therefore must remain tentative although pronouns conservative elements language short utilise reduced languages phonemic inventory phenomena greatly increase possibility chance resemblances especially confirmed lexical similarities
