today south koreans call korean alphabet hangeul name coined korean linguist sigyeong 1912 name combines archaic korean word meaning great geul meaning script word used refer korea general name could also interpreted mean korean script11 romanized following ways

hangeul hangeul revised romanization korean south korean government uses english publications encourages purposes
hangŭl mccune–reischauer system used english word often rendered without diacritics hangul often capitalized hangul appears many english dictionaries
hankul yale romanization system recommended technical linguistic studies

north koreans call korean alphabet chosŏngŭl chosŏn north korean name korea12
namesedit
early 20th century korean elite preferred write using chinese characters hanja referred hanja jinseo true letters meanwhile accounts referred hangul derisively amkeul meaning womens script ahaetgeul meaning childrens script though written evidence this13
supporters hangul referred jeongeum meaning correct pronunciation gungmun meaning national script eonmun meaning vernacular script13
historyedit
also origin hangul
creationedit
creation hangul people korea primarily wrote using classical chinese alongside native phonetic writing systems predate hangul hundreds years including hyangchal gugyeol gakpil14151617 however fundamental differences korean chinese languages large number characters needed learned many lower class koreans illiterate18 order promote literacy among common people sejong great fourth king joseon dynasty personally created promulgated alphabet1819

reforms japanese ruleedit
japanese occupation korea began 1910 japanese became official language korea however hangul still taught koreanestablished schools built annexation korean written mixed hanjahangul script lexical roots written hanja grammatical forms hangul japan banned earlier korean literature public schooling became mandatory children
hangul orthography partially standardized 1912 vowel arae ㆍ–which longer used modern hangul–was restricted sinokorean roots emphatic consonants standardized final consonants restricted long vowels marked diacritic left syllable dropped 192121
second colonial reform occurred 1930 vowel arae abolished emphatic consonants changed final consonants allowed making orthography morphophonemic written alone without vowel occurred nouns nominative particle introduced vowels replacing
sigyeong linguist coined term hangul great script replace eonmun vulgar script 1912 established korean language research society later renamed hangul society reformed orthography standardized system hangul 1933 principal change make hangul morphophonemic practical given existing letters21 system transliterating foreign orthographies published 1940
