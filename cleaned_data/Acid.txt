svante arrhenius


swedish chemist svante arrhenius attributed properties acidity hydrogen ions protons 1884 arrhenius acid substance added water increases concentration ions water45 note chemists often write refer hydrogen describing acidbase reactions free hydrogen nucleus proton exist alone water exists hydronium thus arrhenius acid also described substance increases concentration hydronium ions added water examples include molecular substances acetic acid
arrhenius base hand substance increases concentration hydroxide ions dissolved water decreases concentration hydronium ions react form molecules


h2ol h2ol

acidic solution concentration hydronium ions greater 10−7 moles liter since defined negative logarithm concentration hydronium ions acidic solutions thus less
