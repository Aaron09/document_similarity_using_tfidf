oral actinodiscus polyp closeup mouth


adult cnidarians appear either swimming medusae sessile polyps many hydrozoan species known alternate forms radially symmetrical like wheel tube respectively since animals heads ends described oral nearest mouth aboral furthest mouth fringes tentacles equipped cnidocytes around edges medusae generally inner ring tentacles around mouth hydroids consist colonies zooids serve different purposes defense reproduction catching prey mesoglea polyps usually thin often soft medusae usually thick springy returns original shape muscles around edge contracted squeeze water enabling medusae swim sort propulsion10
skeletonsedit
medusae supporting structure mesoglea hydra anemones close mouths feeding water digestive cavity acts hydrostatic skeleton rather like waterfilled balloon polyps tubularia columns waterfilled cells support pens stiffen mesoglea calcium carbonate spicules tough fibrous proteins rather like sponges10
colonial polyps chitinous periderm gives support protection connecting sections lower parts individual polyps stony corals secrete massive calcium carbonate exoskeletons polyps collect materials sand grains shell fragments attach outsides colonial anemones stiffen mesoglea sediment particles10
main cell layersedit
cnidaria diploblastic animals words main cell layers complex animals triploblasts three main layers main cell layers cnidarians form epithelia mostly cell thick attached fibrous basement membrane secrete also secrete jellylike mesoglea separates layers layer faces outwards known ectoderm outside skin generally contains following types cells9

epitheliomuscular cells whose bodies form part epithelium whose bases extend form muscle fibers parallel rows16 fibers outwardfacing cell layer generally right angles fibers inwardfacing anthozoa anemones corals scyphozoa jellyfish mesoglea also contains muscle cells10
cnidocytes harpoonlike nettle cells give phylum cnidaria name appear sometimes muscle cells9
nerve cells sensory cells appear sometimes muscle cells9 communicate synapses gaps across chemical signals flow motor nerve cells mostly bases muscle cells10
interstitial cells unspecialized replace lost damaged cells transforming appropriate types found bases muscle cells9

addition epitheliomuscular nerve interstitial cells inwardfacing gastroderm stomach skin contains gland cells secrete digestive enzymes species also contains concentrations cnidocytes used subdue prey still struggling910
mesoglea contains small numbers amoebalike cells10 muscle cells species9 however number middlelayer cells types much lower sponges10
polymorphismedit
polymorphism refers occurrence structurally functionally different types individuals within organism characteristic feature cnidarians particularly polyp medusa forms zooids within colonial organisms like hydrozoa17 hydrozoans colonial individuals arising individuals zooids take separate tasks18 example obelia feeding individuals gastrozooids individuals capable asexual reproduction gonozooids blastostyles freeliving sexually reproducing individuals medusae

nematocysts inject venom prey usually barbs keep embedded victims species nematocysts9
spirocysts penetrate victim inject venom entangle means small sticky hairs thread
ptychocysts used prey capture instead threads discharged ptychocysts used building protective tubes owners live ptychocysts found order ceriantharia tube anemones10

main components cnidocyte are910




hydras nematocyst firing
trigger cilium10



cilium fine hair projects surface acts trigger spirocysts cilia
tough capsule cnida houses thread payload mixture chemicals include venom adhesives cnida derived greek word κνίδη means nettle19
tubelike extension wall cnida points cnida like finger rubber glove pushed inwards cnidocyte fires finger pops cell venomous nematocyte fingers reveals barbs anchor prey
thread extension finger coils round cnidocyte fires thread usually hollow delivers chemicals cnida target
operculum cnida single hinged flap three flaps arranged like slices
cell body produces parts

difficult study firing mechanisms cnidocytes structures small complex least four hypotheses proposed9

rapid contraction fibers round cnida increase internal pressure
thread like coiled spring extends rapidly released
case chironex wasp chemical changes cnidas contents cause expand rapidly polymerization
chemical changes liquid cnida make much concentrated solution osmotic pressure forces water rapidly dilute mechanism observed nematocysts class hydrozoa sometimes producing pressures high atmospheres similar scuba tanks fully extending thread little milliseconds 0002 second10

cnidocytes fire hydras nematocysts lost tentacles capturing brine shrimp used cnidocytes replaced takes hours minimise wasteful firing types stimulus generally required trigger cnidocytes nearby sensory cells detect chemicals water cilia respond contact combination prevents firing distant nonliving objects groups cnidocytes usually connected nerves fires rest group requires weaker minimum stimulus cells fire first910
locomotionedit


play media


swimming nettle known purplestriped jelly chrysaora colorata


medusae swim form propulsion muscles especially inside bell squeeze water cavity inside bell springiness mesoglea powers recovery stroke since tissue layers thin provide little power swim currents enough control movement within currents10
hydras anemones move slowly rocks stream beds various means creeping like snails crawling like inchworms somersaulting swim clumsily waggling bases10
nervous system sensesedit
cnidarians generally thought brains even central nervous systems however integrative areas neural tissue could considered form centralization bodies innervated decentralized nerve nets control swimming musculature connect sensory structures though clade slightly different structures20 sensory structures usually called rhopalia generate signals response various types stimuli light pressure much medusa usually several around margin bell work together control motor nerve directly innervates swimming muscles cnidarians also parallel system scyphozoans takes form diffuse nerve modulatory effects nervous system21 well forming signal cables sensory neurons motoneurons intermediate neurons nerve also form ganglia local coordination centers communication nerve cells occur chemical synapses junctions hydrozoans though junctions present groups cnidarians many neurotransmitters many animals including chemicals glutamate gaba acetylcholine22
structure ensures musculature excited rapidly simultaneously directly stimulated point body also better able recover injury2021
medusae complex swimming colonies siphonophores chondrophores sense tilt acceleration means statocysts chambers lined hairs detect movements internal mineral grains called statoliths body tilts wrong direction animal rights increasing strength swimming movements side species ocelli simple eyes detect sources light however agile jellyfish unique among medusae possess four kinds true eyes retinas corneas lenses23 although eyes probably form images cubozoa clearly distinguish direction light coming well negotiate around solidcolored objects923
feeding excretionedit
cnidarians feed several ways predation absorbing dissolved organic chemicals filtering food particles water obtaining nutrients symbiotic algae within cells parasitism obtain majority food predation including corals hetroxenia leptogorgia depend almost completely endosymbionts absorbing dissolved nutrients9 cnidaria give symbiotic algae carbon dioxide nutrients place protection predators10
predatory species cnidocytes poison entangle prey venomous nematocysts start digestion injecting digestive enzymes smell fluids wounded prey makes tentacles fold inwards wipe prey mouth medusae tentacles round edge bell often short prey capture done oral arms extensions edge mouth often frilled sometimes branched increase surface area medusae often trap prey suspended food particles swimming upwards spreading tentacles oral arms sinking species suspended food particles important tentacles oral arms often rows cilia whose beating creates currents flow towards mouth produce nets mucus trap particles9 digestion intra extracellular
food digestive cavity gland cells gastroderm release enzymes reduce prey slurry usually within hours circulates digestive cavity colonial cnidarians connecting tunnels gastroderm cells absorb nutrients absorption take hours digestion within cells take days circulation nutrients driven water currents produced cilia gastroderm muscular movements nutrients reach parts digestive cavity10 nutrients reach outer cell layer diffusion animals zooids medusae thick mesogleas transported mobile cells mesoglea9
indigestible remains prey expelled mouth main waste product cells internal processes ammonia removed external internal water currents10
respirationedit
respiratory organs cell layers absorb oxygen expel carbon dioxide surrounding water water digestive cavity becomes stale must replaced nutrients absorbed expelled anthozoa ciliated grooves tentacles allowing pump water digestive cavity without opening mouth improves respiration feeding allows animals cavity hydrostatic skeleton control water pressure cavity without expelling undigested food9
cnidaria carry photosynthetic symbionts opposite problem excess oxygen prove toxic animals produce large quantities antioxidants neutralize excess oxygen9
regenerationedit
cnidarians regenerate allowing recover injury reproduce asexually medusae limited ability regenerate polyps small pieces even collections separated cells enables corals recover even apparently destroyed predators9
reproductionedit
























life cycle jellyfish910
larva searches site
polyp grows
9–11 polyp strobilates
12–14 medusa grows


sexualedit
cnidarian sexual reproduction often involves complex life cycle polyp medusa stages example scyphozoa jellyfish cubozoa jellies larva swims finds good site becomes polyp grows normally absorbs tentacles splits horizontally series disks become juvenile medusae process called strobilation juveniles swim slowly grow maturity polyp regrows continue strobilating periodically adults gonads gastroderm release sperm water breeding season910
phenomenon succession differently organized generations asexually reproducing sessile polyp followed freeswimming medusa sessile polyp reproduces sexually24 sometimes called alternation asexual sexual phases metagenesis confused alternation generations found plants
shortened forms life cycle common example oceanic scyphozoans omit polyp stage completely cubozoan polyps produce medusa hydrozoa variety life cycles polyp stages hydra medusae species medusae remain attached polyp responsible sexual reproduction extreme cases reproductive zooids look much like medusae meanwhile life cycle reversal polyps formed directly medusae without involvement sexual reproduction process observed hydrozoa turritopsis dohrnii25 laodicea undulata26 scyphozoa aurelia sp127 anthozoa medusa stage polyps responsible sexual reproduction9
spawning generally driven environmental factors changes water temperature release triggered lighting conditions sunrise sunset phase moon many species cnidaria spawn simultaneously location many sperm predators tiny percentage famous example great barrier reef least corals noncnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes turn water cloudy mass spawnings produce hybrids settle form polyps known long survive species release chemicals attract sperm species9
fertilized eggs develop larvae dividing enough cells form hollow sphere blastula depression forms gastrulation eventually becomes digestive cavity however cnidarians depression forms yolk animal pole bilaterians forms vegetal pole10 larvae called planulae swim crawl means cilia9 cigarshaped slightly broader front aboral vegetalpole eventually attaches substrate species polyp stage10
anthozoan larvae either large yolks capable feeding plankton already endosymbiotic algae help feed since parents immobile feeding capabilities extend larvaes range avoid overcrowding sites scyphozoan hydrozoan larvae little yolk lack endosymbiotic algae therefore settle quickly metamorphose polyps instead species rely medusae extend ranges10
asexualedit
known cnidaria reproduce asexually various means addition regenerating fragmented hydrozoan polyps medusae hydrozoans divide middle scyphozoan polyps split middle addition methods anthozoa split horizontally base asexual reproduction makes daughter cnidarian clone adult910
classificationedit
cnidarians long time grouped ctenophores phylum coelenterata increasing awareness differences caused placed separate phyla modern cnidarians generally classified four main classes9 sessile anthozoa anemones corals pens swimming scyphozoa jellyfish cubozoa jellies hydrozoa diverse group includes freshwater cnidarians well many marine forms sessile members hydra colonial swimmers portuguese staurozoa recently recognised class right rather subgroup scyphozoa parasitic myxozoa polypodiozoa recognized highly derived cnidarians rather closely related bilaterians6
