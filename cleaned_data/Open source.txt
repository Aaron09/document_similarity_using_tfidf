main article opensource economics
economists agree opensource information good20 knowledge good original work involving significant amount time money effort cost reproducing work enough additional users added zero near zero cost referred marginal cost product copyright creates monopoly price charged consumers significantly higher marginal cost production allows author recoup cost making original work copyright thus creates access costs consumers value work marginal cost less initial production cost access costs also pose problems authors wish create derivative work—such copy software program modified feature remix song—but unable unwilling copyright holder right
organized effectively consumers cooperative open source eliminates access costs consumers creators derivative works reducing restrictions copyright basic economic theory predicts lower costs would lead higher consumption also frequent creation derivative works organizations creative commons host websites individuals file alternative licenses levels restriction works21 selfmade protections free general society costs policing copyright infringement
others argue since consumers copies creators unable recoup initial cost production thus little economic incentive create first place argument consumers would lose goods would otherwise purchase would available practice content producers choose whether adopt proprietary license charge copies open license goods require large amounts professional research development pharmaceutical industry depends largely patents copyright intellectual property protection almost exclusively proprietary although increasingly sophisticated technologies developed opensource principles22
