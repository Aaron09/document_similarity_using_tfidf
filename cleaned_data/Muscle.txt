body contains three types muscle tissue skeletal muscle smooth muscle cardiac muscle magnification


muscle tissue soft tissue four fundamental types tissue present animals three types muscle tissue recognized vertebrates

skeletal muscle voluntary muscle anchored tendons aponeuroses places bone used effect skeletal movement locomotion maintaining posture though postural control generally maintained unconscious reflex muscles responsible react conscious control like nonpostural muscles average adult male made skeletal muscle average adult female made percentage body mass5
smooth muscle involuntary muscle found within walls organs structures esophagus stomach intestines bronchi uterus urethra bladder blood vessels arrector pili skin controls erection body hair unlike skeletal muscle smooth muscle conscious control
cardiac muscle myocardium also involuntary muscle akin structure skeletal muscle found heart

cardiac skeletal muscles striated contain sarcomeres packed highly regular arrangements bundles myofibrils smooth muscle cells arranged sarcomeres striated sarcomeres skeletal muscles arranged regular parallel bundles cardiac muscle sarcomeres connect branching irregular angles called intercalated discs striated muscle contracts relaxes short intense bursts whereas smooth muscle sustains longer even nearpermanent contractions
skeletal voluntary muscle divided broad types slow twitch fast twitch

type slow twitch muscle dense capillaries rich mitochondria myoglobin giving muscle tissue characteristic color carry oxygen sustain aerobic activity using fats carbohydrates fuel6 slow twitch fibers contract long periods time little force
type fast twitch muscle three major subtypes vary contractile speed7 force generated6 fast twitch fibers contract quickly powerfully fatigue rapidly sustaining short anaerobic bursts activity muscle contraction becomes painful contribute muscle strength greater potential increase mass type anaerobic glycolytic white muscle least dense mitochondria myoglobin small animals rodents major fast muscle type explaining pale color flesh

contraction
main article muscle contraction
three types muscle skeletal cardiac smooth significant differences however three movement actin myosin create contraction skeletal muscle contraction stimulated electrical impulses transmitted nerves motoneurons motor nerves particular cardiac smooth muscle contractions stimulated internal pacemaker cells regularly contract propagate contractions muscle cells contact skeletal muscle many smooth muscle contractions facilitated neurotransmitter acetylcholine




sarcomere contracts lines move closer together band becomes smaller band stays width full contraction thin thick filaments overlap


action muscle generates determined origin insertion locations crosssectional area muscle rather volume length determines amount force generate defining number sarcomeres operate parallel skeletal muscle contains long units called myofibrils myofibril chain sarcomeres since contraction occurs time connected sarcomeres muscles cell chains sarcomeres shorten together thus shortening muscle fiber resulting overall length change14 amount force applied external environment determined lever mechanics specifically ratio inlever outlever example moving insertion point biceps distally radius farther joint rotation would increase force generated flexion result maximum weight lifted movement decrease maximum speed flexion moving insertion point proximally closer joint rotation would result decreased force increased velocity easily seen comparing limb mole horse former insertion point positioned maximize force digging latter insertion point positioned maximize speed running
nervous control

muscle movement
efferent peripheral nervous system responsible conveying commands muscles glands ultimately responsible voluntary movement nerves move muscles response voluntary autonomic involuntary signals brain deep muscles superficial muscles muscles face internal muscles correspond dedicated regions primary motor cortex brain directly anterior central sulcus divides frontal parietal lobes
addition muscles react reflexive nerve stimuli always send signals brain case signal afferent fiber reach brain produces reflexive movement direct connections efferent nerves spine however majority muscle activity volitional result complex interactions various areas brain
nerves control skeletal muscles mammals correspond neuron groups along primary motor cortex brains cerebral cortex commands routed though basal ganglia modified input cerebellum relayed pyramidal tract spinal cord motor plate muscles along feedback extrapyramidal system contribute signals influence muscle tone response

since three factors affect muscular strength simultaneously muscles never work individually misleading compare strength individual muscles state strongest several muscles whose strength noteworthy different reasons

ordinary parlance muscular strength usually refers ability exert force external object—for example lifting weight definition masseter muscle strongest 1992 guinness book records records achievement bite strength 4337 seconds distinguishes masseter anything special muscle advantage working much shorter lever muscles
strength refers force exerted muscle place inserts bone strongest muscles largest crosssectional area tension exerted individual skeletal muscle fiber vary much fiber exert force order micronewton definition strongest muscle body usually said quadriceps femoris gluteus maximus
muscle strength determined crosssectional area shorter muscle stronger pound pound weight longer muscle crosssectional area myometrial layer uterus strongest muscle weight female human body time infant delivered entire human uterus weighs childbirth uterus exerts downward force contraction
external muscles conspicuously large strong relation small size weight eyeball frequently said strongest muscles sometimes claimed times stronger need however movements particularly saccades used facial scanning reading require high speed movements muscles exercised nightly rapid movement sleep
statement tongue strongest muscle body appears frequently lists surprising facts difficult find definition strength would make statement true note tongue consists eight muscles
heart claim muscle performs largest quantity physical work course lifetime estimates power output human heart range watts much less maximum power output muscles example quadriceps produce watts minutes heart work continuously entire lifetime without pause thus outwork muscles output watt continuously eighty years yields total work output half gigajoules18

exercise
main article physical exercise
exercise often recommended means improving motor skills fitness muscle bone strength joint function exercise several effects upon muscles connective tissue bone nerves stimulate muscles effect muscle hypertrophy increase size used bodybuilding
various exercises require predominance certain muscle fiber utilization another aerobic exercise involves long levels exertion muscles used well maximal contraction strength long periods time classic example marathon aerobic events rely primarily aerobic oxygen system higher percentage type slowtwitch muscle fibers consume mixture protein carbohydrates energy consume large amounts oxygen produce little lactic acid anaerobic exercise involves short bursts higher intensity contractions much greater percentage maximum contraction strength examples anaerobic exercise include sprinting weight lifting anaerobic energy delivery system uses predominantly type fasttwitch muscle fibers relies mainly glucose fuel consumes relatively little oxygen protein produces large amounts lactic acid sustained long period aerobic exercise many exercises partially aerobic partially anaerobic example soccer rock climbing involve combination
presence lactic acid inhibitory effect generation within muscle though producing fatigue inhibit even stop performance intracellular concentration becomes high however longterm training causes neovascularization within muscle increasing ability move waste products muscles maintain contraction moved muscles high concentrations within sarcomere lactic acid used muscles body tissues source energy transported liver converted back pyruvate addition increasing level lactic acid strenuous exercise causes loss potassium ions muscle causing increase potassium concentrations close muscle fibres interstitium acidification lactic acid allow recovery force acidosis protect fatigue rather cause fatigue19
delayed onset muscle soreness pain discomfort felt three days exercising generally subsides three days later thought caused lactic acid buildup recent theory caused tiny tears muscle fibers caused eccentric contraction unaccustomed training levels since lactic acid disperses fairly rapidly could explain pain experienced days exercise20
