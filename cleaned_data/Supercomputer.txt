early machines simple fastedit
early supercomputer architectures pioneered seymour cray relied compact designs local parallelism achieve superior computational performance11 cray noted increasing processor speeds little rest system also improve would waiting longer data arrive offboard storage units 6600 first massproduced supercomputer solved problem providing simple computers whose purpose read write data main memory allowing concentrate solely processing data made main units much simpler physically smaller reduced amount wiring various parts reduced electrical signaling delays allowed system higher clock speed 6600 outperformed machines average times introduced
6600s spot fastest computer eventually replaced successor 7600 design similar 6600 general organization added instruction pipelining improve performance generally speaking every computer instruction required several steps process first instruction read memory required data refers read instruction processed results written back memory steps normally accomplished separate circuitry early computers including 6600 steps runs turn unit currently active hardware handling parts process idle 7600 soon instruction cleared particular unit unit began processing next instruction although instruction takes time complete parts several instructions processed time offering muchimproved overall performance combined packaging improvements improvements electronics made 7600 four times fast 6600

cray meanwhile left formed company considering problems star designed improved version basic concept replaced stars memorybased vectors ones large registers combining famous packaging improvements produced cray1 completely outperformed every computer world save would ultimately sell units making successful supercomputer systems history 1970s series machines cray improved basic concepts

software development remained problem series sparked considerable research issue similar designs using custom hardware made many companies including evans sutherland maspar ncube intel ipsc goodyear mid1990s generalpurpose performance improved much supercomputer could built using individual processing units instead using custom chips turn 21st century designs featuring tens thousands commodity cpus norm later machines adding graphic units mix78
