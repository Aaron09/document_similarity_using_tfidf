functionedit
main article consumerresource systems
predators classified consumerresource interactions2 prey factors considered close predator prey host whether prey directly killed predator true predation parasitoidism involve certain death
true predationedit




lion eating african buffalo


true predator kills eats another living thing predators hunt actively prey pursuit predation wait prey approach within striking distance ambush predators predators kill large prey dismember chew prior eating jaguar human others prey whole bottlenose dolphin swallowing fish stork swallowing frog predation entails venom subdues prey predator ingests jellyfish disables cone shell cases venom contributes digestion prey rattlesnakes spiders contrast baleen whales millions microscopic plankton swallowing alive seed predation true predation seeds eggs potential organisms predators need prey entirely example predators cannot digest bones part organism still consistently cause death
grazingedit
main article grazing
grazing organisms generally kill prey herbivores like zooplankton live unicellular phytoplankton therefore inevitably kill many others small part plants graze many species plant adapted regrow grazing damage example growing meristems grasses tips flowering plants base leaves similarly kelp grazed subtidal kelp forests continuously regrows base blade animals also grazed upon female mosquitoes land hosts briefly feed blood3
parasitismedit




parasitoid strategy sooner later killing host compared typical parasite killing host predator killing prey immediately continuum


main article parasitism
parasites times difficult distinguish grazers feeding behavior similar many ways however noted close association host species grazing species elephant travel many kilometers single grazing many plants process parasites form close associations hosts usually lifetime close living arrangement described term symbiosis living together unlike mutualism association significantly reduces fitness host2 parasitic organisms range macroscopic mistletoe parasitic plant microscopic internal parasites cholera species however looser associations hosts lepidoptera butterfly moth larvae feed parasitically single plant graze several nearby plants therefore wise treat classification system continuum
parasitoidismedit
main article parasitoid
parasitoids organisms living host feeding directly upon eventually leading death much like parasites close symbiotic relationship host hosts like previous classifications parasitoid predators kill hosts instantly however unlike parasites similar true predators fate prey quite inevitably death wellknown example ichneumon wasps solitary insects living free life adult laying eggs another species caterpillar larvae feed growing host causing little harm first soon devouring internal organs finally destroying nervous system resulting prey death stage young wasps developed sufficiently move next stage life cycle though limited mainly insect orders hymenoptera diptera coleoptera parasitoids make much insect species45
ecological interactionsedit
specializationedit




platydemus manokwari flatworm predator land snails


information generalist specialist species
predators often highly specialized hunt species prey others opportunistic generalists leopards dogs alligators specialists usually particularly well suited capturing preferred prey prey turn often equally suited escape predator called evolutionary arms race tends keep populations species equilibrium predators specialize certain classes prey single species switch prey varying degrees success preferred target extremely scarce also resort scavenging herbivorous diet possible
trophic leveledit




secondary consumer action mantis tenodera aridifolia eating


also trophic level trophic dynamics
predators often another organisms prey likewise prey often predators though blue jays prey insects turn prey cats snakes snakes prey hawks classifying predators trophic level organisms feed autotrophs producers trophic pyramid known herbivores primary consumers feed heterotrophs animals known secondary consumers secondary consumers type carnivore also tertiary consumers eating carnivores quaternary consumers eating forth fraction energy passed next level hierarchy predation must somewhere seldom goes higher five levels example lion preys upon large herbivores wildebeest turn grasses predator food chain called apex predator examples include sperm whale komodo dragon tiger eagles owls many predators multiple levels food chain carnivore secondary tertiary consumers prey difficult classify similar reasons organisms showing carnivory herbivory known omnivores even herbivores giant panda supplement diet meat
competitionedit
alternative view offered richard dawkins predation form competition genes predator prey competing body survival machine prey organism6 best understood context gene centered view evolution another manner predation competition connected throughout intraguild predation intraguild predators kill predators different species trophic level thus potential competitors7
biodiversityedit




riparian willow recovery blacktail creek yellowstone national park reintroduction wolves


predators increase biodiversity communities preventing single species becoming dominant predators known keystone species profound influence balance organisms particular ecosystem8 introduction removal predator changes population density drastic cascading effects equilibrium many populations ecosystem example grazers grassland prevent single dominant species taking over9
elimination wolves yellowstone national park profound impacts trophic pyramid without predation herbivores began overgraze many woody browse species affecting areas plant populations addition wolves often kept animals grazing riparian areas protected beavers food sources encroached upon removal wolves direct effect beaver populations habitat became territory grazing10 furthermore predation keeps hydrological features creeks streams normal working order increased browsing willows conifers along blacktail creek lack predation caused channel incision helped slow water hold soil place10
optimal foragingedit
main articles optimal foraging theory consumerresource systems
successful predation results gain energy hunting invariably involves energetic costs hunger issue general predators seek attack prey since costs outweigh benefits instance large predatory fish like shark well aquarium typically ignore smaller fish swimming around prey fish take advantage fact apex predator apparently uninterested surplus killing represents deviation type behaviour treatment consumption terms costbenefit analysis known optimal foraging theory quite successful study animal behavior adaptations successful predators include speed built speed weapons sharp teeth claws camouflage avoid seen prey depth perception eyes front head judge size distance11
social predationedit




wolves cooperating hunt bison


social predation group predators cooperates kill creatures larger could overpower singly lions hyenas wolves dholes african wild dogs piranhas kill large herbivores social predation allows animals organize hunts creatures would easily escape single predator thus chimpanzees prey upon colobus monkeys cooperating group harriss hawks possible escapes rabbit12
sizeselective predationedit
sizeselective predation predators select prey certain size large prey prove troublesome predator small prey might prove hard find case provide less reward correlation size predators prey13 size also refuge large prey example adult elephants relatively safe predation lions juveniles vulnerable13

antipredator adaptationsedit




springbok stotting advertise ability escape


main article antipredator adaptation
many antipredator adaptations evolved prey populations selective pressures predation long periods time species predators cooperatively others thomsons gazelle stot signal predators cheetahs unprofitable chase14 many prey animals aposematically colored patterned warning predators distasteful able defend themselves15 distastefulness toxicity brought chemical defenses found wide range prey especially insects skunk dramatic mammalian example16 toxins useful adaptations prey utilized order ward predators toxins confused venom generally utilized predators difference venom usually means transfer delivery toxins refer ingestion toxins require method delivery unlike venom administered violent intentional process toxins generally compound cause destruction venom mixture different compounds target multiple tissues




camouflage dead leaf mantis makes less visible predators prey


camouflage consists color also shape pattern adaptation allows prey disrupt visual sensory mechanisms another organism visual perception cohered adaptations allowing prey unrecognized18 order organisms undetected need cryptic possessing cryptic abilities entails blending ones background countershading disruptive coloration disruptive coloration pattern allow predator discern body outline prey thus making undetectable19 background upon organism seen environment mantis resembling dead leaves organisms stripes zebra blending herd making difficult lions focus single target mimicry organism similar appearance another species drone resembles sting another example batesian mimicry moth automeris markings wings resemble owls eyes insectivorous predator disturbs moth reveals hind wings temporarily startling predator giving time escape predators also mimicry lure prey however female fireflies genus photuris example copy light signals species thereby attracting male fireflies captured eaten aggressive mimicry20
population dynamicsedit
predators tend lower survival fecundity prey higher level organization populations predator prey species also interact obvious predators depend prey survival reflected predator populations affected changes prey populations obvious however predators affect prey populations21 eating prey organism simply make room another prey population approaching carrying capacity
population dynamics predator–prey interactions modelled using lotka–volterra equations provide mathematical model cycling predator prey populations predators tend select young weak individuals22
evolutionedit
predation appears become major selection pressure shortly cambrian period—around million years ago—as evidenced almost simultaneous development calcification animals algae23 predationavoiding burrowing however predators grazing microorganisms since least 1000 million years ago2424252627
