gynoecium ancient greek γυνή gyne meaning woman οἶκος oikos meaning house commonly used collective term parts flower produce ovules ultimately develop fruit seeds gynoecium innermost whorl pistils flower typically surrounded pollenproducing reproductive organs stamens collectively called androecium gynoecium often referred female portion flower although rather directly producing female gametes cells gynoecium produces megaspores develops female gametophyte produces cells
term gynoecium also used botanists refer cluster archegonia associated modified leaves stems present gametophyte shoot mosses liverworts hornworts corresponding terms male parts plants clusters antheridia within androecium
flowers bear gynoecium stamens called pistillate carpellate flowers lacking gynoecium called staminate
gynoecium often referred female gives rise female eggproducing gametophytes however strictly speaking sporophytes gametophytes

monocarpous single carpel gynoecium context gynoecium whether composed single carpel multiple fused carpels typically made ovary style stigma center flower


gynoecium consist separate pistils pistil typically consists expanded basal portion called ovary elongated section called style apical structure receives pollen called stigma

ovary latin ovum meaning enlarged basal portion contains placentas ridges tissue bearing ovules integumented megasporangia placentas andor ovules born gynoecial appendages less frequently floral apex34567 chamber ovules develop called locule sometimes cell
style ancient greek stülos meaning pillar pillarlike stalk pollen tubes grow reach ovary flowers tulipa distinct style stigma sits directly ovary style hollow tube plants lilies transmitting tissue pollen tubes grow8
stigma ancient greek στίγμα stigma meaning mark puncture usually found style portion carpels receives pollen male gametophytes commonly sticky feathery capture pollen

word pistil comes latin pistillum meaning pestle sterile pistil male flower referred pistillode

carpel similar function megasporophyll typically includes stigma fused ovules enclosed enlarged lower portion ovary11
basal angiosperm lineages degeneriaceae winteraceae carpel begins shallow ovules develop laminar placentation upper surface carpel carpel eventually forms folded leaflike structure fully sealed margins style exists broad stigmatic crest along margin allows pollen tubes access along surface hairs margins11
