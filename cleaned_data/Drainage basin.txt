geopolitical boundariesedit
drainage basins historically important determining territorial boundaries particularly regions trade water important example english crown gave hudsons company monopoly trade entire hudson basin area called ruperts land bioregional political organization today includes agreements states international treaties within interstate compacts political entities particular drainage basin manage body bodies water drains examples interstate compacts great lakes commission tahoe regional planning agency

hydrology drainage basin logical unit focus studying movement water within hydrological cycle majority water discharges basin outlet originated precipitation falling basin portion water enters groundwater system beneath drainage basin flow towards outlet another drainage basin groundwater flow directions always match overlying drainage network measurement discharge water basin made stream gauge located basins outlet
rain gauge data used measure total precipitation drainage basin different ways interpret data gauges many evenly distributed area uniform precipitation using arithmetic mean method give good results thiessen polygon method drainage basin divided polygons rain gauge middle polygon assumed representative rainfall area land included polygon polygons made drawing lines gauges making perpendicular bisectors lines form polygons isohyetal method involves contours equal precipitation drawn gauges calculating area curves adding volume water time consuming
isochrone maps used show time taken runoff water within drainage basin reach lake reservoir outlet assuming constant uniform effective rainfall78910
geomorphologyedit
drainage basins principal hydrologic unit considered fluvial geomorphology drainage basin source water sediment moves higher elevation river system lower elevations reshape channel forms
ecologyedit




mississippi river drains largest area river much agricultural regions agricultural runoff water pollution flows outlet cause hypoxic dead zone gulf mexico


drainage basins important ecology water flows ground along rivers pick nutrients sediment pollutants water transported towards outlet basin affect ecological processes along well receiving water source
modern artificial fertilizers containing nitrogen phosphorus potassium affected mouths drainage basins minerals carried drainage basin mouth accumulate disturbing natural mineral balance cause eutrophication plant growth accelerated additional material
resource managementedit
information watershed management
drainage basins coherent entities hydrological sense become common manage water resources basis individual basins state minnesota governmental entities perform function called watershed districts zealand called catchment boards comparable community groups based ontario canada called conservation authorities north america function referred watershed management brazil national policy water resources regulated 9433 1997 establishes drainage basin territorial division brazilian water management
river basin crosses least political border either border within nation international boundary identified transboundary river management basins becomes responsibility countries sharing nile basin initiative omvs senegal river mekong river commission examples arrangements involving management shared river basins
management shared drainage basins also seen build lasting peaceful relationships among countries11
catchment factorsedit
catchment significant factor determining amount likelihood flooding
catchment factors topography shape size soil type land paved roofed areas catchment topography shape determine time taken rain reach river catchment size soil type development determine amount water reach river
topographyedit
generally topography plays part fast runoff reach river rain falls steep mountainous areas reach primary river drainage basin faster flat lightly sloping areas gradient
shapeedit
shape contribute speed runoff reaches river long thin catchment take longer drain circular catchment
sizeedit
size help determine amount water reaching river larger catchment greater potential flooding also determined basis length width drainage basin
soil typeedit
soil type help determine much water reaches river certain soil types sandy soils freedraining rainfall sandy soil likely absorbed ground however soils containing clay almost impermeable therefore rainfall clay soils contribute flood volumes prolonged rainfall even freedraining soils become saturated meaning rainfall reach river rather absorbed ground surface impermeable precipitation create surface runoff lead higher risk flooding ground permeable precipitation infiltrate soil
land useedit
land contribute volume water reaching river similar clay soils example rainfall roofs pavements roads collected rivers almost absorption groundwater
