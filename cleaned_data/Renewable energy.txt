heat pump device provides heat energy source heat destination called heat sink heat pumps designed move thermal energy opposite direction spontaneous heat flow absorbing heat cold space releasing warmer solarassisted heat pump represents integration heat pump thermal solar panels single integrated system typically technologies used separately placing parallel produce water178 system solar thermal panel performs function temperature heat source heat produced used feed heat pumps evaporator179 goal system high produce energy efficient less expensive


possible type solar thermal panel sheet tubes rollbond heat pipe thermal plates hybrid monopolycrystalline thin film combination heat pump hybrid panel preferable allows cover part electricity demand heat pump reduce power consumption consequently variable costs system


artificial photosynthesis


artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology store solar electromagnetic energy chemical bonds splitting water produce hydrogen using carbon dioxide make methanol180 researchers field striving design molecular mimics photosynthesis utilize wider region solar spectrum employ catalytic systems made abundant inexpensive materials robust readily repaired nontoxic stable variety environmental conditions perform efficiently allowing greater proportion photon energy storage compounds carbohydrates rather building sustaining living cells181 however prominent research faces hurdles catalytix spinoff stopped scaling prototype fuelcell 2012 offers savings ways make hydrogen sunlight182


algae fuels

electric aircraft aircraft runs electric motors rather internal combustion engines electricity coming fuel cells solar cells ultracapacitors power beaming183 batteries


currently flying manned electric aircraft mostly experimental demonstrators though many small unmanned aerial vehicles powered batteries electrically powered model aircraft flown since 1970s report 1957184185 first mancarrying electrically powered flights made 1973186 20152016 manned solarpowered plane solar impulse completed circumnavigation earth187


solar updraft tower


solar updraft tower renewableenergy power plant generating electricity temperature solar heat sunshine heats beneath wide greenhouselike roofed collector structure surrounding central base tall chimney tower resulting convection causes updraft tower chimney effect airflow drives wind turbines placed chimney updraft around chimney base produce electricity plans scaledup versions demonstration models allow significant power generation allow development applications water extraction distillation agriculture horticulture advanced version similarly themed technology vortex engine aims replace large physical chimneys vortex created shorter lessexpensive structure


spacebased solar power


either photovoltaic thermal systems option loft space particularly geosynchronous orbit competitive earthbased solar power systems specific mass kgkw times cost loft mass plus cost parts needs 2400 less parts cost plus rectenna 1100kw product kgkw must 1300kw less188 thus kgkw transport cost cannot exceed 200kg require reduction spacex targeting reduction reaction engines make reduction possible
