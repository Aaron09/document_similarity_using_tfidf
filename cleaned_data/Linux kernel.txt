linus torvalds


april 1991 linus torvalds time 21yearold computer science student university helsinki finland started working simple ideas operating system started task switcher intel 80386 assembly language terminal driver august 1991 torvalds posted following composminix newsgroup usenet18

free operating system hobby wont professional like 386486 clones brewing since april starting ready like feedback things people likedislike minix resembles somewhat physical layout filesystem practical reasons among things
currently ported bash108 gcc140 things seem work implies something practical within months free minix code multithreaded portable uses task switching probably never support anything atharddisks thats
mostly people wouldnt call write uses every conceivable feature could find also project teach already mentioned uses paging disk segmentation segmentation makes really dependent every task 64mb segment code data tasks anybody needs 64mbtask tough cookies cfiles specifically almost much assembler unlike minix also happen like interrupts interrupts handled without trying hide reason behind

many people contributed code project early minix community contributed code ideas linux kernel time project created many components required free operating system kernel hurd incomplete unavailable operating system freed legal encumbrances despite limited functionality early versions linux rapidly gained developers users

tanenbaum–torvalds debateedit
main article tanenbaum–torvalds debate
fact linux monolithic kernel rather microkernel topic debate andrew tanenbaum creator minix linus torvalds28 debate started 1992 usenet discussion group composminix linux kernel architecture general29 tanenbaum argued microkernels superior monolithic kernels therefore linux obsolete unlike traditional monolithic kernels device drivers linux easily configured loadable kernel modules loaded unloaded running system subject revisited 200630 2006 tanenbaum wrote position statement31
popularityedit
huge rise popularity android operating system includes linux kernel made kernel popular choice mobile devices rivaling installed base operating systems323334 including previous years three billion android smartphones estimated sold 2014
many consumer routers also linux kernel35 well wide variety embedded devices smart settop boxes webcams many desktop linux distributions including linux kernel exist usage share linux distributions comparison operating systems
legal aspectsedit
licensing termsedit
initially torvalds released linux license forbade commercial use36 changed version switch general public license gpl20 license allows distribution sale possibly modified unmodified versions linux requires copies released license accompanied complete corresponding source code
torvalds described licensing linux best thing ever did36
version 3edit
linux kernel licensed explicitly version gpl6 without offering licensee option choose later version common extension considerable debate easily license could changed later versions including version whether change even desirable37 torvalds specifically indicated upon release version code released version however terms state version specified version used39 alan pointed linux contributors specified particular version gpl40
september 2006 survey kernel programmers indicated preferred gplv2 thencurrent gplv3 draft torvalds commented think number outsiders believed personally publicly huge gplv341 group highprofile kernel developers including linus torvalds greg kroahhartman andrew morton commented mass media objections gplv342 referred clauses regarding drmtivoization patents additional restrictions warned balkanisation open source universe gplv34243 linus torvalds decided adopt gplv3 linux kernel reiterated criticism even years later44
loadable kernel modulesedit
debated whether loadable kernel modules lkms considered derivative works copyright thereby fall terms
torvalds stated belief lkms using limited public subset kernel interfaces sometimes nonderived works thus allowing binaryonly drivers lkms licensed gplcitation needed good example usage dmabuf proprietary nvidia graphics drivers dmabuf recent kernel feature like rest kernel licensed allows multiple gpus quickly copy data others framebuffers45 possible case would nvidia optimus pairs fast intel integrated nvidia writes intel framebuffer active nvidia cannot infrastructure uses technical means enforce rule used lkms also alan replied lkml rejecting request engineers remove technical enforcement api46 linux kernel contributors agree interpretation however even torvalds agrees many lkms clearly derived works indeed writes kernel modules derivative default47
hand torvalds also said gray area particular something like driver originally written another operating system clearly derived work linux origin gray area area personally believe modules considered derived works simply werent designed linux dont depend special linux behaviour48 proprietary graphics drivers particular heavily discussed ultimately likely questions resolved court
firmware binary blobsedit
point licensing controversy firmware binary blobs linux kernel support several hardware devices files variety licenses many restrictive exact underlying source code usually unknown8
2002 richard stallman stated point view blobs make linux kernel partially nonfree software distributing linux kernel violates requires complete corresponding source code available7 2008 free software foundation latin america started linuxlibre project creates completely free variant linux kernel without proprietary objects used certain completely free linux distributions endorsed free software foundation also used distributions49
december 2010 debian project announced next debian stable version squeeze would come kernel stripped nonfree firmware bits50 policy continued applied later stable debian releases
trademarkedit
also linux copyright trademark naming
linux registered trademark linus torvalds united states countries result incident william della croce involved linux project trademarked name subsequently demanded royalties use51 several linux backers retained legal counsel filed suit della croce issue settled august 1997 trademark assigned linus torvalds5253
litigationedit
details topic scolinux controversies

early 2007 filed specific details purported copyright infringement despite previous claims rightful owner million lines code specified lines code uncopyrightable54 august 2007 court novell case ruled actually unix copyrights begin with55 though tenth circuit court appeals ruled august 2009 question owned copyright properly remained jury answer56 jury case decided march 2010 novells favour57

revision controledit
linux kernel source code used maintained without help automated source code management system mostly linus torvalds dislike centralized systems
2002 linux kernel development switched bitkeeper system satisfied torvalds technical requirements bitkeeper made available linus several others free charge free software source controversy system provide interoperability free systems subversion
april 2005 efforts reverseengineer bitkeeper system andrew tridgell bitmover company maintained bitkeeper stop supporting linux development community response torvalds others wrote source code control system purpose called system written within weeks months first official kernel release made using git326 soon developed separate project right gained widespread adoption
version numberingedit
linux kernel three different numbering schemes
first scheme used runup first version kernel followed first version 10327 many patch releases versions
release prior version number composed number denoted kernel version number denoted major revision kernel number indicated minor revision kernel kernel version changed major changes code concept kernel occurred twice history kernel 1994 version 1996 version version released 2011 major change kernel concept major revision assigned according even–odd version numbering scheme minor revision changed whenever security patches fixes features drivers implemented kernel
2004 version released kernel developers held several discussions regarding release version scheme328329 ultimately linus torvalds others decided much shorter timebased release cycle would beneficial seven years first numbers remained third number incremented release rolled three months fourth number sometimes added account security fixes kernel version evenodd system alternation stable unstable gone instead development prereleases titled release candidates indicated appending suffix kernel version followed ordinal number
first fourth number occurred grave error required immediate fixing encountered 268s code however enough changes legitimize release minor revision would 2681 released change error 2611 adopted official versioning policy later became customary continuously backport major bugfixes security patches released kernels indicate updating fourth number
2011 linus torvalds announced330 kernel version would bumped release following 2639 minor version number getting large commemorate 20th anniversary linux continued timebased release practice introduced using second number example would follow months additional number third number would added necessary designate security fixes example 3018 linux community refers versioning major version number also later raised release following version 319331b
addition linuss development releases sometimes version suffix indicating another development branch usually always initials person made example stands kolivas stands alan sometimes letters related primary development area branch kernel built example indicates wireless networking test build also distributors suffixes different numbering systems backports enterprise stable older distribution versions
