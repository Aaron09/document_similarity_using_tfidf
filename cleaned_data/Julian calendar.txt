motivation
ordinary year previous roman calendar consisted months total days addition 28day intercalary month mensis intercalaris sometimes inserted february march intercalary month formed inserting days first days february last five days february counted toward start march became last five days intercalaris effect days year forming intercalary year days10 mensis intercalaris always days began either first second terminalia february11
according later writers censorinus macrobius ideal intercalary cycle consisted ordinary years days alternating intercalary years alternately days long system average roman year would ​366 days four years giving average drift year relative solstice equinox macrobius describes refinement whereby 8year period within 24year cycle three intercalary years days thus intercalary years refinement averages length year 36525 days years
practice intercalations occur systematically according ideal systems determined pontifices determined historical evidence much less regular ideal schemes suggest usually occurred every second third year sometimes omitted much longer occasionally occurred consecutive years
managed correctly system could allowed roman year stay roughly aligned tropical year however since pontifices often politicians roman magistrates term office corresponded calendar year power prone abuse pontifex could lengthen year political allies office refuse lengthen opponents power12
many intercalations omitted happened second punic civil wars calendar would drift alignment tropical year moreover intercalations often determined quite late average roman citizen often know date particularly distance city reasons last years prejulian calendar later known years confusion problems became particularly acute years julius caesars pontificate reform 63–46 five intercalary months instead eight none five roman years
caesars reform intended solve problem permanently creating calendar remained aligned without human intervention proved useful soon calendar came effect varro used calendar dates start four seasons would impossible years earlier13 century later pliny dated winter solstice december entered degree capricorn date14 stability become ordinary fact life
context reform
although approximation ​365 days tropical year known long time15 ancient solar calendars used less precise periods resulting gradual misalignment calendar seasons
octaeteris cycle lunar years popularised cleostratus also commonly attributed eudoxus used early greek calendars notably athens days longer eight julian years length nineteen years cycle meton 6940 days hours longer mean julian year mean julian year basis 76year cycle devised callippus student eudoxus improve metonic cycle
persia iran reform persian calendar introduction persian zoroastrian young avestan calendar afterwards first year farvardinnowruz slipped vernal equinox rate approximately every four years1617
likewise egyptian calendar fixed year days drifting four years unsuccessful attempt extra every fourth year made decree canopus caesar probably experienced wandering vague calendar country landed nile delta october soon became embroiled ptolemaic dynastic especially cleopatra managed introduced alexandria
caesar imposed peace banquet held celebrate event18 lucan depicted caesar talking wise called acoreus feast stating intention create calendar perfect eudoxus18 eudoxus popularly credited determined length year ​365 days19 soon resumed caesar attacked egyptian army several months achieved victory enjoyed long cruise nile cleopatra leaving country june bc20
caesar returned rome according plutarch called best philosophers mathematicians time solve problem calendar21 pliny says caesar aided reform astronomer sosigenes alexandria22 generally considered principal designer reform sosigenes also author astronomical almanac published caesar facilitate reform23 eventually decided establish calendar would combination roman months fixed length egyptian calendar ​365 days greek astronomy according macrobius caesar assisted certain marcus flavius24
julian reform
realignment year
first step reform realign start calendar year january tropical year making days long compensating intercalations missed caesars pontificate year already extended days insertion regular intercalary month february caesar decreed reform probably shortly return african campaign late quintilis july added days inserting extraordinary intercalary months november december25
months called intercalaris prior intercalaris posterior letters cicero written time basis statement sometimes seen called undecimber duodecimber26 individual lengths unknown position nones ides within them27
last series irregular years extralong year referred last year confusion calendar began operation realignment completed bc28
changes months
julian months formed adding days regular prejulian roman year days creating regular julian year days extra days added january sextilis august december extra added april june september november february changed ordinary years continued traditional days thus ordinary leap year lengths months julian calendar values still hold today sacroboscos theory month lengths stories purporting otherwise
julian reform change method used account days month prejulian calendar based kalends nones ides change positions three dates within months macrobius states extra days added immediately last month avoid disturbing position established religious ceremonies relative nones ides month29 however since roman dates ides month counted toward start next month extra days effect raising initial value count following ides lengthened months thus january sextilis december 14th month became instead xvii april june september november became xviii
romans time born ides month responded differently effect change birthdays mark antony kept birthday january changed date xvii date previously existed livia kept date birthday unchanged moved january previously existed augustus kept september date viii celebrated places
inserted days initially characterised dies fasti roman calendar30 character festival days changed early julioclaudian period large number festivals decreed celebrate events dynastic importance caused character associated dates changed however practice discontinued around reign claudius practice characterising days fell disuse around first century antonine jurist gaius speaks dies nefasti thing past31
intercalation
intercalary month abolished leap dated ante diem sextum kalendas martias sixth doubled kalends march usually abbreviated mart hence called english bissextile year occurred termed annus bissextus english bissextile year
debate exact position bissextile early julian calendar earliest direct evidence statement century jurist celsus states halves 48hour intercalated posterior half inscription states mart bissextile 19th century chronologist ideler argued celsus used term posterior technical fashion refer earlier days requires inscription refer whole 48hour bissextile later historians share view others following mommsen take view celsus using ordinary latin english meaning posterior third view neither half 48hour sextum originally formally designated intercalated need arose concept 48hour became obsolete32
doubt bissextile eventually became earlier days purposes censorinus stated inserted terminalia february followed last five days february prid mart would february common year 25th 29th leap year hence regarded bissextum first half doubled later writers including macrobius bede medieval computists calculators easter followed rule liturgical calendar roman catholic church however celsus definition continued used legal purposes incorporated justinians digest33 english statute anno bissextili 1236 formally repealed 1879
effect bissextile nundinal cycle discussed sources according cassius leap inserted ensure first market fall january implies 8day cycle immediately affected julian reform however also reports previous occasions market changed avoid conflict religious festival indicate single nundinal letter assigned halves 48hour bissextile time regifugium market might fall date different days case 8day nundinal cycle began displaced 7day week first century dominical letters began appear alongside nundinal letters fasti34
late middle ages days month came numbered consecutive order consequently leap considered last february leap years february current position
sacroboscos theory month lengths
julian reform lengths months modern values however 13thcentury scholar sacrobosco proposed different explanation lengths julian months35 still widely repeated certainly wrong
according sacrobosco month lengths ordinary years roman republican calendar january december



sacrobosco thought julius caesar added every month except february total days regular months giving ordinary julian year days single leap could added extra short february

2930

said augustus changed taking february sextilis modifying alternation following months

2829

length augustus august would shorter therefore inferior length iulius july giving irregular month lengths still
abundant evidence disproving theory first wall painting roman calendar predating julian reform survived36 confirms literary accounts months already irregular julius caesar reformed ordinary year days month lengths arranged



also julian reform change dates nones ides particular ides late 15th rather 13th march july october showing months always days roman calendar37 whereas sacroboscos theory requires march july originally days long length october changed days caesar days augustus sacroboscos theory explicitly contradicted century authors censorinus38 macrobius39 inconsistent seasonal lengths given varro writing bc13 sextilis renamed augustus 31day sextilis given egyptian papyrus bc40 28day february shown fasti caeretani dated bc41
