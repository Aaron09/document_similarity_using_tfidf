introductionedit
biological works particularly dealing taxonomy nomenclature also ecological surveys long custom full citations place scientific name published omitted shorthand used cite author name least first time mentioned author name frequently sufficient information help resolve difficulties problems include

name taxon referred ambiguous case homonyms ficus tree genus ficus röding 1798 genus molluscs
publication name littleknown journal book author name sometimes help resolve
name validly published supposed author name helpful locate publication manuscript listed

rules recommendations author citations botany covered articles 4650 international code nomenclature icn1 stated article botanical code botany normal cite author taxon name indicated published work even though differ stated authorship publication
basic citationedit
simplest form author citation botany applies name cited original rank original genus placement binomial names original author authors names cited parentheses included
latin term ampersand symbol used authors jointly publish name1recommendation 46c1
many cases author citation consist parts first parentheses

helianthemum coridifolium vill cout

form author citation indicates epithet originally published another genus case cistus coridifolius first author dominique villars indicated enclosing parentheses moved present genus helianthemum second revising author antónio xavier pereira coutinho alternatively revising author changed rank taxon example raising subspecies species vice versa subgenus section etc1article latter contrast situation zoology authorship change recognized within familygroup genusgroup speciesgroup names thus change subspecies species subgenus genus associated change cited authorship
abbreviationedit
citing botanical name including author authors name often abbreviated encourage consistency international code nomenclature algae fungi plants recommends1recommendation note brummitt powells authors plant names 1992 author botanical name assigned unique abbreviation2 standard abbreviations found international plant names index3
example

rubus

abbreviation refers famous botanist carl linnaeus described genus species plantarum 1753

rubus ursinus cham schldl

abbreviation cham refers botanist adelbert chamisso schldl botanist diederich franz leonhard schlechtendal authors jointly described species placed genus rubus 1827
usage term exedit
component author citation denotes fact initial description satisfy rules valid publication name subsequently validly published second author authors author subsequent publication1article however subsequent author makes clear description earlier author earlier author accepted name used earlier author listed alone example

andropogon aromaticus sieber schult

indicates josef schultes validly published name 1824 instance description based earlier description franz sieber note botany author earlier name precedes later valid zoology sequence present reversed
examplesedit
following forms citation equally correct

helianthemum apenninum mill subsp rothmaleri villar rothm mmayor fernbenito
helianthemum conquense borja rivas goday glópez mateo vjarán resó

usage ancillary term inedit
ancillary term sometimes employed indicate authorship published work different name example

verrucaria aethiobola wahlenb acharius methodus suppl 1803

article note botanical code indicates cases portion commencing fact bibliographic citation used without place publication included thus preferred form nameauthor alone example would verrucaria aethiobola wahlenb verrucaria aethiobola wahlenb acharius contrast situation zoology either form permissible addition date would normally appended
authorship subsidiary ranksedit
according botanical code necessary cite author lowest rank taxon question example subspecies given helianthemum apenninum subsp rothmaleri necessary even recommended cite authority species mill well subspeciescitation needed though found sources exception rule nominate variety subspecies species cited automatically inherit authorship parent taxon1article thus

second example excl abbr exclusis varietatibus indicates taxonomic concept excludes varieties workers subsequently included
indicationsedit
indications encountered appended scientific name authorship include indications nomenclatural taxonomic status illeg sensu smith prior taxonomic status taxa transferred hybrid nonhybrid status hybr article botanical code technically form part author citation represent supplementary text however sometimes included authority fields less well constructed taxonomic databases specific examples given recommendations 50af botanical code include

carex bebbii olney nomen nudum alternatively

taxon name published without acceptable description diagnosis

lindera thunb 1783 adans 1763

homonym indicating instance carl peter thunbergs lindera taxon named previously michel adanson correspondence names coincidental

bartlingia brongn paris 1827 rchb 1824 fmuell 1882

prior quite possibly unrelated homonyms noted first ludwig reichenbach second ferdinand mueller

betula alba 1753

taxon name rejected normally favour later usage placed list rejected names forming appendix botanical code alternative name conserved rejected name would cited cons

ficus exasperata auct vahl

preferred syntax name misapplied subsequent author authors auct auctt actually represents different taxon vahls name correctly applies

spathiphyllum solomonense nicolson amer 1967 solomonensis

indicating epithet originally published spelled solomonensis spelling altered form presumably code compliance legitimate reason
