internet explorer uses doctype sniffing choose standards mode quirks mode deliberately mimicks nonstandard behaviours versions msie html rendering screen internet explorer always uses standards mode printing also provides dialect ecmascript called jscript
internet explorer criticised bernerslee limited support promoted w3c42
nonstandard extensionsedit
internet explorer introduced array proprietary extensions many standards including html resulted number pages appear broken standardscompliant browsers introduced need quirks mode allow rendering improper elements meant internet explorer browsers
internet explorer introduced number extensions adopted browsers include innerhtml property provides access html string within elementcitation needed xmlhttprequest object allows sending http request receiving http response used perform ajax designmode attribute contentdocument object enables rich text editing html documentscitation needed functionalities possible introduction methods ruby character extension html also accepted module xhtml though found versions html
microsoft submitted several features consideration standardization include behaviour property connects html elements jscript behaviours known html components htmltime profile adds timing media synchronization support html documents similar xhtmlsmil vector graphics file format however rejected least original forms subsequently combined pgml proposed adobe resulting w3capproved format vector image formats used support version
nonstandard behaviours include support vertical text syntax different css3 candidate recommendation support variety image effects44 page transitions found support obfuscated script code particular jscriptencode45 support embedding fonts pages46
faviconedit
support favicons first added internet explorer internet explorer supports favicons static native windows icon formats windows vista later internet explorer display native windows icons embedded files4849
usability accessibilityedit
internet explorer makes accessibility framework provided windows internet explorer also user interface operations similar windows explorer popup blocking tabbed browsing added respectively internet explorer internet explorer tabbed browsing also added older versions installing search toolbar yahoo toolbar
cacheedit
main articles temporary internet files indexdat
internet explorer caches visited content temporary internet files folder allow quicker access offline access previously visited pages content indexed database file known indexdat multiple indexdat files exist index different contentâ€”visited content feeds visited urls cookies etc50
prior clearing cache used clear index files reliably removed posing potential security privacy risk later cache cleared cache files reliably removed indexdat file overwritten null bytes

architectureedit




architecture previous versions similar architecture except tabs within process consequently browser window could process


internet explorer uses componentized architecture built component object model technology consists several major components contained separate dynamiclink library exposes programming interfaces hosted internet explorer main executable iexploreexe52

wininetdll protocol handler http https handles network communication protocols
urlmondll responsible mimetype handling download content provides threadsafe wrapper around wininetdll protocol implementations
mshtmldll houses trident rendering engine introduced internet explorer responsible displaying pages onscreen handling document object model pages mshtmldll parses htmlcss file creates internal tree representation also exposes apis runtime inspection modification tree tree processed layout engine renders internal representation screen
ieframedll contains user interface window internet explorer
shdocvwdll provides navigation local caching history functionalities browser
browseuidll responsible rendering browser user interface menus toolbars53

internet explorer include native scripting functionality rather mshtmldll exposes permits programmer develop scripting environment pluggedin access tree internet explorer includes bindings active scripting engine part microsoft windows allows language implemented active scripting module used clientside scripting default jscript vbscript modules provided third party implementations like screamingmonkey ecmascript support also used microsoft also makes available microsoft silverlight runtime supported windows allows languages including dlrbased dynamic languages like ironpython ironruby used clientside scripting
internet explorer introduces major architectural changes called loosely coupled lcie lcie separates main window process frame process processes hosting different applications different tabs processes frame process create multiple processes different integrity level process host multiple sites processes asynchronous interprocess communication synchronize generally single frame process sites windows vista protected mode turned however opening privileged content local html pages create process constrained protected mode54
extensibilityedit
also component object model browser helper object
internet explorer exposes component object model interfaces allows addons extend functionality browser52 extensibility divided types browser extensibility content extensibility browser extensibility involves adding context menu entries toolbars menu items browser helper objects bhos used extend feature browser whereas extensibility options used expose feature user interface content extensibility adds support nonnative content formats52 allows internet explorer handle file formats protocols webm spdy52 addition pages integrate widgets known activex controls windows vast potentials extend content capabilities adobe flash player microsoft silverlight examples52 addons installed either locally directly site
since malicious addons compromise security system internet explorer implements several safeguards internet explorer service pack later feature addon manager enabling disabling individual addons complemented addons mode starting windows vista internet explorer bhos restricted privileges isolated rest system internet explorer introduced component addon performance advisor addon performance advisor shows notification installed addons exceed preset performance threshold notification appears notification user launches browser windows windows introduce metrostyle version internet explorer entirely sandboxed addons all55 addition windows cannot download install activex controls although existing ones bundled windows still traditional version internet explorer55
internet explorer hosted applications interfaces used embed browser functionality inside computer program create internet explorer shells52
securityedit
also browser security
internet explorer uses zonebased security framework groups sites based certain conditions including whether internet intranetbased site well usereditable whitelist security restrictions applied zone sites zone subject restrictions
internet explorer onwards uses attachment execution service microsoft windows mark executable files downloaded internet potentially unsafe accessing files marked prompt user make explicit trust decision execute file executables originating internet potentially unsafe helps preventing accidental installation malware
internet explorer introduced phishing filter restricts access phishing sites unless user overrides decision version also blocks access sites known host malware downloads also checked known malwareinfected
windows vista internet explorer default runs called protected mode privileges browser severely restrictedâ€”it cannot make systemwide changes optionally turn mode recommended also effectively restricts privileges addons result even browser addon compromised damage security breach cause limited
patches updates browser released periodically made available windows update service well automatic updates although security patches continue released range platforms feature additions security infrastructure improvements made available operating systems microsofts mainstream support phase
december 2008 trend micro recommended users switch rival browsers emergency patch released potential security risk could allow outside users take control persons computer steal passwords microsoft representatives countered recommendation claiming internet sites affected flaw
december 2008 security problem became available release security update internet explorer kb960714 available microsoft windows updates webpage microsoft said update fixes security risk found trend micro previous day5657
