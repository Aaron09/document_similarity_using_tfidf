notesedit

authors require ring semigroup multiplication require multiplicative identity section notes definition details
elements multiplicative inverses called units lang 2002 §ii1
closure axiom already implied condition binary operation authors therefore omit axiom lang 2002
transition integers rationals adding fractions generalized quotient field
many authors include commutativity rings ring axioms therefore refer commutative rings rings
