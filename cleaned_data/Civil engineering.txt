civil engineers typically possess academic degree civil engineering length study three five years completed degree designated bachelor engineering bachelor science engineering curriculum generally includes classes physics mathematics project management design specific topics civil engineering taking basic courses subdisciplines civil engineering move onto specialize subdisciplines advanced levels undergraduate degree bengbsc normally provides successful students industryaccredited qualification academic institutions offer postgraduate degrees mengmsc allow students specialize particular area interest15
countries bachelors degree engineering represents first step towards professional certification professional body certifies degree program completing certified degree program engineer must satisfy range requirements including work experience exam requirements certified certified engineer designated professional engineer united states canada south africa chartered engineer commonwealth countries chartered professional engineer australia zealand european engineer countries european union international agreements relevant professional bodies allow engineers practice across national borders
benefits certification vary depending upon location example united states canada licensed professional engineer prepare sign seal submit engineering plans drawings public authority approval seal engineering work public private clients16 requirement enforced provincial engineers quebec17
legislation enacted countries including united kingdom australia state licensing engineers limited state queensland almost certifying bodies maintain code ethics members must abide by18
engineers must obey contract contractual relationships parties cases engineers work fails subject tort negligence extreme cases criminal charges19 engineers work must also comply numerous rules regulations building codes environmental
