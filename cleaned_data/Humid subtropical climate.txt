warm temperate summer climate zones world according modified köppen climate classification uses threshold coldest month





humid subtropical climate zone climate characterized humid summers mild winters climates normally southeast side continents generally latitudes located poleward adjacent tropical climates many subtropical climates tend located near coastal locations cases extend inland notably china united states
köppen climate classification climates either described humid subtropical climates mild temperate climates climate features mean temperatures coldest month mean temperatures warmest month higher however climatologists opted describe climate type humid subtropical climate1 köppen never used term humid subtropical climate classification officially created trewartha climate classification
trewartha system 1966 update köppen climate classification sought redefine middle latitude climates smaller zones original köppen system grouped middle latitude climates single zone trewartha climate classification climates termed humid subtropical monthly mean temperatures higher eight months year least month mean temperature trewartha system humid subtropical climates typically occupy southernmost portions temperate zone north south latitude2
rainfall often shows summer peak especially monsoons well developed southeast asia florida areas uniform varying rainfall cycles consistently lack predictably summer months summer rainfall occurs thunderstorms build intense surface heating strong subtropical angle weak tropical lows move adjacent warm tropical oceans well infrequent tropical storms often contribute summer seasonal rainfall peaks winter rainfall often associated large storms westerlies fronts reach subtropical latitudes however many subtropical climates southeast asia florida winters frequent brush fires water shortages
