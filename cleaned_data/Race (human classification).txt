race concept used categorization humans groups called races racial groups based combinations shared physical traits ancestry genetics social cultural traits although groupings lack firm basis modern biology continue strong influence contemporary social relations123456 first used refer speakers common language denote national affiliations 17th century race began refer physical phenotypical traits term often used general biological taxonomic sense7 starting 19th century denote genetically differentiated human populations defined phenotype89
social conceptions groupings races vary time involving folk taxonomies10 define essential types individuals based perceived traits scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete11 generally discourage racial explanations collective differentiation physical behavioral traits1213141516
even though broad scientific agreement essentialist typological conceptualizations race untenable scientists around world continue conceptualize race widely differing ways essentialist implications17 researchers concept race make distinctions among fuzzy sets traits observable differences behaviour others scientific community suggest idea race often used naive12 simplistic way18 argue among humans race taxonomic significance pointing living humans belong species homo sapiens applicable subspecies homo sapiens sapiens1920
since second half 20th century association race ideologies theories scientific racism word race becoming problematicaccording although still used general contexts race often replaced less ambiguous loaded terms populations peoples ethnic groups communities depending context721

defining race
modern scholarship views racial categories socially constructed race intrinsic human beings rather identity created establish meaning social context22 racial identities reflect cultural attitudes imperial powers dominant european colonial expansion3 view rejects notion race biologically defined23242526272829excessive citations nonetheless biologists argue racial categories correlate biological traits phenotype certain genetic markers varying frequencies among human populations correspond less traditional racial groupings reason current consensus whether racial categories considered significance understanding human genetic variation30undue weight discuss
people define talk particular conception race create social reality social categorization achieved31 sense races said social constructs32 constructs develop within various legal economic sociopolitical contexts effect rather cause major social situations33 race understood social construct many scholars agree race real material effects lives people institutionalized practices preference discrimination
socioeconomic factors combination early enduring views race considerable suffering within disadvantaged racial groups34 racial discrimination often coincides racist mindsets whereby individuals ideologies group come perceive members outgroup racially defined morally inferior35 result racial groups possessing relatively little power often find excluded oppressed hegemonic individuals institutions charged holding racist attitudes36 racism many instances tragedy including slavery genocide37
countries enforcement uses race profile suspects racial categories frequently criticized perpetuating outmoded understanding human biological variation promoting stereotypes societies racial groupings correspond closely patterns social stratification social scientists studying social inequality race significant variable sociological factors racial categories part reflect subjective attributions selfidentities social institutions3839
