december 1950 chinese intervention repelled command armies northern north korea general lawton collins army chief staff general macarthur admiral turner general george stratemeyer staff officers major general doyle hickey major general charles willoughby major general edwin wright tokyo plan strategy countering chinese intervention considered three potential atomic warfare scenarios encompassing next weeks months warfare173

first scenario continued attacking full command forbidden blockade bomb china without reinforcements without increase forces april 1951 four national guard divisions arrive atomic bombs might used north korea173
second scenario continued full attacks command blockaded china effective aerial reconnaissance bombing chinese interior soldiers maximally exploited tactical atomic bombing hand forces could hold positions deep north korea173
third scenario china agreed cross 38th parallel border general macarthur recommended acceptance armistice disallowing troops south parallel requiring guerrillas withdraw northwards eighth army would remain protect seoul–incheon area corps would retreat pusan commission supervise implementation armistice173

ridgway authorized nuclear weapons major attack originated outside korea envoy sent hong kong deliver warning china message likely caused chinese leaders cautious potential nuclear weapons whether learned deployment unclear failure major chinese offensives month likely caused shift defensive strategy korea b29s returned united states june333
despite greater destructive power deploying atomic weapons would bring effects determining wars outcome would likely minimal tactically given dispersed nature chinese north korean forces relatively primitive infrastructure staging logistics centers small number bombs available would conserved soviets atomic attacks would limited effects ability china mobilize move forces strategically attacking chinese cities destroy civilian industry infrastructure would cause immediate dispersion leadership away areas give propaganda value communists galvanize support chinese civilians since soviets expected intervene primitive atomic weapons china north koreas behalf used first factors little operational value lowering threshold using atomic weapons nonnuclear states future conflicts played role employing threat possible nuclear exchange342
