since symbols example alphanumeric characters continuous representing symbols digitally rather simpler conversion continuous analog information digital instead sampling quantization analogtodigital conversion techniques polling encoding used
symbol input device usually consists group switches polled regular intervals switches switched data lost within single polling interval switches pressed switch pressed released pressed polling done specialized processor device prevent burdening main symbol entered device typically sends interrupt specialized format read
devices switches buttons joystick status encoded bits usually released pressed single word useful combinations presses meaningful sometimes used passing status modifier keys keyboard shift control scale support keys number bits single byte word
devices many switches computer keyboard usually arrange switches scan matrix individual switches intersections lines switch pressed connects corresponding lines together polling often called scanning case done activating line sequence detecting lines signal thus keys pressed keyboard processor detects changed state sends signal indicating scan code state symbol encoded converted number based status modifier keys desired character encoding
custom encoding used specific application loss data however using standard encoding ascii problematic symbol needs converted standard

statesedit
digital data come three states data rest data transit data confidentiality integrity availability managed entire lifecycle birth destruction data
properties digital informationedit
digital information possesses common properties distinguish analog data respect communications

synchronization since digital information conveyed sequence symbols ordered digital schemes method determining beginning sequence written spoken human languages synchronization typically provided pauses spaces capitalization punctuation machine communications typically special synchronization sequences
language digital communications require formal language context consists information sender receiver digital communication must possess advance order communication successful languages generally arbitrary specify meaning assigned particular symbol sequences allowed range values methods used synchronization
errors disturbances noise analog communications invariably introduce generally small deviation error intended actual communication disturbances digital communication result errors unless disturbance large result symbol misinterpreted another symbol disturb sequence symbols therefore generally possible entirely errorfree digital communication techniques check codes used detect errors guarantee errorfree communications redundancy retransmission errors digital communications take form substitution errors symbol replaced another symbol insertiondeletion errors extra incorrect symbol inserted deleted digital message uncorrected errors digital communications unpredictable generally large impact information content communication
copying inevitable presence noise making many successive copies analog communication infeasible generation increases noise digital communications generally errorfree copies copies made indefinitely
granularity digital representation continuously variable analog value typically involves selection number symbols assigned value number symbols determines precision resolution resulting datum difference actual analog value digital representation known quantization error example actual temperature 23234456544453 degrees digits assigned parameter particular digital representation quantizing error 0234456544453 property digital communication known granularity
compressible according miller uncompressed digital data large form would actually produce larger signal therefore difficult transfer analog data however digital data compressed compression reduces amount bandwidth space needed send information data compressed sent decompressed site consumption makes possible send much information result example digital television signals offering room airwave spectrum television channels4

historical digital systemsedit
even though digital signals generally associated binary electronic digital systems used modern electronics computing digital systems actually ancient need binary electroniccitation needed

morse code uses digital states—dot dash intracharacter dash short letter medium words long sentences—to send messages variety potential carriers electricity light example using electrical telegraph flashing light
braille system first binary format character encoding using sixbit code rendered patterns
flag semaphore uses rods flags held particular positions send messages receiver watching distance away
