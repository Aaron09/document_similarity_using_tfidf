biotic reefedit
variety biotic reef types including oyster reefs massive widely distributed tropical coral reefs although corals major contributors framework bulk material comprising coral reef organisms responsible reef growth constant assault ocean waves calcareous algae especially although entirely species coralline algae
biotic reef types take additional names depending upon reef lies relation land reef types include fringing reef barrier reefs well atolls fringing reef reef attached island barrier reef forms calcareous barrier around island resulting lagoon shore reef atoll ring reef land present reef front ocean side high energy locale whereas internal lagoon lower energy fine grained sediments
