development
1971 engineers yuma shiraishi shizuo takano together team develop consumerbased vtr15 1971 created internal diagram titled development matrix established twelve objectives jvcs vtr16 included

system must compatible ordinary television
picture quality must similar normal broadcast
tape must least twohour recording capacity
tapes must interchangeable machines
overall system versatile meaning scaled expanded connecting video camera recorders
recorders affordable easy operate maintenance costs
recorders must capable produced high volume parts must interchangeable must easy service

early 1972 commercial video recording industry japan took financial budgets restructured video division shelving project however despite lack funding takano shiraishi continued work project secret 1973 engineers produced functional prototype16
