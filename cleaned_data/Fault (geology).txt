mechanisms faultingedit




normal fault herradura formation morro solar peru light layer rock shows displacement second normal fault right


also fault mechanics
friction rigidity constituent rocks planes cannot glide flow past easily occasionally movement stops thus stress builds reaches level exceeds strain threshold accumulated potential energy released fault
strain occurs accumulatively instantaneously depending liquid state rock ductile lower crust mantle accumulate deformation gradually shearing whereas brittle upper crust reacts fracture instantaneous stress release resulting motion along fault fault ductile rocks also release instantaneously strain rate great energy released instantaneous strainrelease causes earthquakes
slip heave throwedit

slip defined relative movement geological features present either side fault plane faults sense slip defined relative motion rock side fault respect side3 measuring horizontal vertical separation throw fault vertical component separation heave fault horizontal component throw heave out4




microfault showing piercing point coins diameter


vector slip qualitatively assessed studying drag folding strataclarification needed visible either side fault direction magnitude heave throw measured finding common intersection points either side fault called piercing point practice usually possible find slip direction faults approximation heave throw vector

main types fault rock include

cataclasite fault rock cohesive poorly developed absent planar fabric incohesive characterised generally angular clasts rock fragments finergrained matrix similar composition

tectonic fault breccia medium coarsegrained cataclasite containing visible fragments
fault gouge incohesive clayrich fine ultrafinegrained cataclasite possess planar fabric containing visible fragments rock clasts present

clay smear clayrich fault gouge formed sedimentary sequences containing clayrich layers strongly deformed sheared fault gouge
