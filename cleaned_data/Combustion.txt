combustion kəmˈbʌstʃən burning1 hightemperature exothermic redox chemical reaction fuel reductant oxidant usually atmospheric oxygen produces oxidized often gaseous products mixture termed smoke combustion fire produces flame heat produced make combustion selfsustaining combustion often complicated sequence elementary radical reactions solid fuels wood coal first undergo endothermic pyrolysis produce gaseous fuels whose combustion supplies heat required produce combustion often enough light form either glowing flame produced simple example seen combustion hydrogen oxygen water vapor reaction commonly used fuel rocket engines reaction releases kjmol heat reduces enthalpy accordingly constant temperature pressure




combustion organic fuel always exothermic double bond much weaker double bonds pairs single bonds therefore formation stronger bonds combustion products results release energy2 bond energies fuel play minor role since similar combustion products bond energies nearly heat combustion approximately mole used combustion reaction estimated elemental composition fuel2

since combustion nitrogen thermodynamically favored high temperatures since combustion rarely clean flue cleaning catalytic converters required
fires occur naturally ignited lightning strikes volcanic products combustion fire first controlled chemical reaction discovered humans form campfires bonfires continues main method produce energy humanity usually fuel carbon hydrocarbons complicated mixtures wood contains partially oxidized hydrocarbons thermal energy produced combustion either fossil fuels coal renewable fuels firewood harvested diverse uses cooking production electricity industrial domestic heating combustion also currently reaction used power rockets combustion also used destroy incinerate waste nonhazardous hazardous
