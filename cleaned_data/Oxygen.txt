phlogiston theory

oxygen first discovered swedish pharmacist carl wilhelm scheele produced oxygen heating mercuric oxide various nitrates 1771–210114 scheele called fire known supporter combustion wrote account discovery manuscript titled treatise fire sent publisher 1775 document published 177712

french chemist antoine laurent lavoisier later claimed discovered substance independently priestley visited lavoisier october 1774 told experiment liberated scheele also posted letter lavoisier september 1774 described discovery previously unknown substance lavoisier never acknowledged receiving copy letter found scheeles belongings death12

lavoisiers contribution
