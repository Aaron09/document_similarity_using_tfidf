potatoes contain toxic compounds known glycoalkaloids prevalent solanine chaconine solanine also found plants family solanaceae includes plants deadly nightshade atropa belladonna henbane hyoscyamus niger tobacco nicotiana well eggplant tomato compounds protect plant predators general concentrated leaves stems sprouts fruits contrast roots40 summary several studies glycoalkaloid content highest flowers sprouts lowest tuber flesh order highest lowest content generally flowers sprouts leaves skin roots berries peel skin plus outer cortex tuber flesh stems tuber flesh41
exposure light physical damage increase glycoalkaloid content within tuber42 cooking high temperatures—over °f—partly destroys compounds concentration glycoalkaloid wild potatoes suffices produce toxic effects humans glycoalkaloids cause headaches diarrhea cramps severe cases coma death however poisoning potatoes occurs rarely light exposure causes greening chlorophyll synthesis thus giving visual clue areas tuber become toxic however provide definitive guide greening glycoalkaloid accumulation occur independently varieties contain different levels glycoalkaloids lenape variety released 1967 withdrawn 1970 contained high levels glycoalkaloids43 since breeders developing varieties test sometimes discard otherwise promising cultivar
