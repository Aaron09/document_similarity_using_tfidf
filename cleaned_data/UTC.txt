mechanism
divides time days hours minutes seconds days conventionally identified using gregorian calendar julian numbers also used contains hours hour contains minutes number seconds minute usually occasional leap second instead13 thus time scale second smaller time units millisecond microsecond constant duration minute larger time units hour week variable duration decisions introduce leap second announced least months advance bulletin produced international earth rotation reference systems service1415 leap seconds cannot predicted advance unpredictable rate rotation earth16

history
1884 international meridian conference held washington local mean solar time royal observatory greenwich england chosen define universal counted hours mean midnight agreed civil greenwich mean time used island great britain since 1847 contrast astronomical began mean noon hours mean midnight date january 1925 whereas nautical began mean noon hours mean midnight date least 1805 royal navy persisted much later elsewhere mentioned 1884 conference 1884 greenwich meridian used twothirds charts maps prime meridian27 1928 term universal time introduced international astronomical union refer starting midnight28 1950s broadcast time signals based hence rotation earth
1955 caesium atomic clock invented provided form timekeeping stable convenient astronomical observations 1956 national bureau standards naval observatory started develop atomic frequency time scales 1959 time scales used generating time signals named shortwave radio station broadcasts 1960 naval observatory royal greenwich observatory national physical laboratory coordinated radio broadcasts time steps frequency changes coordinated resulting time scale informally referred coordinated universal time29
controversial decision frequency signals initially match rate kept frequency atomic clocks deliberately allowed drift away divergence grew significantly signal phase shifted stepped bring back agreement twentynine steps used 196030
1958 data published linking frequency caesium transition newly established ephemeris second ephemeris second duration time used independent variable laws motion govern movement planets moons solar system cause laws motion accurately predict observed positions solar system bodies within limits observing accuracy ephemeris seconds constant length atomic seconds publication allowed value chosen length atomic second would work properly celestial laws motion31
1961 bureau international lheure began coordinating process internationally name coordinated universal time formally adopted international astronomical union 19673233 time steps occurred every months thereafter frequency changes year jumps increased size intended permit close approximation ut229
1967 second redefined terms frequency supplied caesium atomic clock length second defined practically equal second ephemeris time34 frequency provisionally used since 1958 soon recognised types second different lengths namely second second used idea thought would better time signals maintain consistent frequency frequency match second thus would necessary rely time steps alone maintain approximation tried experimentally service known stepped atomic time ticked rate used jumps stay synchronised ut235
also dissatisfaction frequent jumps 1968 louis essen inventor caesium atomic clock winkler independently proposed steps only36 system eventually approved along idea maintaining second equal second 1971 final irregular jump exactly 0107758 seconds january 1972 000000 january 1972 000010 exactly making difference integer number seconds time tick rate changed exactly match also started track rather time signals started broadcast dut1 correction applications requiring closer approximation provided3738

rationale




graph showing difference dut1 seconds vertical segments correspond leap seconds


earths rotational speed slowly decreasing tidal deceleration increases length mean solar length second calibrated basis second ephemeris time3134 seen relationship mean solar observed 1750 1892 analysed simon newcomb result second close 186400 mean solar mid‑19th century40 earlier centuries mean solar shorter 86400 seconds recent centuries longer 86400 seconds near 20th century length mean solar also known simply length approximately 864000013 reason slower difference excess msday
excess nominal 86400 accumulates time causing initially synchronised mean become desynchronised ahead near 20th century nominal value faster getting second ahead roughly every days thus leap seconds inserted approximately interval retarding keep synchronised long term42 actual rotational period varies unpredictable factors tectonic motion observed rather computed
adding leap every four years mean year getting longer every four years insertion leap second every days indicate mean solar getting longer second every days take 50000 years mean solar lengthen second rate mscy means century rate fluctuates within range 17–23 mscy rate tidal friction alone mscy uplift canada scandinavia several metres since last temporarily reduced mscy last 2700 years43 correct reason leap seconds current difference actual nominal rather accumulation difference period time near 20th century difference 1800 second therefore days accumulated second leap second added
graph dut1 excess nominal 86400 corresponds downward slope graph vertical segments slope became shallower 2000s decade slight acceleration earths crust temporarily shortening vertical position graph corresponds accumulation difference time vertical segments correspond leap seconds introduced match accumulated difference leap seconds timed keep dut1 within vertical range depicted graph frequency leap seconds therefore corresponds slope diagonal graph segments thus excess
future
also leap second
earths rotation continues slow positive leap seconds required frequently longterm rate change approximately century 21st century roughly 86400004 requiring leap seconds every days several centuries frequency leap seconds become problematic
time 22nd century leap seconds required every year current leap second opportunities june december insufficient march september options used 25th century four leap seconds required every year current quarterly options insufficient thereafter need possibility leap seconds month thousand years even insufficient leap seconds month44 tens thousands years timing uncertain exceed 86401 causing require leap second
april 2001 seaman national optical astronomy observatory proposed leap seconds allowed added monthly rather twice yearly45
proposal redefine abolish leap seconds sundials would slowly sync civil time46 resulting gradual shift suns movements relative civil time analogous shift seasons relative yearly calendar results calendar year precisely matching tropical year length would major practical change civil timekeeping would take effect slowly several centuries would ahead would coincide local mean time along meridian drifting slowly eastward reaching paris beyond47 thus time system would lose fixed connection geographic coordinates based iers meridian difference could reach hour year 2600 hours around 460044
itu‑r study group working party unable reach consensus whether advance proposal 2012 radiocommunications assembly chairman study group elected advance question 2012 radiocommunications assembly january 201248 consideration proposal postponed world radio conference 2015 convening november49
