potter work jaura madhya pradesh india


clay ware takes varying physical characteristics making pottery

greenware refers unfired objects sufficient moisture content bodies stage plastic form soft malleable hence easily deformed handling
leatherhard refers clay body dried partially stage clay object approximately moisture content clay bodies stage firm slightly pliable trimming handle attachment often occurs leatherhard state
bonedry refers clay bodies reach moisture content near ready bisque fired
bisque67 refers clay object shaped desired form fired kiln first time known bisque fired biscuit fired firing changes clay body several ways mineral components clay body undergo chemical changes change colour clay
glaze fired final stage pottery making glaze applied bisque form object decorated several ways object glazed fired causes glaze material melt adhere object glaze firing also harden body still chemical processes continue occur body

kaolin sometimes referred china clay first used china used porcelain
ball clay extremely plastic fine grained sedimentary clay contain organic matter small amounts added porcelain increase plasticity
fire clay clay slightly lower percentage fluxes kaolin usually quite plastic highly heat resistant form clay combined clays increase firing temperature used ingredient make stoneware type bodies
stoneware clay suitable creating stoneware clay many characteristics fire clay ball clay finer grain like ball clay heat resistant like fire clays
common clay shale clay vegetable ferric oxide impurities make useful bricks generally unsatisfactory pottery except special conditions particular deposit9
