dating historical eventsedit
descriptions astronomical phenomena date historical events began 16th century time renewed humanistic interest history increasingly precise astronomical tables1 eclipses particular relatively infrequent events dated precisely circumstances exact descriptions leave ambiguities often details month eclipse position stars planets identify specific eclipse2
astronomical dating like forms historical interpretation requires care interpreting surviving written records john steele proposed three questions must asked dating event record refer actual astronomical event merely modern assumption refer actual astronomical event source reliable record provide unambiguous date without making unwarranted assumptions ancient astronomical observational methods3
babylonian astronomical diaries provide detailed unambiguous accounts positions visible planets often relation specific stars used provide precise dates events like defeat darius alexander great battle gaugamela october alexanders subsequent death june 3234
since success method depends reliability written sources precision accounts astronomical phenomena attempts date literary texts describe astronomical events loosely even metaphors researchers conclusions appear precise rely invalid assumptions consequently less widely accepted thus attempts date vedic texts describing pleiades rising east 2300 time pleiades rose exactly east complicated fact poetic descriptions need taken reflecting precise astronomical observations precession slow process makes small changes azimuth star rising east5

ninth century diagram positions seven planets march


among artifacts readily dated astronomical techniques depictions positions celestial bodies particular time since motions celestial bodies different periods takes many centuries planets plus moon reach positions signs zodiac configuration accurate ±15° within single sign positions seven bodies return configuration 3700 years particular case involved medieval illuminated manuscript portrayed position seven celestial bodies march corresponding period manuscript written calculation demonstrated illustration copy earlier classical depiction position stars6 rapidly moving moon sensitive indicator exact time estimate indicated position moon within degree time diagram computed within hour7
striking example method astrological portrait christopher hatton 1540–1591 depicted positions seven classical planets zodiac noted computed positions planets nearest minute largest source error date uncertainty 16thcentury astronomical calculations resulting time noon december 15818
dating structures orientationedit
controversial archaeoastronomical approach used date structures believed oriented astronomical principles measuring orientation computing date past single specified celestial body whether selected star rises sets measured azimuth astronomer norman lockyer applied method stonehenge9 measuring orientation stonehenge avenue comparing position solstitial sunrise changes slowly changing obliquity ecliptic archaeologist penrose applied similar method ancient greek temples attempting establish dates relating orientation appearance stars horizon position changes slowly precession equinoxes10
wide variance dates historically accepted ones architect archaeologist william bell dinsmoor mistrust dates established slowly changing obliquity ecliptic stellar alignments involve arbitrary selection star rises proper azimuth instead proposed method employing already known historical records concerning dates construction greek temples festivals associated specific temples nature greek lunisolar calendar since date festival greek lunisolar calendar recurs date solar calendar every eight nineteen years dinsmoor identified festival connected specific temple able determine exact year near historically recorded construction date rose alignment temple date festival11
