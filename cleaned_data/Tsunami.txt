tsunami warning bilingual sign ulee lheue banda aceh acehnese indonesian


tsunami
term tsunami meaning harbour wave literal translation comes japanese composed kanji meaning harbour nami meaning wave plural either follow ordinary english practice invariable plural japanese9 entirely accurate tsunami restricted harbours tsunami currently term widely accepted geologists oceanographers
tidal wave




tsunami aftermath aceh indonesia december 2004


tsunamis sometimes referred tidal waves10 oncepopular term derives common appearance tsunami extraordinarily high tidal bore tsunamis tides produce waves water move inland case tsunami inland movement water much greater giving impression incredibly high forceful tide recent years term tidal wave fallen favour especially scientific community tsunamis nothing tides produced gravitational pull moon rather displacement water although meanings tidal include resembling11 form character of12 tides term tidal wave discouraged geologists oceanographers
seismic wave
term seismic wave also used refer phenomenon waves often generated seismic activity earthquakes13 prior rise term tsunami english scientists generally encouraged term seismic wave rather tidal wave however like tsunami seismic wave completely accurate term forces earthquakes including underwater landslides volcanic eruptions underwater explosions land slumping ocean meteorite impacts weather atmospheric pressure changes rapidly generate waves displacing water1415

early greek historian thucydides inquired book history peloponnesian causes tsunami first argue ocean earthquakes must cause78

cause opinion phenomenon must sought earthquake point shock violent driven back suddenly recoiling redoubled force causes inundation without earthquake accident could happen18

roman historian ammianus marcellinus gestae 261015–19 described typical sequence tsunami including incipient earthquake sudden retreat following gigantic wave tsunami devastated alexandria1920
causes
principal generation mechanism cause tsunami displacement substantial volume water perturbation sea21 displacement water usually attributed either earthquakes landslides volcanic eruptions glacier calvings rarely meteorites nuclear tests2223 waves formed sustained gravityhow
seismicity
tsunami generated floor abruptly deforms vertically displaces overlying water tectonic earthquakes particular kind earthquake associated earths crustal deformation earthquakes occur beneath water deformed area displaced equilibrium position24 specifically tsunami generated thrust faults associated convergent destructive plate boundaries move abruptly resulting water displacement owing vertical component movement involved movement normal extensional faults also cause displacement seabed largest events typically related flexure outer trench swell cause enough displacement give rise significant tsunami 1977 sumba 1933 sanriku events2526

energy released produces tsunami waves




tsunamis small amplitude wave height offshore long wavelength often hundreds kilometres long whereas normal ocean waves wavelength metres27 generally pass unnoticed forming slight swell usually millimetres normal surface grow height reach shallower water wave shoaling process described tsunami occur tidal state even tide still inundate coastal areas
april 1946 aleutian islands earthquake occurred maximum mercalli intensity strong generated tsunami inundated hilo island hawaii 14metre high surge killed area earthquake occurred pacific ocean floor subducting pushed downwards alaska

landslides
1950s discovered larger tsunamis previously believed possible could caused giant submarine landslides rapidly displace large water volumes energy transfers water rate faster water absorb existence confirmed 1958 giant landslide lituya alaska caused highest wave ever recorded height metres 1700 feet28 wave travel struck land almost immediately people fishing killed another boat managed ride wave
another landslidetsunami event occurred 1963 massive landslide monte entered vajont italy resulting wave surged high metres destroyed several towns around 2000 people died2930 scientists named waves megatsunamis
geologists claim large landslides volcanic islands cumbre vieja palma canary islands able generate megatsunamis cross oceans disputed many others
general landslides generate displacements mainly shallower parts coastline conjecture nature large landslides enter water shown subsequently affect water enclosed bays lakes landslide large enough cause transoceanic tsunami occurred within recorded history susceptible locations believed island hawaii fogo cape verde islands reunion indian ocean cumbre vieja island palma canary islands along volcanic ocean islands large masses relatively unconsolidated volcanic material occurs flanks cases detachment planes believed developing however growing controversy dangerous slopes actually are31
meteotsunamis
meteorological conditions especially rapid changes barometric pressure seen passing front displace bodies water enough cause trains waves wavelengths comparable seismic tsunamis usually lower energies essentially dynamically equivalent seismic tsunamis differences meteotsunamis lack transoceanic reach significant seismic tsunamis force displaces water sustained length time meteotsunamis cant modelled caused instantaneously spite lower energies shorelines amplified resonance sometimes powerful enough cause localised damage potential loss life documented many places including great lakes aegean english channel balearic islands common enough local name rissaga sicily called marubbio nagasaki called abiki examples destructive meteotsunamis include march 1979 nagasaki june 2006 menorca latter causing damage tens millions euros32
meteotsunamis confused storm surges local increases level associated barometric pressure passing tropical cyclones confused setup temporary local raising level caused strong onshore winds storm surges setup also dangerous causes coastal flooding severe weather dynamics completely unrelated tsunami waves32 unable propagate beyond sources waves

characteristics




wave enters shallow water slows amplitude height increases






wave slows amplifies hits land largest waves crest


tsunamis cause damage mechanisms smashing force wall water travelling high speed destructive power large volume water draining land carrying large amount debris even waves appear large
everyday wind waves wavelength crest crest metres height roughly metres tsunami deep ocean much larger wavelength kilometres wave travels well kilometres hour owing enormous wavelength wave oscillation given point takes minutes complete cycle amplitude metre ft35 makes tsunamis difficult detect deep water ships unable feel passage
velocity tsunami calculated obtaining square root depth water metres multiplied acceleration gravity approximated example pacific ocean considered depth 5000 metres velocity tsunami would square root √5000 √50000 metres second feet second equates speed kilometres hour miles hour formula used calculating velocity shallow waves tsunami behaves like shallow wave peak peak value reaches floor ocean surface
reason japanese name harbour wave sometimes villages fishermen would sail encounter unusual waves fishing come back land find village devastated huge wave
tsunami approaches coast waters become shallow wave shoaling compresses wave speed decreases kilometres hour wavelength diminishes less kilometres amplitude grows enormously accord greens since wave still long period tsunami take minutes reach full height except largest tsunamis approaching wave break rather appears like fastmoving tidal bore36 open bays coastlines adjacent deep water shape tsunami steplike wave steepbreaking front
tsunamis wave peak reaches shore resulting temporary rise level termed measured metres reference level36 large tsunami feature multiple waves arriving period hours significant time wave crests first wave reach shore highest up37
tsunamis occur pacific ocean possible wherever large bodies water including lakes caused earthquakes landslides volcanic explosions glacier calvings bolides
