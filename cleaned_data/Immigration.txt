push factors refer primarily motive immigration country origin case economic migration usually labor migration differentials wage rates common value wages country surpasses value wages ones native country choose migrate long costs high particularly 19th century economic expansion increased immigrant flow nearly population foreign born12 thus making significant amount labor force
transportation technology improved travel time costs decreased dramatically 18th early 20th century travel across atlantic used take weeks 18th century around time 20th century took mere days13 opportunity cost lower immigration rates tend higher13 escape poverty personal relatives staying behind traditional push factor availability jobs related pull factor natural disasters amplify povertydriven migration flows research shows middleincome countries higher temperatures increase emigration rates urban areas countries lowincome countries higher temperatures reduce emigration14
emigration immigration sometimes mandatory contract employment religious missionaries employees transnational corporations international nongovernmental organizations diplomatic service expect definition work overseas often referred expatriates conditions employment typically equal better applying host country similar workcitation needed
