types transcriptionedit
principal types brackets used transcriptions

square brackets used phonetic notations possibly including details pronunciation used distinguishing words language transcribed author nonetheless wishes document
slashes used phonemic notations note features distinctive language without extraneous detail

example sounds spin pronounced slightly differently english difference would meaningful languages difference meaningful english thus phonemically words spɪn phoneme however capture difference allophones transcribed phonetically pʰɪn spɪn
conventions less commonly seen

double slashes pipes double pipes braces used around word denote underlying structure abstract even phonemes morphophonology examples
double square brackets used extraprecise transcription indicate letter cardinal value example open front vowel rather perhaps slightly different value open central used transcribe particular language thus vowels transcribed easy legibility clarified actually ⟦e̝⟧ precisely ⟦ð̠̞ˠ⟧19
angle brackets used clarify letters represent original orthography language sometimes exact transliteration nonlatin script within letters indicated sound values carry example ⟨pin⟩ ⟨spin⟩ would seen words contain sound letter italics perhaps commonly used purpose full words written spin sufficiently clear individual letters digraphs20
braces used prosodic notation extensions international phonetic alphabet examples system
parentheses used indistinguishable utterances also seen silent articulation mouthing expected phonetic transcription derived lipreading periods indicate silent pauses example
double parentheses indicate obscured unintelligible sound syll syll⸩ audible unidentifiable syllables
