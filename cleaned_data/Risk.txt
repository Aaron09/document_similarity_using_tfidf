risk uncertaintyedit
seminal work risk uncertainty profit frank knight 1921 established distinction risk uncertainty

uncertainty must taken sense radically distinct familiar notion risk never properly separated term risk loosely used everyday speech economic discussion really covers things functionally least causal relations phenomena economic organization categorically different essential fact risk means cases quantity susceptible measurement times something distinctly character farreaching crucial differences bearings phenomenon depending really present operating appear measurable uncertainty risk proper shall term different unmeasurable effect uncertainty accordingly restrict term uncertainty cases nonquantitive type60

thus knightian uncertainty immeasurable possible calculate knightian sense risk measurable
another distinction risk uncertainty proposed douglas hubbard6162

uncertainty lack complete certainty existence possibility true outcomestateresultvalue known
measurement uncertainty probabilities assigned possibilities example chance market double five years
risk state uncertainty possibilities involve loss catastrophe undesirable outcome
measurement risk possibilities quantified probabilities quantified losses example chance proposed well loss million exploratory drilling costs

sense uncertainty without risk risk without uncertainty uncertain winner contest unless personal stake risk money outcome contest risk cases outcome measure uncertainty refers probabilities assigned outcomes measure risk requires probabilities outcomes losses quantified outcomes
risk attitude appetite toleranceedit

gambling riskincreasing investment wherein money hand risked possible large return possibility losing purchasing lottery ticket risky investment high chance return small chance high return contrast putting money bank defined rate interest riskaverse action gives guaranteed return small gain precludes investments possibly higher gain possibility getting return investment also known rate ruin
risk vector quantityedit
hubbard also argues defining risk product impact probability presumes unrealistically decisionmakers riskneutral62page needed riskneutral persons utility proportional expected value payoff example riskneutral person would consider chance winning million exactly desirable getting certain 200000 however decisionmakers actually riskneutral would consider equivalent choices gave rise prospect theory cumulative prospect theory hubbard proposes instead describe risk vector quantity distinguishes probability magnitude risk risks simply described functionvague possible payoffs gains losses associated probabilities array collapsed scalar value according decisionmakers risk tolerance
