overviewedit
molecular biophysics typically addresses biological questions similar biochemistry molecular biology seeking find physical underpinnings biomolecular phenomena scientists field conduct research concerned understanding interactions various systems cell including interactions protein biosynthesis well interactions regulated great variety techniques used answer questions
fluorescent imaging techniques well electron microscopy xray crystallography spectroscopy atomic force microscopy smallangle scattering xrays neutrons saxssans often used visualize structures biological significance protein dynamics observed neutron spin echo spectroscopy conformational change structure measured using techniques dual polarisation interferometry circular dichroism saxs sans direct manipulation molecules using optical tweezers also used monitor biological events forces distances nanoscale molecular biophysicists often consider complex biological events systems interacting entities understood statistical mechanics thermodynamics chemical kinetics drawing knowledge experimental techniques wide variety disciplines biophysicists often able directly observe model even manipulate structures interactions individual molecules complexes molecules
addition traditional molecular cellular biophysical topics like structural biology enzyme kinetics modern biophysics encompasses extraordinarily broad range research bioelectronics quantum biology involving experimental theoretical tools becoming increasingly common biophysicists apply models experimental techniques derived physics well mathematics statistics larger systems tissues organs populations ecosystems biophysical models used extensively study electrical conduction single neurons well neural circuit analysis tissue whole brain
