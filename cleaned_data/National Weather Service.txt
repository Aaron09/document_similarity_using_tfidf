silver spring maryland


1870 weather bureau united states established joint resolution congress signed president ulysses grant8 mission provide taking meteorological observations military stations interior continent points states territoriesand giving notice northern great lakes seacoast magnetic telegraph marine signals approach force storms agency placed secretary congress felt military discipline would probably secure greatest promptness regularity accuracy required observations within department assigned army signal service brigadier general albert myer general myer gave national weather service first name division telegrams reports benefit commerce9
cleveland abbe began developing probabilistic forecasts using daily weather data sent cincinnati chamber commerce western union convinced back collection information 1869 appointed bureaus first chief meteorologist earlier role civilian assistant chief signal service abbe urged department research weather conditions provide scientific basis behind forecasts would continue urge study meteorology science becoming weather bureau chief debate went signal service congress whether forecasting weather conditions handled civilian agencies signal services existing forecast office congressional committee formed oversee matter recommending offices operations transferred department following twoyear investigation10
agency first became civilian enterprise 1890 became part department agriculture oversight branch bureau began issuing flood warnings fire weather forecasts output first daily national surface weather maps also established network distribute warnings tropical cyclones well data exchange service relayed european weather analysis bureau vice versa11 first weather bureau radiosonde launched massachusetts 1937 prompted switch routine aircraft observation radiosondes within years bureau prohibited word tornado used weather products concern inciting panic move contradicted intentions high death tolls past tornado outbreaks lack advanced warning 1938 began disseminating tornado warnings exclusively emergency management personnel12
bureau would later moved department commerce 194013 july 1950 bureau chief francis reichelderfer officially lifted agencys public tornado alerts circular letter noting first order stations weather bureau employees avoid statements interpreted negation bureaus willingness ability make tornado forecasts good probability verification exist issuing forecasts difficulty accurately predicting tornadic activity14 however would faced criticism continuing refuse provide public tornado warnings preventing release usaf severe weather warning centers tornado forecasts pioneered 1948 force capt robert miller major ernest fawbush beyond military personnel bureau issued first experimental public tornado forecasts march 195212 1957 bureau began using radars shortterm forecasting local storms hydrological events using modified versions used navy aircraft create wsr57 weather surveillance radar 1957 network systems deployed nationwide early 1960s15 radars upgraded wsr74 models beginning 1974
