granite

igneous rock



granite containing potassium feldspar plagioclase feldspar quartz biotite andor amphibole



composition


potassium feldspar plagioclase feldspar quartz differing amounts muscovite biotite hornblendetype amphiboles


granite ˈɡrænɪt common type felsic intrusive igneous rock granular phaneritic texture granites predominantly white pink gray color depending mineralogy word granite comes latin granum grain reference coarsegrained structure holocrystalline rock strictly speaking granite igneous rock quartz volume least total feldspar consisting alkali feldspar although commonly term granite used refer wider range coarse grained igneous rocks containing quartz feldspar
term granitic means granitelike applied granite group intrusive igneous rocks similar textures slight variations composition origin rocks mainly consist feldspar quartz mica amphibole minerals form interlocking somewhat equigranular matrix feldspar quartz scattered darker biotite mica amphibole often hornblende peppering lighter color minerals occasionally individual crystals phenocrysts larger groundmass case texture known porphyritic granitic rock porphyritic texture known granite porphyry granitoid general descriptive field term lightercolored coarsegrained igneous rocks petrographic examination required identification specific types granitoids1 extrusive igneous rock equivalent granite rhyolite2
granite nearly always massive lacking internal structures hard tough therefore gained widespread throughout human history construction stone average density granite gcm3 1654 1717 lbft33 compressive strength usually lies viscosity near 1019 pa·s4
melting temperature granite ambient pressure 1215–1260 2219–2300 strongly reduced presence water kbar pressure6
granite poor primary permeability overall strong secondary permeability cracks fractures present7

originedit
granite felsic composition common recent geologic time contrast earths ultramafic ancient igneous history felsic rocks less dense mafic ultramafic rocks thus tend escape subduction whereas basaltic gabbroic rocks tend sink mantle beneath granitic rocks continental cratons therefore granitic rocks form basement land continents

ascent emplacementedit
ascent emplacement large volumes granite within upper continental crust source much debate amongst geologists lack field evidence proposed mechanisms hypotheses predominantly based upon experimental data major hypotheses ascent magma crust

stokes diapir
fracture propagation

mechanisms stokes diapir favoured many years absence reasonable alternative basic idea magma rise crust single mass buoyancy rises heats wall rocks causing behave powerlaw fluid thus flow around pluton allowing pass rapidly without major heat loss14 entirely feasible warm ductile lower crust rocks easily deformed runs problems upper crust colder brittle rocks deform easily magma rise pluton would expend much energy heating wall rocks thus cooling solidifying reaching higher levels within crust
fracture propagation mechanism preferred many geologists largely eliminates major problems moving huge mass magma cold brittle crust magma rises instead small channels along selfpropagating dykes form along preexisting fracture fault systems networks active shear zones15 narrow conduits open first magma enter solidifies provides form insulation later magma
granitic magma must make room intruded rocks order form intrusion several mechanisms proposed explain large batholiths emplaced

stoping granite cracks wall rocks pushes upwards removes blocks overlying crust
assimilation granite melts crust removes overlying material
inflation granite body inflates pressure injected position

geologists today accept combination phenomena used explain granite intrusions granites explained entirely another mechanism
