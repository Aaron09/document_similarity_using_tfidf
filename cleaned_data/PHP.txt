rasmus lerdorf wrote original common gateway interface component together andi gutmans zeev suraski rewrote parser formed


development began 1995 rasmus lerdorf wrote several common gateway interface programs c91011 used maintain personal homepage extended work forms communicate databases called implementation personal home pageforms interpreter phpfi
phpfi could used build simple dynamic applications accelerate reporting improve code lerdorf initially announced release phpfi personal home page tools tools version usenet discussion group compinfosystemswwwauthoringcgi june 19951213 release already basic functionality 2013update included perllike variables form handling ability embed html syntax resembled perl simpler limited less consistent4
early intended programming language grew organically lerdorf noting retrospect don’t know stop never intent write programming language absolutely idea write programming language kept adding next logical step way14 development team began form months work beta testing officially released phpfi november 1997
fact originally designed instead developed organically inconsistent naming functions inconsistent ordering parameters15 cases function names chosen match lowerlevel libraries wrapping16 early versions length function names used internally hash function names chosen improve distribution hash values17

zeev suraski andi gutmans rewrote parser 1997 formed base changing languages name recursive acronym hypertext preprocessor418 afterwards public testing began official launch came june 1998 suraski gutmans started rewrite phps core producing zend engine 199919 also founded zend technologies ramat israel4
2000 powered zend engine released4 august 2008 branch reached version longer development security updates released2021
5edit
july 2004 released powered zend engine included features improved support objectoriented programming data objects extension defines lightweight consistent interface accessing databases numerous performance enhancements22 2008 became stable version development late static binding missing added version 532324
many highprofile opensource projects ceased support code february 2008 gophp5 initiative25 provided consortium developers promoting transition 52627
time interpreters became available existing 32bit 64bit operating systems either building source code using prebuilt binaries28 versions available microsoft windows binary distributions 32bit builds2930 requiring windows 32bit compatibility mode using internet information services 64bit windows platform version made 64bit x8664 builds available microsoft windows31
unicodeedit
received mixed reviews lacking native unicode support core language level3233 2005 project headed andrei zmievski initiated bring native unicode support throughout embedding international components unicode library representing text strings utf16 internally34 since would cause major changes internals language user code planned release version language along major features development35
however shortage developers understood necessary changes performance problems arising conversion utf16 rarely used context delays project36 result release created 2009 many nonunicode features backported notably namespaces march 2010 project current form officially abandoned release prepared containing remaining nonunicode features traits closure rebinding37 initial hopes plan would formed unicode integration 2014 none adopted
7edit
2014 2015 major version developed numbered numbering version involved debate38 unicode experiment never released several articles book titles referenced name might caused confusion release reuse name39 vote name chosen40
foundation branch originally dubbed next generation phpng authored dmitry stogov xinchen nikita popov41 aimed optimize performance refactoring zend engine retaining nearcomplete language compatibility42 july 2014update wordpressbased benchmarks served main benchmark suite phpng project showed almost increase performance changes phpng also expected make easier improve performance future compact data structures changes seen better suited successful migration justintime compiler43 significant changes reworked zend engine called zend engine succeeding zend engine used
major internal changes phpng must receive major version number rather minor release according phps release process45 major versions allowed break backwardcompatibility code therefore presented opportunity improvements beyond phpng require backwardcompatibility breaks particular involved following changes

many fatal recoverablelevel legacy error mechanisms replaced modern objectoriented exceptions46
syntax variable dereferencing reworked internally consistent complete allowing operators arbitrary meaningful lefthandside expressions47
support legacy 4style constructor methods deprecated48
behavior foreach statement changed predictable49
constructors classes builtin returned null upon failure changed throw exception instead consistency50
several unmaintained deprecated server application programming interfaces sapis extensions removed core notably legacy mysql extension51
behavior list operator changed remove support strings52
support legacy aspstyle code delimiters script languagephp script removed53
oversight allowing switch statement multiple default clauses fixed54
support hexadecimal number support implicit conversions strings number types removed55
leftshift rightshift operators changed behave consistently across platforms56
conversions integers floating point numbers tightened implemented consistently across platforms5657

also included language features notably introduces return type declarations functions58 complement existing parameter type declarations support scalar types integer float string boolean parameter return type declarations59

echo phello worldp

html

however requirement exists code embedded html simplest version hello world written like closing omitted preferred files containing pure code87


hello world

interpreter executes code within delimiters anything outside delimiters processed although nonphp text still subject control structures described code common delimiters open close sections shortened form also exists short delimiter makes script files less portable since support disabled local configuration therefore discouraged8889 however recommendation echo short prior short syntax echo works shortopentag configuration setting enabled later always available919288 purpose delimiters separate code nonphp content javascript code html markup93
first form delimiters xhtml documents creates correctly formed processing instructions94 means resulting mixture code markup serverside file wellformed
variables prefixed dollar symbol type need specified advance introduced type hinting allows functions force parameters objects specific class arrays interfaces callback functions however type hints could used scalar types integer string59
unlike function class names variable names case sensitive doublequoted heredoc strings provide ability interpolate variables value string95 treats newlines whitespace manner freeform language statements terminated semicolon96 three types comment syntax marks block inline comments well used oneline comments97 echo statement several facilities provides output text browser
terms keywords language syntax similar style syntax conditions loops function returns similar syntax languages java perl
data typesedit
stores integers platformdependent range either 64bit 32bit signed integer equivalent clanguage long type unsigned integers converted signed values certain situations behavior different programming languages98 integer variables assigned using decimal positive negative octal hexadecimal binary notations
floating point numbers also stored platformspecific range specified using floating point notation forms scientific notation99 native boolean type similar native boolean types java using boolean type conversion rules nonzero values interpreted true zero false perl
null data type represents variable value null allowed value data type99
variables resource type represent references resources external sources typically created functions particular extension processed functions extension examples include file image database resources99
arrays contain elements type handle including resources objects even arrays order preserved lists values hashes keys values intermingled99 also supports strings used single quotes double quotes nowdoc heredoc syntax100
standard library attempts solve standard problems implements efficient data access interfaces classes101
functionsedit
defines large array functions core language many also available various extensions functions well documented online documentation102 however builtin library wide variety naming conventions associated inconsistencies described history
custom functions defined developer


function myagebirthyear defines function named myage
yearsold datey birthyear calculates
return yearsold year yearsold returns descriptive form


echo currently myage1981 outputs text concatenated
return value myage
result syntax myage called

2017 output sample program currently years
lieu function pointers functions referenced string containing name manner normal functions used example callbacks within function tables103 userdefined functions created time without prototyped102103 functions defined inside code blocks permitting runtime decision whether function defined functionexists function determines whether function given name already defined function calls must parentheses exception zeroargument class constructor functions called operator case parentheses optional
support anonymous functions closures exist createfunction exists since merely thin wrapper around eval allows normal functions created program execution104 added syntax define anonymous function closure105 capture variables surrounding scope


function getadderx
return functiony
return



adder getadder8
echo adder2 prints

example getadder function creates closure using passed argument keyword imports variable lexical context takes additional argument returns created closure caller function firstclass object meaning stored variable passed parameter functions etc106
unusually dynamically typed language supports type declarations function parameters enforced runtime supported classes interfaces since arrays since callables since scalar integer float string boolean types since 7059 also type declarations function return types expressed placing type name list parameters preceded colon58 example getadder function earlier example could annotated types like


function getadderint closure
return functionint
return



adder getadder8
echo adder2 prints
echo addernull throws exception incorrect type passed
adder getadder would also throw exception

default scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles example parameters type would allow integers also convertible numeric strings floats booleans passed function would convert them59 however strict typing mode used disallows conversions function calls returns within file59
objectsedit
basic objectoriented programming functionality added improved allowed gain abstraction making creative tasks easier programmers using language object handling completely rewritten expanding feature enhancing performance107 previous versions objects handled like value types107 drawback method code make heavy phps reference variables wanted modify object passed rather creating copy approach objects referenced handle value
introduced private protected member variables methods along abstract classes final classes abstract methods final methods also introduced standard declaring constructors destructors similar objectoriented languages standard exception handling model furthermore added interfaces allowed multiple interfaces implemented special interfaces allow objects interact runtime system objects implementing arrayaccess used array syntax objects implementing iterator iteratoraggregate used foreach language construct virtual table feature engine static variables bound name instead reference compile time108
developer creates copy object using reserved word clone zend engine check whether clone method defined call default clone copy objects properties clone method defined responsible setting necessary properties created object convenience engine supply function imports properties source object programmer start byvalue replica source object override properties need changed109
following basic example objectoriented programming


class person

public firstname
public lastname

public function constructfirstname lastname optional second argument
thisfirstname firstname
thislastname lastname


public function greet
return hello name thisfirstname
thislastname thislastname


public static function staticgreetfirstname lastname
return hello name firstname lastname



personjohn smith
personsally davis
personiamine

echo hegreet prints hello name john smith
echo

echo shegreet prints hello name sally davis
echo

echo othergreet prints hello name iamine
echo

echo personstaticgreetjane prints hello name jane

visibility properties methods defined using keywords public private protected default public used synonym public items declared public accessed everywhere protected limits access inherited classes class defines item private limits visibility class defines item110 objects type access others private protected members even though instance phps member visibility features sometimes described highly useful111 however also sometimes described best irrelevant worst positively harmful112
implementationsedit
original complete widely used implementation powered zend engine known simply disambiguate implementations sometimes unofficially referred zend zend engine compiles source code onthefly internal format execute thus works interpreter113114 also reference implementation formal specification semantics zend define semantics complex nuanced semantics defined zend works difficult competing implementations offer complete compatibility
phps singlerequestperscriptexecution model fact zend engine interpreter leads inefficiency result various products developed help improve performance order speed execution time compile source code every time page accessed scripts also deployed engines internal format using opcode cache works caching compiled form script opcodes shared memory avoid overhead parsing compiling code every time script runs opcode cache zend opcache built since version 55115 another example widely used opcode cache alternative cache available pecl extension116
zend still popular implementation several implementations developed compilers support compilation hence offer performance benefits zend expense lacking full compatibility alternative implementations include following

hiphop virtual machine hhvm developed facebook available open source converts code highlevel bytecode commonly known intermediate language translated x8664 machine code dynamically runtime justintime compiler resulting performance improvements117
parrot virtual machine designed dynamic languages efficiently pipp transforms source code parrot intermediate representation translated parrots bytecode executed virtual machine
phalanger compiles common intermediate language bytecode
hiphop developed facebook available open source transforms scripts code compiles resulting code reducing server load early 2013 facebook deprecated favor hhvm multiple reasons including deployment difficulties lack support whole language including createfunction eval constructs118

licensingedit
