thirdcentury writer censorinus says

thought necessary every years intercalary month days civil year correspond natural solar year intercalation preference made february terminalia 23rd regifugium 24th57

fifthcentury writer macrobius says romans intercalated days alternate years saturnalia 11312 intercalation placed february remaining five days february followed saturnalia 11315 avoid nones falling nundine necessary intercalary inserted middle terminalia placed intercalary month58
historically correct intercalaris began february began second february60 varro writing first century says twelfth month february intercalations take place five last days month removed61 since days ides intercalaris counted beginning march intercalaris either days making year making year
another theory says intercalary years february days intercalaris date offered regifugium 378day years62 macrobius describes refinement whereby 8year period within 24year cycle three intercalary years days refinement brings calendar back line seasons averages length year 36525 days years
pontifex maximus determined intercalary month inserted average happened alternate years system aligning year intercalary months broke least twice first time second punic reform acilian intercalation details unclear appears successfully regulated intercalation century second breakdown middle first century related increasingly chaotic adversarial nature roman politics time position pontifex maximus fulltime held member roman elite would almost invariably involved machinations roman politics term office elected roman magistrates defined terms roman calendar year pontifex maximus would reason lengthen year allies power shorten year political opponents held office
