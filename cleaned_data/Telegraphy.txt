contrary extensive definition used chappe morse argued term telegraph strictly applied systems transmit record messages distance distinguished semaphore merely transmits messages smoke signals instance considered semaphore telegraph according morse telegraph dates 1832 pavel schilling invented earliest electrical telegraphs3
telegraph message sent electrical telegraph operator telegrapher using morse code printing telegraph operator using plain text known telegram cablegram message sent submarine telegraph cable4 often shortened cable wire later telex message sent telex network switched network teleprinters similar telephone network
