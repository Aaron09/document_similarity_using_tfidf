commandline interface command language interpreter also known commandline user interface console user interface1 character user interface means interacting computer program user client issues commands program form successive lines text command lines program handles interface called command language interpreter shell
primary means interaction computer systems computer terminals mid1960s continued used throughout 1970s 1980s openvms unix systems personal computer systems including msdos apple interface usually implemented command line shell program accepts commands text input converts commands appropriate operating system functions
commandline interfaces computer operating systems less widely used casual computer users favor graphical user interfaces menudriven interaction
alternatives command line include limited text user interface menus smit example keyboard shortcuts various desktop metaphors centered pointer usually controlled mouse examples include windows versions shell runs dosshell mouse systems powerpanel
commandline interfaces often preferred advanced computer users often provide concise powerful means control program operating system
programs commandline interfaces generally easier automate scripting
command line interfaces software operating systems include number programming languages tcltk others well utilities compression utilities winzip ultimatezip sshtelnet clients

compared graphical user interface command line requires fewer system resources implement since options commands given characters command line experienced user finds options easier access automation repetitive tasks simplified operating systems using command line interface support mechanism storing frequently used sequences disk file reuse extend scripting language take parameters variable options commandline history kept allowing review repetition commands
commandline system require paper online manuals users reference although often help option provides concise review options command command line environment provide graphical enhancements different fonts extended edit windows found difficult user become familiar commands options available compared dropdown menus graphical user interface without repeated reference manuals
operating system commandline interfacesedit
operating system command line interfaces usually distinct programs supplied operating system program implements text interface often called commandline interpreter command processor shell
examples commandline interpreters include decs digital command language openvms rsx11 various unix shells tcsh bash historical msdosibmdosdrdoss commandcom well windows cmdexe programs latter groups based heavily decs rsx11 rsts clis operating systems possible replace default shell program alternatives examples include 4dos 4os2 take command windows
although term shell often used describe commandline interpreter strictly speaking shell program constitutes userinterface including fully graphically oriented ones example default windows shell program named explorerexe defined shellexplorerexe line winini configuration file programs shells clis
application commandline interfacesedit
application programs opposed operating systems also command line interfaces
application program support none three major types command line interface mechanisms

parameters operating systems support means pass additional information program launched program launched command line shell additional text provided along program name passed launched program
interactive command line sessions launch program provide operator independent means enter commands form text
interprocess communication operating systems support means interprocess communication example standard streams named pipes command lines client processes redirected program methods

applications support presenting prompt user acting upon command lines entered programs support cases simply wrapper around separate executable file cases program provide optional alternative clis guis often support different functionality example features matlab numerical analysis computer program available whereas matlab exposes subset features

general pattern command line interface78
prompt command param1 param2 param3 paramn

prompt generated program provide context client
command provided client commands usually three classes

internal recognized processed command line interpreter dependent upon external executable file
included separate executable file generally considered part operating environment always included
external external executable files part basic added parties specific purposes applications


param1 paramn optional parameters provided client format meaning parameters depends upon command issued case included external commands values parameters delivered program specified command launched parameters either arguments options

example delimiters command line elements whitespace characters endofline delimiter newline delimiter widely used universal convention commandline interfaces
generally considered consisting syntax semantics syntax grammar commands must follow case operating systems msdos unix define rules commands must follow case embedded systems vendor nortel juniper networks cisco systems defines proprietary rules commands within conform rules also dictate user navigates system commands semantics define sort operations possible sort data operations performed grammar represents operations dataâ€”the symbolic meaning syntax
different clis agree either syntax semantics agree considered sufficiently similar allow users clis without needing learn anything well enable reuse scripts
simple display prompt accept command line typed user terminated enter execute specified command provide textual display results error messages advanced clis validate interpret parameterexpand command line executing specified command optionally capture redirect output
unlike button menu item command line typically selfdocumenting stating exactly user wants done addition command lines usually include many defaults changed customize results useful command lines saved assigning character string alias represent full command several commands grouped perform complex sequence instance compile program install creating single entity called command procedure script treated command advantages mean user must figure complex command series commands saved used
commands given shell often following forms

dosomething tofiles
dosomething sourcefile destinationfile
dosomething inputfile outputfile
dosomething dosomething dosomething outputfile

dosomething effect verb adverb example command executed verbosely quietly tofiles object objects typically files command third example redirection operator telling commandline interpreter send output command standard output screen named file overwrite file using redirect output append file another redirection operator vertical creates pipeline output command becomes input next command
resource protectionedit
modify available commands modifying paths appear path environment variable unix commands also need marked executable files directories path variable searched order given reordering path os2mdoseexe instead os2eexe default opposite renaming executables also works people often rename favourite editor edit example
command line allows restrict available commands access advanced internal commands windows cmdexe often shareware programs limit range commands including printing command administrator disabled running batch files prompt
clis network routers hierarchy modes different commands supported mode commands grouped association security system interface systems user might traverse series submodes example modes called interface system user might command interface enter interface mode point commands system mode accessible user exits interface mode enters system mode
command promptedit
command prompt redirects windows component named command prompt cmdexe
command prompt prompt sequence characters used commandline interface indicate readiness accept commands literally prompts user take action prompt usually ends characters often includes information path current working directory hostname
many unix derivative systems prompt commonly ends user normal user user superuser root unix terminology
endusers often modify prompts depending environment include colors special characters elements like variables functions current time user shell number working directory order instance make prompt informative visually pleasing distinguish sessions various machines indicate current level nesting commands systems special tokens definition prompt used cause external programs called commandline interpreter displaying prompt
doss commandcom windows cmdexe users modify prompt issuing prompt command directly changing value corresponding prompt environment variable default modern systems style obtained instance prompt default older systems obtained prompt although systems produces newer style unless used floppy drives systems prompt used override automatic default explicitly switch older style
many unix systems feature variable prompt string although variables also affect prompt depending shell used bash shell prompt form

argumentsedit




command line illustrating parsing command arguments


commandline argument parameter item information provided program started program many commandline arguments identify sources destinations information alter operation program
command processor active program typically invoked typing name followed commandline arguments example unix unixlike environments example commandline argument


files

files commandline argument tells program remove file files
programming languages java allow program interpret commandline arguments handling string parameters main function languages python expose arguments global variables
unixlike operating systems single hyphenminus usually special value specifying program handle data coming standard input send data standard output
commandline optionedit
commandline option simply option also known flag switch modifies operation command effect determined commands program options follow command name command line separated spaces space first option always required example effect list commands options whereas help many versions unix require option preceded least space casesensitive
format options varies widely operating systems cases syntax convention rather operating system requirement entire command line simply string passed program process programmer wants long interpreter tell command name ends arguments options begin
representative samples commandline options relating listing files directory illustrate conventions

abbreviating commandsedit
multics commandline options subsystem keywords abbreviated idea appears derive programming language shortened keywords strg stringrange declare example multics forum subsystem longsubject parameter abbreviated lgsj also common multics commands abbreviated typically corresponding initial letters words strung together underscores form command names deleteiacldir
systems abbreviations automatic permitting enough first characters command name uniquely identify abbreviation superuser others specific abbreviations preprogrammed mkdir commandcom userdefined batch scripts aliases alias mkdir tcsh also completion
option conventions windows os2edit
windows different programs called commandcom cmdexe internal commands different syntax within operating system example

options indicated either switch characters either allowed
casesensitive
sometimes options arguments together sometimes separated whitespace sometimes character typically thus prog ffilename prog filename prog ffilename prog ffilename
programs allow singlecharacter options combined others switch mean incorrect even valid different parameter

windows forward slash prevalent although hyphenminus also sometimes used many versions msdospc higher versions drdos since well ptsdos embedded freedos rxdos switch character sometimes abbreviated switchar switchchar used defined value returned system call 21hah37h default character returned changed hyphenminus abovementioned systems except datalight romdos msdospc higher always return call unless many available tsrs reenable switchar feature loaded systems msdospc plus drdos higher ptsdos embedded freedos rxdos setting also preconfigured switchar directive configsys embedded provides switch command purpose whereas 4dos allows setting changed setdos drdos setting changed first directory separator display prompt parameter change forward slash also valid directory separator flexos 4680 4690 windows thereby serving visual clue indicate change versions drdos commandcom also support prompt token display current setting commandcom since drdos 4dos also provide pseudoenvironment variable named allow portable batchjobs written several external drdos commands additionally support environment variable switchar override system setting
however many programs hardwired rather retrieving switch setting parsing command line arguments small number mainly ports unixlike systems programmed accept even switch character example netstat ping supplied windows accept option list available options list specify convention
