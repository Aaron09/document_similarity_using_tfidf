historyedit
textual criticism practiced thousand yearscitation needed early textual critics especially librarians hellenistic alexandria last centuries concerned preserving works antiquity continued medieval period early modern times invention printing press textual criticism important aspect work many renaissance humanists desiderius erasmus edited greek testament italy scholars petrarch poggio bracciolini collected edited many latin manuscripts spirit critical enquiry boosted attention textual states example work lorenzo valla purported donation constantine
many ancient works bible greek tragediescitation needed survive hundreds copies relationship copy original unclear textual scholars debated centuries sources closely derived original hence readings sources correctcitation needed although biblical books letters like greek plays presumably original question whether biblical books like gospels ever original discussed3 interest applying textual criticism quran also developed discovery sanaa manuscripts 1972 possibly date back 7–8th centuries
english language works shakespeare particularly fertile ground textual criticism—both texts transmitted contain considerable amount variation effort expense producing superior editions works always widely viewed worthwhile4 principles textual criticism although originally developed refined works antiquity bible angloamerican copytext editing shakespeare5 applied many works nearcontemporary texts earliest known written documents ranging ancient mesopotamia egypt twentieth century textual criticism covers period five millennia
basic notions objectivesedit
basic problem described paul maas follows

autograph handwritten original author manuscripts greek roman classical writers copies collated originals manuscripts possess derive originals unknown number intermediate copies consequently questionable trustworthiness business textual criticism produce text close possible original constitutio textus6

maas comments dictation revised author must regarded equivalent autograph manuscript lack autograph manuscripts applies many cultures greek roman situation objective becomes identification first exemplar split tradition exemplar known archetype succeed establishing text archetype constitutio reconstruction original considerably advanced7
textual critics ultimate objective production critical editioncitation needed contains text author determined closely approximates original accompanied apparatus criticus critical apparatus critical apparatus presents authors work three parts first list description evidence editor used names manuscripts abbreviations called sigla second editors analysis evidence sometimes simple likelihood ratingcitation needed third record rejected variants text often order preferencecitation needed8

folio papyrus containing corinthians 1133–129


mechanical printing literature copied hand many variations introduced copyists printing made scribal profession effectively redundant printed editions less susceptible proliferation variations likely arise manual transmission nonetheless immune introducing variations authors autograph instead scribe miscopying source compositor printing shop read typeset work differs autograph9 since scribe printer commits different errors reconstruction lost original often aided selection readings taken many sources edited text draws multiple sources said eclectic contrast approach textual critics prefer identify single best surviving text combine readings multiple sources10
comparing different documents witnesses single original text observed differences called variant readings simply variants readings always apparent single variant represents authors original work process textual criticism seeks explain variant entered text either accident duplication omission intention harmonization censorship scribes supervisors transmitted original authors text copying textual critics task therefore sort variants eliminating likely unoriginal hence establishing critical text critical edition intended best approximate original time critical text document variant readings relation extant witnesses reconstructed original apparent reader critical edition establishing critical text textual critic considers external evidence provenance affiliation witness internal physical considerations author scribes printers likely done3
collation known variants text referred variorum namely work textual criticism whereby variations emendations side side reader track textual decisions made preparation text publication11 bible works william shakespeare often subjects variorum editions although techniques applied less frequency many works walt whitmans leaves grass12 prose writings edward fitzgerald13
eclecticismedit
eclecticism refers practice consulting wide diversity witnesses particular original practice based principle independent transmission histories less likely reproduce errors omits others retain adds others unlikely eclecticism allows inferences drawn regarding original text based evidence contrasts witnesses
eclectic readings also normally give impression number witnesses available reading although reading supported majority witnesses frequently preferred follow automatically example second edition shakespeare play include addition alluding event known happened editions although nearly subsequent manuscripts included addition textual critics reconstruct original without addition
result process text readings drawn many witnesses copy particular manuscript deviate majority existing manuscripts purely eclectic approach single witness theoretically favored instead critic forms opinions individual witnesses relying external internal evidence14
since mid19th century eclecticism priori bias single manuscript dominant method editing greek text testament currently united bible society nestlealand 28th even oldest manuscripts alexandrian texttype favored critical text alexandrian disposition15
external evidenceedit
external evidence evidence physical witness date source relationship known witnesses critics often prefer readings supported oldest witnesses since errors tend accumulate older manuscripts fewer errors readings supported majority witnesses also usually preferred since less likely reflect accidents individual biases reasons geographically diverse witnesses preferred manuscripts show evidence particular care taken composition example including alternative readings margins demonstrating prior copy exemplar consulted producing current factors equal best witnesses role textual critic necessary basic criteria conflict instance typically fewer early copies larger number later copies textual critic attempt balance criteria determine original text
many sophisticated considerations example readings depart known practice scribe given period deemed reliable since scribe unlikely initiative departed usual practice16
internal evidenceedit
internal evidence evidence comes text independent physical characteristics document various considerations used decide reading likely original sometimes considerations conflict16
common considerations latin names lectio brevior shorter reading lectio difficilior difficult reading first general observation scribes tended words clarification habit often removed second lectio difficilior potior harder reading stronger recognizes tendency harmonization—resolving apparent inconsistencies text applying principle leads taking difficult unharmonized reading likely original cases also include scribes simplifying smoothing texts fully understand17
another scribal tendency called homoioteleuton meaning endings homoioteleuton occurs wordsphraseslines sequence letters scribe finished copying first skips second omitting intervening words homeoarchy refers eyeskip beginnings lines similar18
critic also examine writings author decide words grammatical constructions match style evaluation internal evidence also provides critic information helps evaluate reliability individual manuscripts thus consideration internal external evidence relatedcitation needed
considering relevant factors textual critic seeks reading best explains readings would arise reading likely candidate originalcitation needed

stemmatic method assumes witness derived predecessor scribe refers source creating copy copy clearly fall single branch family tree stemmatic method manuscript derived source said contaminated
method also assumes scribes make errors—they attempt correct errors predecessors text improved scribe said sophisticated sophistication impairs method obscuring documents relationship witnesses making difficult place manuscript correctly stemma
stemmatic method requires textual critic group manuscripts commonality error required therefore critic distinguish erroneous readings correct ones assumption often come attack greg noted scribe makes mistake inevitably produce nonsense tacit wholly unwarranted assumption38

bibliographer ronald mckerrow introduced term copytext 1904 edition works thomas nashe defining text used particular case basis mine mckerrow aware limitations stemmatic method believed prudent choose particular text thought particularly reliable emend text obviously corrupt french critic joseph bédier likewise became disenchanted stemmatic method concluded editor choose best available text emend little possible
mckerrows method originally introduced copytext necessarily earliest text cases mckerrow would choose later witness noting editor reason suppose certain text embodies later corrections time ground disbelieving corrections least work author choice make text basis reprint43
1939 prolegomena oxford shakespeare mckerrow changed mind approach feared later edition—even contained authorial corrections—would deviate widely earliest print authors original manuscript therefore concluded correct procedure would produced using earliest good print copytext inserting first edition contains corrections appear derived author fearing arbitrary exercise editorial judgment mckerrow stated concluded later edition substantive revisions attributable author must accept alterations edition saving seem obvious blunders misprints44
gregs rationale copytextedit
angloamerican textual criticism last half 20th century came dominated landmark 1950 essay walter greg rationale copytext greg proposed

distinction significant shall call substantive readings text namely affect authors meaning essence expression others general spelling punctuation worddivision like affecting mainly formal presentation regarded accidents shall call accidentals text45

greg observed compositors printing shops tended follow substantive readings copy faithfully except deviated unintentionally regards accidentals normally follow habits inclination though various reasons varying degrees influenced copy46
concluded

true theory contend copytext govern generally matter accidentals choice substantive readings belongs general theory textual criticism lies altogether beyond narrow principle copytext thus happen critical edition text rightly chosen copy means supplies substantive readings cases variation failure make distinction apply principle naturally close general reliance upon text chosen basis edition arisen called tyranny copytext tyranny opinion vitiated much best editorial work past generation47

gregs view short copytext allowed overriding even preponderant authority substantive readings concerned choice reasonable competing readings said

determined partly opinion editor form respecting nature copy substantive edition printed matter external authority partly intrinsic authority several texts judged relative frequency manifest errors therein partly editors judgment intrinsic claims individual readings originality—in words intrinsic merit long merit mean likelihood author wrote rather appeal individual taste editor48

although greg argued editor free judgment choose competing substantive readings suggested editor defer copytext claims readings appear exactly balanced case logical reason giving preference copytext practice reason altering reading obvious thing seems stand49 exactly balanced variants said indifferent
editors follow gregs rationale produce eclectic editions authority accidentals derived particular source usually earliest editor considers authoritative authority substantives determined individual case according editors judgment resulting text except accidentals constructed without relying predominantly witness

william shakespeare midsummer nights dream first folio


1964 essay principles scholarly editions nineteenthcentury american authors bowers said theory copytext proposed walter greg rules supreme50 bowerss assertion supremacy contrast gregs modest claim desire rather provoke discussion law51
whereas greg limited illustrative examples english renaissance drama expertise bowers argued rationale workable editorial principle contrived produce critical text authoritative maximum details whether author shakespeare dryden fielding nathaniel hawthorne stephen crane principle sound without regard literary period52 works authors manuscript survived—a case greg considered—bowers concluded manuscript generally serve copytext citing example nathaniel hawthorne noted

authors manuscript preserved paramount authority course fallacy still maintained since first edition proofread author must represent final intentions hence chosen copytext practical experience shows contrary collates manuscript house seven gables first printed edition finds average fifteen differences page manuscript print many consistent alterations manuscript system punctuation capitalization spelling worddivision would ridiculous argue hawthorne made approximately three four thousand small changes proof wrote manuscript blithedale romance according system manuscript seven gables system rejected proof53

following greg editor would replace manuscript readings substantives printed editions could reliably attributed author obviously editor cannot simply reprint manuscript must substitute readings words believes hawthorne changed proof53
uninfluenced final authorial intentionedit
mckerrow articulated textual criticisms goal terms ideal authors fair copy work final state54 bowers asserted editions founded gregs method would represent nearest approximation every respect authors final intentions55 bowers stated similarly editors task approximate nearly possible inferential authorial fair copy56 tanselle notes textual criticism generally undertaken view reconstructing accurately possible text finally intended author57
bowers tanselle argue rejecting textual variants author inserted suggestion others bowers said edition stephen cranes first novel maggie presented authors final uninfluenced artistic intentions58 writings tanselle refers unconstrained authorial intention authors uninfluenced intentions59 marks departure greg merely suggested editor inquire whether later reading author reasonably supposed substituted former60 implying inquiry author made change
tanselle discusses example herman melvilles typee novels initial publication melvilles publisher asked soften novels criticisms missionaries south seas although melville pronounced changes improvement tanselle rejected edition concluding evidence internal external suggest kinds changes melville would made without pressure someone else61
bowers confronted similar problem edition maggie crane originally printed novel privately 1893 secure commercial publication 1896 crane agreed remove profanity also made stylistic revisions bowerss approach preserve stylistic literary changes 1896 revert 1893 readings believed crane fulfilling publishers intention rather however intermediate cases could reasonably attributed either intention bowerss choices came fire—both judgment wisdom conflating readings different versions maggie62
hans zeller argued impossible tease apart changes crane made literary reasons made publishers insistence

firstly anticipation character expected censorship crane could undertake alterations also literary value context version secondly systematic character work purely censorial alterations sparked alterations determined stage literary considerations consequence systemic character work contamination historical versions edited text gives rise third version though editor indeed give rational account decision point basis documents nevertheless produce ideal text crane would produced 1896 publisher left complete freedom mind unhistorical question first world history united states would developed germany caused enter 1917 unlimited submarine combat nonspecific form censorship described historical conditions crane wrote second version maggie made function text arose possible subtract forces influences order obtain text authors indeed regard uninfluenced artistic intentions author something exists terms aesthetic abstraction influences author influences text manner transitions63

bowers tanselle recognize texts often exist authoritative version tanselle argues

types revision must distinguished aims altering purpose direction character work thus attempting make different sort work aims intensifying refining improving work conceived whether succeeds thus altering work degree kind think work terms spatial metaphor first might labeled vertical revision moves work different plane second horizontal revision involves alterations within plane produce local changes active intention revisions first type appear fulfillment altered programmatic intention reflect altered active intention work whole whereas second not64

suggests revision horizontal aimed improving work originally conceived editor adopt authors later version revision vertical fundamentally altering works intention whole revision treated work edited separately terms
format apparatusedit
bowers also influential defining form critical apparatus accompany scholarly edition addition content apparatus bowers movement relegate editorial matter appendices leaving critically established text clear free signs editorial intervention tanselle explained rationale approach

first place editors primary responsibility establish text whether goal reconstruct form text represents authors final intention form text essential task produce reliable text according principles relegating editorial matter appendix allowing text stand serves emphasize primacy text permits reader confront literary work without distraction editorial comment read work ease second advantage clear text easier quote reprint although device insure accuracy quotation insertion symbols even footnote numbers text places additional difficulties quoter furthermore quotations appear contexts symbols inappropriate thus necessary quote text kept clear apparatus burden producing clear text passage placed quoter even footnotes bottom text pages open objection question photographic reprint arises65

critics believe cleartext edition gives edited text great prominence relegating textual variants appendices difficult suggesting greater sense certainty established text deserves shillingsburg notes english scholarly editions tended notes foot text page indicating tacitly greater modesty established text drawing attention forcibly least alternative forms text66
