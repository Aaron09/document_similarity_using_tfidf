overviewedit
systems biology considered number different aspects

field study particularly study interactions components biological systems interactions give rise function behavior system example enzymes metabolites metabolic pathway heart beats456
paradigm usually defined antithesis socalled reductionist paradigm biological organisation although fully consistent scientific method distinction paradigms referred quotations


reductionist approach successfully identified components many interactions unfortunately offers convincing concepts methods understand system properties emergethe pluralism causes effects biological networks better addressed observing quantitative measures multiple components simultaneously rigorous data integration mathematical models sauer


systems biologyis putting together rather taking apart integration rather reduction requires develop ways thinking integration rigorous reductionist programmes differentit means changing philosophy full sense term denis noble6


series operational protocols used performing research namely cycle composed theory analytic computational modelling propose specific testable hypotheses biological system experimental validation using newly acquired quantitative description cells cell processes refine computational model theory8 since objective model interactions system experimental techniques suit systems biology systemwide attempt complete possible therefore transcriptomics metabolomics proteomics highthroughput techniques used collect quantitative data construction validation models9
application dynamical systems theory molecular biology indeed focus dynamics studied systems main conceptual difference systems biology bioinformatics10
socioscientific phenomenon defined strategy pursuing integration complex data interactions biological systems diverse experimental sources using interdisciplinary tools personnel11

variety viewpoints illustrative fact systems biology refers cluster peripherally overlapping concepts rather single welldelineated field however term widespread currency popularity 2007 chairs institutes systems biology proliferating worldwide

systems biology finds roots incitation needed

quantitative modeling enzyme kinetics discipline flourished 1900 1970
mathematical modeling population dynamics
simulations developed study neurophysiology

theorists seen precursors systems biology ludwig bertalanffy general systems theory12 first numerical simulations cell biology published 1952 british neurophysiologists nobel prize winners alan lloyd hodgkin andrew fielding huxley constructed mathematical model explained action potential propagating along axon neuronal cell13 model described cellular function emerging interaction different molecular components potassium sodium channel therefore seen beginning computational systems biology14 also 1952 alan turing published chemical basis morphogenesis describing nonuniformity could arise initially homogeneous biological system15
1960 denis noble developed first computer model heart pacemaker16
formal study systems biology distinct discipline launched systems theorist mihajlo mesarovic 1966 international symposium case institute technology cleveland ohio entitled systems theory biology1718
1960s 1970s development several approaches study complex molecular systems metabolic control analysis biochemical systems theory successes molecular biology throughout 1980s coupled skepticism toward theoretical biology promised achieved caused quantitative modeling biological processes become somewhat minor field19
however birth functional genomics 1990s meant large quantities highquality data became available computing power exploded making realistic models possible 1992 1994 serial articles 2021222324 systems medicine systems genetics systems biological engineering zeng published china giving lecture biosystems theory systemsapproach research first international conference transgenic animals beijing 1996 1997 group masaru tomita published first quantitative model metabolism whole hypothetical cell25
around year 2000 institutes systems biology established seattle tokyo systems biology emerged movement right spurred completion various genome projects large increase data omics genomics proteomics accompanying advances highthroughput experiments bioinformatics
2002 national science foundation forward grand challenge systems biology 21st century build mathematical model whole cell26 2003 work massachusetts institute technology begun cytosolve method model whole cell dynamically integrating multiple molecular pathway models2728 since various research institutes dedicated systems biology developed example nigms established project grant currently supporting systems biology centers united states29 summer 2006 shortage people systems biology30 several doctoral training programs systems biology established many parts world year national science foundation forward grand challenge systems biology 21st century build mathematical model whole cell31 2012 first wholecell model mycoplasma genitalium achieved karr laboratory mount sinai school medicine york wholecell model able predict viability genitalium cells response genetic mutations32
