organ transplantation medical procedure organ removed body placed body recipient replace damaged missing organ donor recipient location organs transported donor site another location organs andor tissues transplanted within persons body called autografts transplants recently performed subjects species called allografts allografts either living cadaveric source
organs successfully transplanted include heart kidneys liver lungs pancreas intestine thymus organs like brain cannot transplanted tissues include bones tendons referred musculoskeletal grafts corneae skin heart valves nerves veins worldwide kidneys commonly transplanted organs followed liver heart corneae musculoskeletal grafts commonly transplanted tissues outnumber organ transplants tenfold
organ donors living brain dead dead circulatory death1 tissue recovered donors circulatory death well brain death hours past cessation heartbeat unlike organs tissues exception corneas preserved stored five years meaning banked transplantation raises number bioethical issues including definition death consent given organ transplanted payment organs transplantation23 ethical issues include transplantation tourism broadly socioeconomic context organ procurement transplantation occur particular problem organ trafficking4
