basic fission weapon designs


existing nuclear weapons derive explosive energy nuclear fission reactions weapons whose explosive output exclusively fission reactions commonly referred atomic bombs atom bombs abbreviated abombs long noted something misnomer energy comes nucleus atom fusion weapons
fission weapons mass fissile material enriched uranium plutonium forced supercriticality—allowing exponential growth nuclear chain reactions—either shooting piece subcritical material another method compressing using explosive lenses subcritical sphere material using chemical explosives many times original density implosion method latter approach considered sophisticated former latter approach used fissile material plutonium10
major challenge nuclear weapon designs ensure significant fraction fuel consumed weapon destroys amount energy released fission bombs range equivalent upwards 500000 tons kilotons 21×108 gj11
fission reactions generate fission products remains split atomic nuclei many fission products either highly radioactive shortlived moderately radioactive longlived serious form radioactive contamination fully contained fission products principal radioactive component nuclear fallout

basic type nuclear weapon produces large proportion energy nuclear fusion reactions fusion weapons generally referred thermonuclear weapons colloquially hydrogen bombs abbreviated hbombs rely fusion reactions isotopes hydrogen deuterium tritium weapons derive significant portion energy fission reactions used trigger fusion reactions fusion reactions trigger additional fission reactions13
countries—united states russia united kingdom china france india—have conducted thermonuclear weapon tests whether india detonated true multistaged thermonuclear weapon controversial14 north korea claims tested fusion weapon january 2016 though claim disputed15 thermonuclear weapons considered much difficult successfully design execute primitive fission weapons almost nuclear weapons deployed today thermonuclear design efficientcitation needed
thermonuclear bombs work using energy fission bomb compress heat fusion fuel tellerulam design accounts multimegaton yield hydrogen bombs accomplished placing fission bomb fusion fuel tritium deuterium lithium deuteride proximity within special radiationreflecting container fission bomb detonated gamma rays xrays emitted first compress fusion fuel heat thermonuclear temperatures ensuing fusion reaction creates enormous numbers highspeed neutrons induce fission materials normally prone depleted uranium components known stage fission bomb primary fusion capsule secondary large megatonrange hydrogen bombs half yield comes final fissioning depleted uranium11
virtually thermonuclear weapons deployed today twostage design described possible additional fusion stages—each stage igniting larger amount fusion fuel next stage technique used construct thermonuclear weapons arbitrarily large yield contrast fission bombs limited explosive force largest nuclear weapon ever detonated tsar bomba ussr released energy equivalent megatons threestage weapon thermonuclear weapons considerably smaller practical constraints missile warhead space weight requirements16

decommissioned united states peacekeeper missile icbm developed replace minuteman missile late 1980s missile like heavier lift russian ss18 satan could contain nuclear warheads shown could aimed different target factor development mirvs make complete missile defense difficult enemy country


different forms nuclear weapons delivery allow different types nuclear strategies goals strategy generally make difficult enemy launch preemptive strike weapon system difficult defend delivery weapon potential conflict mean keeping weapon locations hidden deploying submarines land mobile transporter erector launchers whose locations difficult track mean protecting weapons burying hardened missile silo bunkers components nuclear strategies included using missile defenses destroy missiles land implementing civil defense measures using earlywarning systems evacuate citizens safe areas attack
weapons designed threaten large populations deter attacks known strategic weapons nuclear weapons battlefield military situations called tactical weapons
critics nuclear strategy often suggest nuclear nations would result mutual annihilation point view significance nuclear weapons deter nuclear would escalate mutual distrust fear resulting mutually assured destruction threat national global destruction strong motivation antinuclear weapons activism
critics peace movement within military establishmentcitation needed questioned usefulness weapons current military climate according advisory opinion issued international court justice 1996 threat weapons would generally contrary rules international applicable armed conflict court reach opinion whether threat would lawful specific extreme circumstances survival state stake
another deterrence position nuclear proliferation desirable case argued unlike conventional weapons nuclear weapons deter allout states succeeded cold soviet union26 late 1950s early 1960s pierre marie gallois france adviser charles gaulle argued books like balance terror strategy nuclear 1961 mere possession nuclear arsenal enough ensure deterrence thus concluded spread nuclear weapons could increase international stability prominent neorealist scholars kenneth waltz john mearsheimer argued along lines gallois forms nuclear proliferation would decrease likelihood total especially troubled regions world exists single nuclearweapon state aside public opinion opposes proliferation form schools thought matter like mearsheimer favored selective proliferation27 waltz somewhat noninterventionist2829 interest proliferation stabilityinstability paradox generates continues ongoing debate indigenous japanese south korean nuclear deterrent north korea30
threat potentially suicidal terrorists possessing nuclear weapons form nuclear terrorism complicates decision process prospect mutually assured destruction might deter enemy expects confrontation initial stateless terrorist instead sovereign nation might nation specific target retaliate argued especially september 2001 attacks complication calls nuclear strategy distinct gave relative stability cold war31 since 1996 united states policy allowing targeting nuclear weapons terrorists armed weapons mass destruction32
robert gallucci argues although traditional deterrence effective approach toward terrorist groups bent causing nuclear catastrophe gallucci believes united states instead consider policy expanded deterrence focuses solely wouldbe nuclear terrorists states deliberately transfer inadvertently lead nuclear weapons materials threatening retaliation states united states able deter cannot physically prevent33
graham allison makes similar case arguing expanded deterrence coming ways tracing nuclear material country forged fissile material nuclear bomb detonates nuclear forensics cops would collect debris samples send laboratory radiological analysis identifying unique attributes fissile material including impurities contaminants could trace path back origin34 process analogous identifying criminal fingerprints goal would twofold first deter leaders nuclear states selling weapons terrorists holding accountable weapons second give leaders every incentive tightly secure nuclear weapons materials34
