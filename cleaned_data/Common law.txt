nomination oliver wendell holmes serve supreme court 1902


oliver wendell holmes cautioned proper derivation general principles common constitutional arise gradually emergence consensus multitude particularized prior decisions45 justice cardozo noted common work preestablished truths universal inflexible validity conclusions derived deductively method inductive draws generalizations particulars46
common malleable statutory first common courts absolutely bound precedent extraordinarily good reason shown reinterpret revise without legislative intervention adapt trends political legal social philosophy second common evolves series gradual steps gradually works details decade change substantially without sharp break thereby reducing disruptive effects47 contrast common incrementalism legislative process difficult started legislatures tend delay action situation totally intolerable reasons legislative changes tend large jarring disruptive sometimes positively sometimes negatively sometimes unintended consequences
example gradual change typifies evolution common gradual change liability negligence traditional common rule 19th century plaintiff could recover defendants negligent production distribution harmful instrumentality unless privity contract thus immediate purchaser could recover product defect part built parts parts manufacturers ultimate buyer could recover injury caused defect part 1842 english case winterbottom wright48 postal service contracted wright maintain coaches winterbottom driver post coach failed injured winterbottom sued wright winterbottom court recognized would absurd outrageous consequences injured person could person peripherally involved knew draw line somewhere limit causal connection negligent conduct injury court looked contractual relationships held liability would flow person immediate contract privity negligent party
first exception rule arose 1852 case thomas winchester49 yorks highest court held mislabeling poison innocuous herb selling mislabeled poison dealer would expected resell human life imminent danger thomas relied reason create exception privity rule 1909 york held statler co50 coffee manufacturer liable person injured exploded character inherently applied purposes designed liable become source great danger many people carefully properly constructed
privity rule survived cadillac motor johnson51 decided 1915 federal appeals court york several neighboring states court held owner could recover injuries defective wheel automobile owner contract automobile dealer manufacturer even though question wheel made dead ‘dozy‘ wood quite insufficient purposes cadillac court willing acknowledge case supported exceptions article dangerous nature likely become course ordinary usage contemplated vendor however held cadillac court manufactures articles dangerous defectively made installed tables chairs pictures mirrors hung walls carriages automobiles liable third parties injuries caused except case willful injury fraud




nomination benjamin cardozo serve supreme court 1932


finally famous case macpherson buick motor co52 1916 judge benjamin cardozo yorks highest court pulled broader principle predecessor cases facts almost identical cadillac year earlier wheel wheel manufacturer sold buick dealer macpherson wheel failed injuring macpherson judge cardozo held

statler extended rule thomas winchester court committed extension defendant argues things imminently dangerous life poisons explosives deadly weapons—things whose normal function injure destroy whatever rule thomas winchester longer restricted meaning scaffold devlin smith supra inherently destructive instrument becomes destructive imperfectly constructed large coffee statler supra within negligently made potency danger thinks implement whose normal function destruction true coffee equally true bottles aerated water torgeson schultz mentioned cases court rule received like extension courts intermediate appeal burke ireland opinion cullen applied builder constructed defective building kahner otis elevator manufacturer elevator davies pelham elevating affirmed court without opinion contractor furnished defective rope knowledge purpose rope used required time either approve disapprove application rule made cases enough help characterize trend judicial thought

example states criminal statutes primarily codification preexisting common codification process enacting statute collects restates preexisting single document—when preexisting common common remains relevant interpretation statutes reliance assumption modern statutes often leave number terms fine distinctions unstated—for example statute might brief leaving precise definition terms unstated assumption fine distinctions inherited preexisting common reason many modern american schools teach common crime stood england 1789 centuriesold english common necessary foundation interpreting modern criminal statutes
transition english common crimes legal system constitution prohibited post facto laws federal state level question raised whether could common crimes united states settled case united states hudson58 decided federal courts jurisdiction define common crimes must always constitutional statute defining offense penalty
still many states retain selected common crimes example virginia definition conduct constitutes crime robbery exists common robbery statute sets punishment59 virginia code section 1200 establishes continued existence vitality common principles provides common england insofar repugnant principles bill rights constitution commonwealth shall continue full force within rule decision except altered general assembly
contrast statutory codification common statutes displace common example create cause action exist common legislatively overrule common example tort wrongful death allows certain persons usually spouse child estate damages behalf deceased tort english common thus jurisdiction lacks wrongful death statute allow lawsuit wrongful death loved wrongful death statute exists compensation remedy available limited remedy specified statute typically upper limit amount damages courts generally interpret statutes create causes action narrowly—that limited precise terms—because courts generally recognize legislature supreme deciding reach judgemade unless statute violate second order constitutional provision judicial activism
tort rooted common traditionally recognized damages tort sued whether mention damages current statutory instance person sustains bodily injury negligence another medical costs pain suffering loss earnings earning capacity mental andor emotional distress loss quality life disfigurement damages need forth statute already exist tradition common however without wrongful death statute extinguished upon death

overruling precedent—the limits stare decisisedit
united states federal courts divided twelve regional circuits circuit court appeals plus thirteenth court appeals federal circuit hears appeals patent cases cases federal government without geographic limitation decisions circuit court binding district courts within circuit circuit court persuasive authority sister circuits district court decisions binding precedent persuasive
federal courts appeal adopted rule event conflict decisions panels courts appeal almost always panels three earlier panel decision controlling panel decision overruled court appeals sitting banc active judges court higher court60 courts older decision remains controlling issue comes third time
courts example court customs patent appeals supreme court always banc thus later decision controls courts essentially overrule previous cases case older cases survive extent conflict newer cases interpretations courts—for example supreme court interpretations constitution federal statutes—are stable long older interpretation maintains support majority court older decisions persist combination belief decision right sufficiently wrong overruled

common foundation commercial economiesedit
reliance judicial opinion strength common systems significant contributor robust commercial systems united kingdom united states reasonably precise guidance almost every issue parties especially commercial parties predict whether proposed course action likely lawful unlawful assurance consistency justice brandeis famously expressed matters important applicable rule settled settled right62 ability predict gives freedom come close boundaries law63 example many commercial contracts economically efficient create greater wealth parties know ahead time proposed arrangement though perhaps close line almost certainly legal newspapers taxpayerfunded entities religious affiliation political parties obtain fairly clear guidance boundaries within freedom expression rights apply
contrast jurisdictions weak respect precedent64 fine questions redetermined anew time arise making consistency prediction difficult procedures protracted necessary parties cannot rely written statements reliable guides jurisdictions strong allegiance large body precedent parties less priori guidance unless written clear kept updated must often leave bigger safety margin unexploited opportunities final determinations reached larger expenditures legal fees parties
reason65 frequent choice state york commercial contracts even neither entity extensive contacts york—and remarkably often even neither party contacts united states65 commercial contracts almost always include choice clause reduce uncertainty somewhat surprisingly contracts throughout world example contracts involving parties japan france germany states united states often choose york even relationship parties transaction york quite attenuated history united states commercial center york common depth predictability available jurisdictions united states similarly american corporations often formed delaware corporate american contracts relating corporate issues merger acquisitions companies rights shareholders include delaware choice clause deep body delaware issues66 hand jurisdictions sufficiently developed bodies parties real motivation choose foreign jurisdiction example england wales state california fully developed parties relationship jurisdiction choose law67 outside united states parties different jurisdictions often choose england wales particularly parties former british colonies members commonwealth common theme cases commercial parties seek predictability simplicity contractual relations frequently choose common jurisdiction welldeveloped body common achieve result
likewise litigation commercial disputes arising unpredictable torts opposed prospective choice clauses contracts discussed previous paragraph certain jurisdictions attract unusually high fraction cases predictability afforded depth decided cases example london considered preeminent centre litigation admiralty cases68
