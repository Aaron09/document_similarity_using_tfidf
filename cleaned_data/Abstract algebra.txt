historyedit
parts mathematics concrete problems examples played important roles development abstract algebra nineteenth century many perhaps problems related theory algebraic equations major themes include

solving systems linear equations linear algebra
attempts find formulae solutions general polynomial equations higher degree resulted discovery groups abstract manifestations symmetry
arithmetical investigations quadratic higher degree forms diophantine equations directly produced notions ring ideal

numerous textbooks abstract algebra start axiomatic definitions various algebraic structures proceed establish properties creates false impression algebra axioms come first served motivation basis study true order historical development almost exactly opposite example hypercomplex numbers nineteenth century kinematic physical motivations challenged comprehension theories recognized parts algebra started collections disparate facts various branches mathematics acquired common theme served core around various results grouped finally became unified basis common concepts archetypical example progressive synthesis seen history group theory
early group theoryedit
several threads early development group theory modern language loosely corresponding number theory theory equations geometry
leonhard euler considered algebraic operations numbers modulo integer modular arithmetic generalization fermats little theorem investigations taken much carl friedrich gauss considered structure multiplicative groups residues established many properties cyclic general abelian groups arise investigations composition binary quadratic forms gauss explicitly stated associative composition forms like euler seems interested concrete results general theory 1870 leopold kronecker gave definition abelian group context ideal class groups number field generalizing gausss work appears definition previous work groups particularly permutation groups 1882 considering question heinrich weber realized connection gave similar definition involved cancellation property omitted existence inverse element sufficient context finite groups
permutations studied josephlouis lagrange 1770 paper réflexions résolution algébrique équations thoughts algebraic solution equations devoted solutions algebraic equations introduced lagrange resolvents lagranges goal understand equations third fourth degree admit formulae solutions identified objects permutations roots important novel step taken lagrange paper abstract view roots symbols numbers however consider composition permutations serendipitously first edition edward warings meditationes algebraicae meditations algebra appeared year expanded version published 1782 waring proved main theorem symmetric functions specially considered relation roots quartic equation resolvent cubic mémoire résolution équations memoire solving equations alexandre vandermonde 1771 developed theory symmetric functions slightly different angle like lagrange goal understanding solvability algebraic equations

kronecker claimed 1888 study modern algebra began first paper vandermonde cauchy states quite clearly vandermonde priority lagrange remarkable idea eventually study group theory1

paolo ruffini first person develop theory permutation groups like predecessors also context solving algebraic equations goal establish impossibility algebraic solution general algebraic equation degree greater four route goal introduced notion order element group conjugacy cycle decomposition elements permutation groups notions primitive imprimitive proved important theorems relating concepts

subgroup whose order divisible contains element order

note however without formalizing concept group even permutation group next step taken évariste galois 1832 although work remained unpublished 1846 considered first time called closure property group permutations expressed

group substitutions substitution

theory permutation groups received farreaching development hands augustin cauchy camille jordan introduction concepts primarily great wealth results special classes permutation groups even general theorems among things jordan defined notion isomorphism still context permutation groups incidentally term group wide
abstract notion group appeared first time arthur cayleys papers 1854 cayley realized group need permutation group even finite instead consist matrices whose algebraic properties multiplication inverses systematically investigated succeeding years much later cayley would revisit question whether abstract groups general permutation groups establish fact group isomorphic group permutations

19th beginning 20th century tremendous shift methodology mathematics abstract algebra emerged around start 20th century name modern algebra study part drive intellectual rigor mathematics initially assumptions classical algebra whole mathematics major parts natural sciences depend took form axiomatic systems longer satisfied establishing properties concrete objects mathematicians started turn attention general theory formal definitions certain algebraic structures began emerge 19th century example results various groups permutations came seen instances general theorems concern general notion abstract group questions structure classification various mathematical objects came forefront
