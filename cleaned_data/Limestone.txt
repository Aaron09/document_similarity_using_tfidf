like sedimentary rocks limestone composed grains grains limestone skeletal fragments marine organisms coral foraminifera organisms secrete shells made aragonite calcite leave shells behind carbonate grains comprising limestones ooids peloids intraclasts extraclasts
limestone often contains variable amounts silica form chert chalcedony flint jasper siliceous skeletal fragment sponge spicules diatoms radiolarians varying amounts clay silt sand terrestrial detritus carried rivers
limestones consist grains formed completely chemical precipitation calcite aragonite travertine secondary calcite deposited supersaturated meteoric waters groundwater precipitates material caves produces speleothems stalagmites stalactites another form taken calcite oolitic limestone recognized granular oolite appearance
primary source calcite limestone commonly marine organisms organisms construct mounds rock known reefs building upon past generations 3000 meters water pressure temperature conditions cause dissolution calcite increase nonlinearly limestone typically form deeper waters lysocline limestones also form lacustrine2 evaporite depositional environments34
calcite dissolved precipitated groundwater depending several factors including water temperature dissolved concentrations calcite exhibits unusual characteristic called retrograde solubility becomes less soluble water temperature increases
impurities clay sand organic remains iron oxide materials cause limestones exhibit different colors especially weathered surfaces
limestone crystalline clastic granular massive depending method formation crystals calcite quartz dolomite barite line small cavities rock conditions right precipitation calcite forms mineral coatings cement existing rock grains together fill fractures
travertine banded compact variety limestone formed along streams particularly waterfalls around cold springs calcium carbonate deposited evaporation water leaves solution supersaturated chemical constituents calcite tufa porous cellular variety travertine found near waterfalls coquina poorly consolidated limestone composed pieces coral shells
regional metamorphism occurs mountain building process orogeny limestone recrystallizes marble
limestone parent material mollisol soil group
classification

major classification schemes folk dunham used identifying limestone carbonate rocks
folk classification
main article folk classification
robert folk developed classification system places primary emphasis detailed composition grains interstitial material carbonate rocks based composition three main components allochems grains matrix mostly micrite cement sparite folk system uses twopart names first refers grains second root helpful petrographic microscope using folk scheme easier determine components present sample5
dunham classification
main article dunham classification
dunham scheme focuses depositional textures name based upon texture grains make limestone robert dunham published system limestone 1962 focuses depositional fabric carbonate rocks dunham divides rocks four main groups based relative proportions coarser clastic particles dunham names essentially rock families efforts deal question whether grains originally mutual contact therefore selfsupporting whether rock characterized presence frame builders algal mats unlike folk scheme dunham deals original porosity rock dunham scheme useful hand samples based texture grains sample6
limestone landscape

sedimentary rocks limestones78
limestone partially soluble especially acid therefore forms many erosional landforms include limestone pavements holes cenotes caves gorges erosion landscapes known karsts limestone less resistant igneous rocks resistant sedimentary rocks therefore usually associated hills downland occurs regions sedimentary rocks typically clays
karst topography caves develop limestone rocks solubility dilute acidic groundwater solubility limestone water weak acid solutions leads karst landscapes regions overlying limestone bedrock tend fewer visible aboveground sources ponds streams surface water easily drains downward joints limestone draining water organic acid soil slowly thousands millions years enlarges cracks dissolving calcium carbonate carrying away solution cave systems limestone bedrock cooling groundwater mixing different groundwaters also create conditions suitable cave formation
coastal limestones often eroded organisms bore rock various means process known bioerosion common tropics known throughout fossil record taylor wilson 2003
bands limestone emerge earths surface often spectacular rocky outcrops islands examples include burren clare ireland verdon gorge france malham cove north yorkshire isle wight9 england great orme wales fårö near swedish island gotland niagara escarpment canadaunited states notch peak utah long national park vietnam hills around lijiang river guilin city china

limestone popular late 19th early 20th centuries train stations banks structures normally made limestone used facade skyscrapers thin plates covering rather solid blocks united states indiana notably bloomington area long source high quality quarried limestone called indiana limestone many famous buildings london built portland limestone
limestone also popular building block middle ages areas occurred since hard durable commonly occurs easily accessible surface exposures many medieval churches castles europe made limestone beer stone popular kind limestone medieval buildings southern england
limestone lesser extent marble reactive acid solutions making acid rain significant problem preservation artifacts made stone many limestone statues building surfaces suffered severe damage acid rain likewise limestone gravel used protect lakes vulnerable acid rain acting buffering agent acidbased cleaning chemicals also etch limestone cleaned neutral mild alkalinebased cleaner
