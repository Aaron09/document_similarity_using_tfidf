part arab–israeli conflict ongoing dispute included many battles wars since 1948 state israel formed sixday 1967 israel captured egypts sinai peninsula roughly half syrias golan heights territories west bank held jordan since 1948

addition egyptian response included statement lasting peace could achieved without withdrawal israeli armed forces territories occupied since june 1967 golda meir reacted overture forming committee examine proposal possible concessions committee unanimously concluded israels interests would served full withdrawal internationally recognized lines dividing israel egypt syria returning gaza strip majority view returning west bank east jerusalem meir angered shelved document71 united states infuriated cool israeli response egypts proposal joseph sisco informed yitzhak rabin israel would regarded responsible rejecting best opportunity reach peace since establishment state israel responded jarrings plan also february outlining readiness make form withdrawal declaring intention returning pre5 june 1967 lines jarring disappointed blamed israel refusing accept complete pullout sinai peninsula72
sadat hoped inflicting even limited defeat israelis status could altered hafez alassad leader syria different view little interest negotiation felt retaking golan heights would purely military option sixday assad launched massive military buildup hoped make syria dominant military power arab states egypt assad felt army could convincingly israel thus secure syrias role region assad negotiations beginning golan heights retaken force would induce israel give west bank gaza make concessions
sadat also important domestic concerns wanting three years since sadat taken office demoralized egyptian history desiccated economy added nations despondency desperate option73 biography sadat raphael israeli argued sadat felt root problem great shame sixday reforms could introduced believed shame overcome egypts economy shambles sadat knew deep reforms felt needed would deeply unpopular among parts population military victory would give popularity needed make changes portion egyptian population prominently university students launched wide protests strongly desired reclaim sinai highly upset sadat launched first three years office
arab states showed much reluctance fully commit jordanian king hussein feared another major loss territory occurred sixday jordan lost west bank territory conquered annexed 1948–49 doubled population sadat also backed claim palestine liberation organization west bank gaza event victory promised yasser arafat would given control hussein still west bank part jordan wanted restored kingdom moreover black september crisis 1970 near civil broken jordanian government syria intervened militarily side estranging hussein

nassers policy following 1967 defeat conflicted soviet union soviets sought avoid conflagration arabs israelis drawn confrontation united states reality situation became apparent superpowers oslo agreed maintain status unacceptable egyptian leaders discovered egyptian preparations crossing canal leaked became imperative expel soviets egypt july 1972 sadat expelled almost 20000 soviet military advisers country reoriented countrys foreign policy favourable united states syrians remained close soviet union
soviets thought little sadats chances warned attempt cross heavily fortified suez canal would incur massive losses soviets americans pursuing détente interest seeing middle east destabilized june 1973 meeting american president richard nixon soviet leader leonid brezhnev proposed israel pull back 1967 border brezhnev said israel difficulty keeping military situation flaring up—an indication soviet union unable restrain sadats plans77

leadup surprise attack
israel defense forces directorate military intelligences abbreviated aman research department responsible formulating israels intelligence estimate assessments likelihood based several assumptions first assumed correctly syria would israel unless egypt well second department learned ashraf marwan former president nassers soninlaw also senior mossad agent79 egypt wanted regain sinai would supplied mig23 fighterbombers neutralize israeli force scud missiles used israeli cities deterrent israeli attacks egyptian infrastructure
since received mig23s scud missiles arrived egypt bulgaria late august would take four months train egyptian ground crews aman predicted egypt imminent assumption egypts strategic plans known concept strongly prejudiced departments thinking dismiss warnings
mid1973 aman almost completely aware arab plans knew egyptian second third armies would attempt cross suez canal advance kilometres sinai followed armored divisions would advance towards mitla gidi passes naval units paratroopers would attempt capture sharm elsheikh aman also aware many details syrian plan however israeli analysts following concept believe arabs serious going war80
egyptians much misconception israelis americans felt expulsion soviet military observers severely reduced effectiveness egyptian army egyptians ensured continual stream false information regarding maintenance problems lack personnel operate advanced equipment egyptians made repeated misleading reports lack spare parts made israelis sadat long engaged brinkmanship frequent threats ignored world
april 1973 israeli intelligence began picking clear signals egypts intentions recognizing necessary divisions bridging equipment cross suez canal missile umbrella protect crossing operation attack however aman chief zeira still confident probability low80
august 1973 egyptian army conducted military exercises near border ashraf marwan inaccurately warned egypt syria would launch surprise attack israeli army mobilized response exercises considerable cost exercises ensure israelis would dismiss actual preparations right attack launched another exercise
egyptian syrian military exercises
week leading kippur egyptian army staged weeklong training exercise adjacent suez canal israeli intelligence detecting large troop movements towards canal dismissed mere training exercises movements syrian troops towards border also detected cancellation leaves callup reserves syrian army activities considered puzzling threat aman believed would attack without egypt egypt would attack weaponry wanted arrived despite belief israel sent reinforcements golan heights forces prove critical early days

despite refusing participate king hussein jordan sadat assad alexandria weeks given mutual suspicions prevailing among arab leaders unlikely told specific plans probable sadat assad raised prospect israel general terms feel likelihood jordan joining in84
night september hussein secretly flew aviv warn israeli prime minister golda meir impending syrian attack going without egyptians asked meir king said didnt think think egypt would cooperate85 warning ignored aman concluded king told anything already known throughout september israel received eleven warnings wellplaced sources however mossad directorgeneral zamir continued insist arab option even husseins warning86 zamir would later remark simply didnt feel capable war86
general ariel sharon shown aerial photographs intelligence yehoshua saguy divisional intelligence officer general sharon noticed concentration egyptian forces along canal beyond anything observed training exercises egyptians amassed crossing equipment along canal called general shmuel gonen replaced head southern command expressed certainty imminent87
