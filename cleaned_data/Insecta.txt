evolutionary relationship insects animal groups remains unclear
although traditionally grouped millipedes centipedes—possibly basis convergent adaptations terrestrialisation17—evidence emerged favoring closer evolutionary ties crustaceans pancrustacea theory insects together entognatha remipedia cephalocarida make natural clade labeled miracrustacea18
report november 2014 unambiguously places insects clade crustaceans myriapods nearest sister clades19 study resolved insect phylogeny extant insect orders provides robust phylogenetic backbone tree reliable time estimates insect evolution19
terrestrial arthropods centipedes millipedes scorpions spiders sometimes confused insects since body plans appear similar sharing arthropods jointed exoskeleton however upon closer examination features differ significantly noticeably sixlegged characteristic adult insects20
higherlevel phylogeny arthropods continues matter debate research 2008 researchers tufts university uncovered believe worlds oldest known fullbody impression primitive flying insect 300millionyearold specimen carboniferous period21 oldest definitive insect fossil devonian rhyniognatha hirsti 396millionyearold rhynie chert superficially resembled modernday silverfish insect species already possessed dicondylic mandibles articulations mandible feature associated winged insects suggesting wings already evolved time thus first insects probably appeared earlier silurian period122
four super radiations insects occurred beetles evolved million years flies evolved million years moths wasps evolved million years ago23 four groups account majority described species flies moths along fleas evolved mecoptera
origins insect flight remain obscure since earliest winged insects currently known appear capable fliers extinct insects additional pair winglets attaching first segment thorax total three pairs 2009 evidence suggests insects particularly successful group animals evolved wings24
late carboniferous early permian insect orders include extant groups stem groups25 number paleozoic groups extinct giant dragonflylike forms reached wingspans making larger living insect gigantism higher atmospheric oxygen levels allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative today lack flying vertebrates could another factor extinct orders insects developed permian period began around million years many early groups became extinct permiantriassic extinction event largest mass extinction history earth around million years ago26
remarkably successful hymenoptera appeared long million years cretaceous period achieved wide diversity recently cenozoic began million years number highly successful insect groups evolved conjunction flowering plants powerful illustration coevolution27
many modern insect genera developed cenozoic insects period often found preserved amber often perfect condition body plan morphology specimens thus easily compared modern species study fossilized insects called paleoentomology

insects mostly soft bodied fragile almost defenseless compared larger lifeforms immature stages small move slowly immobile stages exposed predation parasitism insects variety defense strategies avoid attacked predators parasitoids include camouflage mimicry toxicity active defense111
camouflage important defense strategy involves coloration shape blend surrounding environment112 sort protective coloration common widespread among beetle families especially feed wood vegetation many leaf beetles family chrysomelidae weevils species sculpturing various colored scales hairs cause beetle resemble bird dung inedible objects many live sandy environments blend coloration substrate111 phasmids known effectively replicating forms sticks leaves bodies species macklotti palophus centaurus covered mossy lichenous outgrowths supplement disguise species ability change color surroundings shift scabrinota californica behavioral adaptation supplement crypsis number species noted perform rocking motion body swayed side side thought reflect movement leaves twigs swaying breeze another method stick insects avoid predation resemble twigs feigning death catalepsy insect enters motionless state maintained long period nocturnal feeding habits adults also aids phasmatodea remaining concealed predators113
another defense often uses color shape deceive potential enemies mimicry number longhorn beetles family cerambycidae bear striking resemblance wasps helps avoid predation even though beetles fact harmless111 batesian müllerian mimicry complexes commonly found lepidoptera genetic polymorphism natural selection give rise otherwise edible species mimic gaining survival advantage resembling inedible species model mimicry complex referred batesian commonly known mimicry limenitidine viceroy butterfly inedible danaine monarch later research discovered viceroy fact toxic monarch resemblance considered case müllerian mimicry110 müllerian mimicry inedible species usually within taxonomic order find advantageous resemble reduce sampling rate predators need learn insects inedibility taxa toxic genus heliconius form well known müllerian complexes114
chemical defense another important defense found among species coleoptera lepidoptera usually advertised bright colors monarch butterfly obtain toxicity sequestering chemicals plants tissues lepidoptera manufacture toxins predators poisonous butterflies moths become sick vomit violently learning types species actually basis müllerian mimicry predator previously eaten poisonous lepidopteran avoid species similar markings future thus saving many species well115 ground beetles carabidae family spray chemicals abdomen great accuracy repel predators111

pollination process pollen transferred reproduction plants thereby enabling fertilisation sexual reproduction flowering plants require animal transportation animals included pollinators majority pollination done insects116 insects usually receive benefit pollination form energy rich nectar grand example mutualism various flower traits combinations thereof differentially attract type pollinator another known pollination syndromes arose complex plantanimal adaptations pollinators find flowers bright colorations including ultraviolet attractant pheromones study pollination insects known anthecology

although pest insects attract attention many insects beneficial environment humans insects like wasps bees butterflies ants pollinate flowering plants pollination mutualistic relationship plants insects insects gather nectar different plants species also spread pollen plants previously greatly increases plants ability crosspollinate maintains possibly even improves evolutionary fitness ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops critical agriculture well pollination ants help seed distribution plants helps spread plants increases plant diversity leads overall better environment121 serious environmental problem decline populations pollinator insects number species insects cultured primarily pollination management order sufficient pollinators field orchard greenhouse bloom time122240–243 another solution shown delaware raise native plants help support native pollinators like vierecki123 insects also produce useful substances honey lacquer silk honey bees cultured humans thousands years honey although contracting crop pollination becoming significant beekeepers silkworm greatly affected human history silkdriven trade established relationships china rest world
insectivorous insects insects feed insects beneficial humans insects could cause damage agriculture human structures example aphids feed crops cause problems farmers ladybugs feed aphids used means significantly reduce pest aphid populations birds perhaps visible predators insects insects account vast majority insect consumption ants also help control animal populations consuming small vertebrates124 without predators keep check insects undergo almost unstoppable population explosions31328–34831400125126
insects also used medicine example larvae maggots formerly used treat wounds prevent stop gangrene would consume dead flesh treatment finding modern usage hospitals recently insects also gained attention potential sources drugs medicinal substances127 adult insects crickets insect larvae various kinds also commonly used fishing bait128
