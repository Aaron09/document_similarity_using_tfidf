relations rotation axis plane orbit axial tilt earth


mathematically rotation rigid body movement unlike translation keeps point fixed definition applies rotations within three dimensions plane space respectively
rigid body movements rotations translations combinations
rotation simply progressive radial orientation common point common point lies within axis motion axis degrees perpendicular plane motion axis rotation lies external body question body said orbit fundamental difference “rotation” “orbit” spin distinction simply axis rotation lies either within outside body question distinction demonstrated “rigid” “non rigid” bodies
rotation around point axis followed second rotation around pointaxis third rotation results reverse inverse rotation also rotation thus rotations around pointaxis form group however rotation around point axis rotation around different pointaxis result something rotation translation
rotations around axes called principal rotations rotation around axis performed taking rotation around axis followed rotation around axis followed rotation around axis spatial rotation decomposed combination principal rotations
flight dynamics principal rotations known pitch roll known tait–bryan angles terminology also used computer graphics

star trails caused earths rotation cameras long exposure time1


astronomy rotation commonly observed phenomenon stars planets similar bodies spin around axes rotation rate planets solar system first measured tracking visual features stellar rotation measured doppler shift tracking active surface features
rotation induces centrifugal acceleration reference frame earth slightly counteracts effect gravity closer equator effect object weighs slightly less equator another earth slightly deformed oblate spheroid
another consequence rotation planet phenomenon precession like gyroscope overall effect slight wobble movement axis planet currently tilt earths axis orbital plane obliquity ecliptic 2344 degrees angle changes slowly thousands years also precession equinoxes pole star
rotation revolutionedit
main article orbital revolution
revolution often used synonym rotation many fields particularly astronomy related fields revolution often referred orbital revolution clarity used body moves around another rotation used mean movement around axis moons revolve around planet planets revolve star earth around stars slowly revolve galaxial center motion components galaxies complex usually includes rotation component
retrograde rotationedit
main article retrograde motion
planets solar system including earth spin direction orbit exceptions venus uranus uranus rotates nearly side relative orbit current speculation uranus started typical prograde orientation knocked side large impact early history venus thought rotating slowly backwards upside dwarf planet pluto formerly considered planet anomalous ways

angular velocity vector axial vector also describes direction axis rotation similarly torque axial vector
physics rotation around fixed axis mathematically described axis–angle representation rotations according righthand rule direction away observer associated clockwise rotation direction towards observer counterclockwise rotation like screw
cosmological principleedit
laws physics currently believed invariant fixed rotation although appear change viewed rotating viewpoint rotating frame reference
modern physical cosmology cosmological principle notion distribution matter universe homogeneous isotropic viewed large enough scale since forces expected uniformly throughout universe preferred direction therefore produce observable irregularities large scale structuring course evolution matter field initially laid bang
particular system behaves regardless oriented space lagrangian rotationally invariant according noethers theorem action integral time lagrangian physical system invariant rotation angular momentum conserved

euler rotations earth intrinsic green precession blue nutation


euler rotations provide alternative description rotation composition three rotations defined movement obtained changing euler angles leaving constant euler rotations never expressed terms external frame terms comoving rotated body frame mixture constitute mixed axes rotation system first angle moves line nodes around external axis second rotates around line nodes third intrinsic rotation around axis fixed body moves

principal axes rotation space


flight dynamics principal rotations described euler angles known pitch roll term rotation also used aviation refer upward pitch nose moves aircraft particularly starting climb takeoff
principal rotations advantage modelling number physical systems gimbals joysticks easily visualised compact storing rotation difficult calculations even simple operations like combining rotations expensive suffer form gimbal lock angles cannot uniquely calculated certain rotations
amusement ridesedit
many amusement rides provide rotation ferris wheel horizontal central axis parallel axes gondola rotation opposite gravity mechanically result time orientation gondola upright rotated translated translation vector describes circle carousel provides rotation vertical axis many rides provide combination rotations several axes chairoplanes rotation vertical axis provided mechanically rotation horizontal axis centripetal force roller coaster inversions rotation horizontal axis full cycles inertia keeps people seats
