history useedit
1970s many cameras accessory shoe cold shoe intended hold flashes connected electronically outboard cable accessories external light meters special viewfinders rangefinders leica earlier accessory shoes mostly shape thus provided template introduction shoe required electrical connections made using external cables connectors connector
canon nikon olympus pentax standard shoe various proprietary electronic extensions
2014 camera accessory manufacturer cactus combined electronic extensions multibrand shoe wireless flash transceiver multibrand shoe cameras flashes different camera makers could work crossbrand
since 1988 minolta switched 4pin proprietary slideon autolock iiso connector compatible 7pin variant allows batteryless accessories powered cameras battery existed well widely used konica minolta sony alpha digital cameras based minolta designs therefore used connector officially named autolock accessory shoe well 2012 since electrical protocol remained mostly compatible nonttl adapters exist adapt isobased flashes iiso hotshoes vice versa
sony also used variety proprietary hotshoes digital cameras including isobased 6pin cybershot hotshoe 16pin active interface shoe isobased 16pin intelligent accessory shoe cameras used proprietary smart accessory terminal versions september 2012 sony announced isobased multi interface shoe future digital cameras alpha handycam nxcam cybershot series quicklock hotshoe mechanically electrically compatible standard 2pin iso518 hotshoe electrically compatible previous autolock accessory shoe extensions passive adapters adpama adpmaa allow digitalready iiso flashes cameras multi interface shoe equipment older cameras providing compatibility standard isobased equipment well
canon uses nonisobased shoe named mini advanced shoe camcorders

internal camera circuit shorts center contact shoe mount thus triggering flash trigger voltage flash center contact shoe varied years manufacturers even manufacturer contacts shutter mechanical contacts actual voltage polarity matter much long cause arcing electronic triggering either cause problems3
10330 specification allows trigger voltage volts manufacturers particularly canon volts older flashes significantly high voltages sometimes several hundreds volts4 also negative polarity studio flashes even provide voltages whilst problem electromechanical trigger contacts older cameras electronically controlled trigger circuits newer cameras designed work inverse polarity
minolta documented cameras electronically controlled terminals shoes protected volts whereas iiso hotshoe contacts protected volts cameras
possible connect high voltage triggering flash camera tolerate volts adaptor containing necessary voltage protection circuitry typically using high power triac adapters drain power flashs trigger voltage therefore often need power supply
order avoid dangerous loops connecting equipment complex studio setups better adapters offer voltage protection galvanic isolation units adapters ensure electrical connection kind sides adapter including ground either transformers optocouplers transfer trigger impulse camera flash electronics cannot powered flash therefore needs power supply form small battery example minolta offered terminal adapter pct100 8825691 purpose worked galvanic isolator could withstand volts similar sony flash sync terminal hotshoe adapters fast1am fahs1am offer galvanic isolation well withstand voltages volts
flash servos radio triggers pocketwizard function galvanic isolators well since trigger receiver unit remain physically separate camera voltage provided local trigger unit necessary order detect cameras trigger impulse remote receiver unit handle volts flash port5 thus isolating camera flashs high voltage trigger circuit
common problem adapting flash equipment cameras excessive trigger voltage sometimes trigger circuit voltages provided modern flashes radio triggers also ensure electronic triggering circuits camera receiver still reliable trigger trigger circuit voltages volts exhibit problem unless triggering circuit specifically designed continue work voltages well
older cameras still equipped electromechanical trigger contact exhibit another problem provide hotshoe terminal typically wired trigger contact camera rather triggered independently cameras electronic triggering circuits terminal used hotshoe remains unpopulated flash high trigger circuit voltages connected terminal delivers voltage normally unprotected middle contact cameras hotshoe photographers eyebrows accidentally contact middle contact electrical shock cause pain even injuries camera manufacturers used avoid problem independent trigger contacts however could cause flash synchronization problems another utilized minolta cameras supporting terminal small hidden contact side hotshoe would disable middle contact equipment mounted hotshoe thereby avoiding possible contact operators eyebrows well
modern cold shoes devicesedit
still cold shoes shoe mount without connection often used offcamera flash units mounted stands connected camera cable triggered wireless means6
nonflash items also mounted shoe cameras instance olympus items stereo microphone three different models electronic viewfinder7 another example fotospot tagging gpses utilize hotshoe mounting camera
