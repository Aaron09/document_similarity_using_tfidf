educationedit
behaviourism focuses particular view learning change external behaviour achieved using reinforcement repetition rote learning shape behavior learners skinner found behaviors could shaped reinforcement implemented desired behavior rewarded undesired behavior punished24 incorporating behaviorism classroom allowed educators assist students excelling academically personally field language learning type teaching called audiolingual method characterised whole class using choral chanting phrases dialogues immediate correction

molar behaviorists howard rachlin richard herrnstein william baum argue behavior cannot understood focusing events moment argue behavior best understood ultimate product organisms history molecular behaviorists committing fallacy inventing fictitious proximal causes behavior molar behaviorists argue standard molecular constructs associative strength better replaced molar variables rate reinforcement30 thus molar behaviorist would describe loving someone pattern loving behavior time isolated proximal cause loving behavior history behaviors current behavior might example summarized love
