traffic control service provided groundbased traffic controllers direct aircraft ground controlled airspace provide advisory services aircraft noncontrolled airspace primary purpose worldwide prevent collisions organize expedite flow traffic provide information support pilots1 countries plays security defensive role operated military
prevent collisions enforces traffic separation rules ensure aircraft maintains minimum amount empty space around times many aircraft also collision avoidance systems provide additional safety warning pilots aircraft close
many countries provides services private military commercial aircraft operating within airspace depending type flight class airspace issue instructions pilots required obey advisories known flight information countries pilots discretion disregard pilot command final authority safe operation aircraft emergency deviate instructions extent required maintain safe operation aircraft
