economic growth traditionally attributed accumulation human physical capital increase productivity arising technological innovation13 division labor also fundamental rising productivity
industrialization technological progress resulted increase population kept check food supply resources acted limit capita income condition known malthusian trap1415 rapid economic growth occurred industrial revolution remarkable excess population growth providing escape malthusian trap16 countries industrialized eventually population growth slow phenomenon known demographic transition
increases productivity major factor responsible capita economic growth especially evident since mid19th century economic growth 20th century increased output unit labor materials energy land less input widget balance growth output come using inputs changes increase output increased output included goods produced previously goods services17
industrial revolution mechanization began replace hand methods manufacturing processes streamlined production chemicals iron steel products18 machine tools made economical production metal parts possible parts could interchangeable19 interchangeable parts
second industrial revolution major factor productivity growth substitution inanimate power human animal labor also great increase power steam powered electricity generation internal combustion supplanted limited wind water power18 since replacement great expansion total power driven continuous improvements energy conversion efficiency20 major historical sources productivity automation transportation infrastructures canals railroads highways2122 materials steel power includes steam internal combustion engines electricity productivity improvements included mechanized agriculture scientific agriculture including chemical fertilizers livestock poultry management green revolution interchangeable parts made machine tools powered electric motors evolved mass production universally used today19

economics economic history transition capitalism earlier economic systems enabled adoption government policies facilitated commerce gave individuals personal economic freedom included laws favorable establishment business including contract laws providing protection private property abolishment antiusury laws4344 property rights less certain transaction costs increase hindering economic development enforcement contractual rights necessary economic development determines rate direction investments rule absent weak enforcement property rights depends threats violence causes bias firms demonstrate reliability customers45
much literature built success story british state glorious revolution 1689 combined high fiscal capacity constraints power king generating respect rule law46474842 however others questioned institutional formula easily replicable elsewhere change constitution –and type institutions created change –does necessarily create change political power economic powers society aligned rule institutions49 england dramatic increase state’s fiscal capacity followed creation constraints crown elsewhere europe increases state capacity happened major rule reforms50
many different ways states achieved state fiscal capacity different capacity accelerated hindered economic development thanks underlying homogeneity land people england able achieve unified legal fiscal system since middle ages enabled substantially increase taxes raised 168950 hand french experience state building faced much stronger resistance local feudal powers keeping legally fiscally fragmented french revolution despite significant increases state capacity seventeenth century5152 furthermore prussia habsburg empire –much heterogeneous states england –were able increase state capacity eighteenth century without constraining powers executive50 nevertheless unlikely country generate institutions respect property rights rule without first intermediate fiscal political institutions create incentives elites support many intermediate level institutions relied informal privateorder arrangements combined publicorder institutions associated states foundations modern rule states50
many poor developing countries much land housing held outside formal legal property ownership registration system many urban areas poor invade private government land build houses hold title properties much unregistered property held informal form various property associations arrangements reasons extralegal ownership include excessive bureaucratic tape buying property building countries take steps years build government land causes extralegal property failures notarize transaction documents documents notarized failing recorded official agency53
clear legal title property limits potential used collateral secure loans depriving many poor countries important potential sources capital unregistered businesses lack accepted accounting methods factors limit potential capital53
businesses individuals participating unreported business activity owners unregistered property face costs bribes payoffs offset much taxes avoided53
democracy cause growth according acemoglu specifically democracy increases future encouraging investment increasing schooling inducing economic reforms improving public goods provision reducing social unrest54

classical growth theoryedit
classical ricardian economics theory production theory growth based theory variable proportions whereby increasing either factors production labor capital holding constant assuming technological change increase output diminishing rate eventually approach zero concepts origins thomas malthus’s theorizing agriculture malthus’s examples included number seeds harvested relative number seeds planted capital plot land size harvest plot land versus number workers employed61 diminishing returns
criticisms classical growth theory technology important factor economic growth held constant economies scale ignored62
natural rate growth
according prof harrod natural growth rate maximum rate growth allowed increase variables like population growth technological improvement growth natural resources
fact natural growth rate highest attainable growth rate would bring fullest possible employment resources existing economy
solowswan modeledit
section neoclassical growth model confused steadystate economy
robert solow63 trevor swan64 developed eventually became main model used growth economics 1950s model assumes diminishing returns capital labor capital accumulates investment level stock continually decreases depreciation diminishing returns capital increases capitalworker absent technological progress economic outputworker eventually reaches point capital worker economic outputworker remain constant annual investment capital equals annual depreciation condition called steady state
solowswan model productivity increases technological progress outputworker increases even economy steady state productivity increases constant rate outputworker also increases related steadystate rate consequence growth model occur either increasing share invested technological progress whatever share invested capitalworker eventually converges steady state leaving growth rate outputworker determined rate technological progress consequence world technology available progressing constant rate countries steady state rate growth country different level gdpworker determined share invests countries rate economic growth implicitly model rich countries invested high share long time poor countries become rich increasing share invest important prediction model mostly borne data conditional convergence idea poor countries grow faster catch rich countries long similar investment saving rates access technology
solowswan model considered exogenous growth model explain countries invest different shares capital technology improves time instead rate investment rate technological progress exogenous value model predicts pattern economic growth rates specified failure explain determinants rates limitations
although rate investment model exogenous certain conditions model implicitly predicts convergence rates investment across countries global economy global financial capital market financial capital flows countries highest return investment solowswan model countries less capitalworker poor countries higher return investment diminishing returns capital consequence capitalworker outputworker global financial capital market converge level countries65 since historically financial capital flowed countries less capitalworker basic solowswan model conceptual flaw beginning 1990s flaw addressed adding additional variables model explain countries less productive others therefore attract flows global financial capital even though less physical capitalworker

according daron acemoglu simon johnson james robinson positive correlation high income cold climate byproduct history europeans adopted different colonization policies different colonies different associated institutions places colonizers faced high mortality rates presence tropical diseases could settle permanently thus likely establish extractive institutions persisted independence places could settle permanently temperate climates established institutions objective mind modeled european homelands neoeuropes better institutions turn produced better development outcomes thus although economists focus identity type legal system colonizers explain institutions authors look environmental conditions colonies explain institutions instance former colonies inherited corrupt governments geopolitical boundaries colonizers properly placed regarding geographical locations different ethnic groups creating internal disputes conflicts hinder development another example societies emerged colonies without solid native populations established better property rights incentives longterm investment native populations large74
human capital growthedit
many theoretical empirical analyses economic growth attribute major role countrys level human capital defined skills population work force human capital included neoclassical endogenous growth models75
countrys level human capital difficult measure since created home school economists attempted measure human capital using numerous proxies including populations level literacy level numeracy level book productioncapita average level formal schooling average test score international tests cumulative depreciated investment formal schooling commonlyused measure human capital level average years school attainment country building upon data development robert barro jongwha lee76 measure widely used barro provide data numerous countries fiveyear intervals long period time

importance longrun growthedit
long periods time even small rates growth annual increase large effects example united kingdom experienced average annual increase inflationadjusted 1830 200886 1830 41373 million pounds grew 1330088 million pounds 2008 growth rate averaged years resulted 32fold increase 2008
large impact relatively small growth rate long period time power exponential growth rule mathematical result states something grows rate year level double every years example growth rate annum leads doubling within years whilst growth rate year leads doubling within years thus small difference economic growth rates countries result different standards living populations small difference continues many years
quality lifeedit
theory relates economic growth quality life threshold hypothesis states economic growth point brings increase quality life point called threshold point economic growth bring deterioration quality life87 results upsidedownushaped curve vertex curve represents level growth targeted happiness shown increase higher capita least level 15000 person88
economic growth indirect potential alleviate poverty result simultaneous increase employment opportunities increased labor productivity89 study researchers overseas development institute countries experienced growth found cases poverty alleviated89
instances quality life factors healthcare outcomes educational attainment well social political liberties improve economic growth occurs90dubious discuss
productivity increases always lead increased wages seen united states productivity wages rising since 1980s89

theories developed 1970s suggested possible avenues inequality positive effect economic development9192 savings wealthy increase inequality thought offset reduced consumer demand93
later analysis political economy approach developed alesina rodrik 1994 persson tabellini 1994 stressed negative impacts inequality economic development inequality generates pressure adopt redistributive policies adverse effect investment economic growth94 however empirical tests extended version alesina rodriks model found income inequality positively time significantly associated economic growth95
credit market imperfection approach developed galor zeira 1993 argued inequality presence credit market imperfections long lasting detrimental effect human capital formation economic development96
study perotti 1996 showed accordance credit market imperfection approach inequality associated lower level human capital formation education experience apprenticeship higher level fertility lower level human capital associated lower growth lower levels economic growth contrast examination political economy channel found support political economy mechanism97
1999 review journal economic literature stated high inequality lowers growth perhaps increases social political instability however changes degree inequality relatively minor effect growth98
research harvard economist robert barro found little overall relation income inequality rates growth investment according barro high levels inequality reduce growth relatively poor countries encourage growth richer countries99 princeton economist roland benabous research shows inequality matter growth inequality relative distribution earnings political power matter100
according andrew berg jonathan ostry 2011 international monetary fund inequality wealth income negatively correlated subsequent economic growth91 likewise economists dierk herzer sebastian vollmer found increased income inequality reduces economic growth growth also increases income inequality long run101
2013 french economist thomas piketty postulated periods average annual rate return investment capital exceeds average annual growth economic output rate inequality increase102 according piketty case wealth already held inherited expected grow rate grow rate faster wealth accumulated labor closely tied advocate reducing inequality levels piketty suggests levying global wealth order reduce divergence wealth caused inequality
