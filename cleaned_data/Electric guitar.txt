extended techniques include

string bending unique electric instrument greatly facilitated light strings typically used solidbody guitars
neck bending holding upper guitar body bending neck either front pulling back used substitute tremolo although effective much force could snap guitar neck
vibrato whammy tremolo including extreme technique dive bombing tremolo varies string tension raise lower pitch instead bending individual notes lets player bend notes sound lower higher
tapping hands applied fretboard tapping performed either onehanded twohanded extended technique executed using hand strings fingerboard thus producing legato notes tapping usually incorporates pulloffs hammerons well fingers left hand play sequence notes synchronization tapping hand
hammering string fretting hand





hammeron technique



pinch harmonics artificial harmonics sometimes called squealies technique involves adding edge thumb index finger picking hand regular picking action resulting highpitched sound
volume swell volume knob repeatedly rolled create violinlike sound result also accomplished external swell pedal although knob technique enhance showmanship conveniently eliminate need another pedal
audio feedback enhance sustain change timbre feedback become striking characteristic rock music electric guitar players jeff beck pete townshend jimi hendrix deliberately induced feedback holding guitars close amplifier reed created 1975 album metal machine music entirely loops feedback played various speeds good example feedback heard jimi hendrixs performance monterey festival entire guitar solo created using amplifier feedback24
