similarly qleibo palestinian anthropologist argues

george antonius founder modern arab nationalist history wrote seminal 1938 book arab awakening

arabs connection palestine goes back uninterruptedly earliest historic times term arab palestine denotes nowadays merely incomers arabian peninsula occupied country seventh century also older populations intermarried conquerors acquired speech customs ways thought became permanently arabised138

canaanism
claims emanating certain circles within palestinian society supporters proposing palestinians direct ancestral connections ancient canaanites without intermediate israelite link issue contention within context israeli–palestinian conflict bernard lewis wrote rewriting past usually undertaken achieve specific political aims bypassing biblical israelites claiming kinship canaanites preisraelite inhabitants palestine possible assert historical claim antedating biblical promise possession forward jews139140
