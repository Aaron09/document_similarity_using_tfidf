epidemiologyedit
cases ways possible obtain exact mortality rates epidemiologists estimation predict correct mortality rates mortality rates usually difficult predict language barriers health infrastructure related issues conflict reasons maternal mortality additional challenges especially pertain stillbirths abortions multiple births countries 1920s stillbirth defined birth least twenty weeks gestation child shows evidence life complete birth countries however stillbirth defined ‘the birth fetus weeks pregnancy pulmonary respiration occur9
census data vital statisticsedit
ideally mortality estimation would done using vital statistics census data census data give detailed information population risk death vital statistics provide information live births deaths population often either census data vital statistics data available especially true developing countries countries conflict areas natural disasters caused mass displacement areas humanitarian crisis
household surveysedit
household surveys interviews another mortality rates often assessed several methods estimate mortality different segments population example sisterhood method technique involves researchers estimating maternal mortality contacting women populations interest asking whether sister sister childrearing usually conducting interview written questions possible deaths among sisters sisterhood method however work cases sisters died sister interviewed born11
orphanhood surveys estimate mortality questioning children asked mortality parents often criticized adult mortality rate biased several reasons adoption effect instance orphans often realize adopted additionally interviewers realize adoptive foster parent child’s biological parent also issue parents reported multiple children adults children thus counted mortality estimates
widowhood surveys estimate adult mortality responding questions deceased husband wife limitation widowhood survey surrounds issues divorce people likely report widowed places great social stigma around divorcee another limitation multiple marriages introduce biased estimates individuals often asked first marriage biases significant association death spouses countries large aids epidemics
samplingedit
sampling refers selection subset population interest efficiently gain information entire population samples representative population interest cluster sampling approach nonprobability sampling approach member population assigned group cluster clusters randomly selected members selected clusters included sample often combined stratification techniques case called multistage sampling cluster sampling approach often used epidemiologists areas forced migration significant sampling error thus cluster sampling ideal choice12
