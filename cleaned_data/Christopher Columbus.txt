geographical considerations
washington irvings 1828 biography columbus popularized idea columbus difficulty obtaining support plan many catholic theologians insisted earth flat31 fact nearly educated westerners understood least since time aristotle earth spherical3230 sphericity earth also accounted work ptolemy medieval astronomy largely based christian writers whose works clearly reflect conviction earth spherical include saint bede venerable reckoning time written around columbuss time techniques celestial navigation position stars together understanding earth sphere long astronomers beginning implemented mariners33

toscanellis notions geography atlantic ocean shown superimposed modern directly influenced columbuss plans


daillys imago mundi columbus learned alfraganuss estimate degree latitude degree longitude along equator spanned miles realize expressed arabic mile rather shorter roman mile familiar 1480 therefore estimated circumference earth 30200 whereas correct value 40000 25000

columbus therefore estimated distance canary islands japan 3000 italian miles 3700 2300 statute miles true figure known vastly larger 20000 km38c ship 15th century could carried enough food fresh water long voyage dangers involved navigating uncharted ocean would formidable european navigators reasonably concluded westward voyage europe asia unfeasible catholic monarchs however completed expensive iberian peninsula eager obtain competitive edge european countries quest trade indies columbuss project though farfetched held promise advantage
