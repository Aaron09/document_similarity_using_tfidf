basic prototype categoriesedit
prototypes explore different aspects intended design

proofofprinciple prototype serves verify functional aspects intended design usually functionality final product
working prototype represents nearly functionality final product
visual prototype represents size appearance functionality intended design form study prototype preliminary type visual prototype geometric features design emphasized less concern color texture aspects final appearance
user experience prototype represents enough appearance function product used user research
functional prototype captures function appearance intended design though created different techniques even different scale final design67
paper prototype printed handdrawn representation user interface software product prototypes commonly used early testing software design part software walkthrough confirm design decisions costly levels design effort expended8

general creation prototypes differ creation final product fundamental ways

material materials used final product expensive difficult fabricate prototypes made different materials final product cases final production materials still undergoing development available prototype
process massproduction processes often unsuitable making small number parts prototypes made using different fabrication processes final product example final product made plastic injection molding require expensive custom tooling prototype product fabricated machining stereolithography instead differences fabrication process lead differences appearance prototype compared final product
verification final product subject number quality assurance tests verify conformance drawings specifications tests involve custom inspection fixtures statistical sampling methods techniques appropriate ongoing production large quantity final product prototypes generally made much closer individual inspection assumption adjustment rework part fabrication process prototypes also exempted requirements apply final product

engineers prototype specialists attempt minimize impact differences intended role prototype example visual prototype able materials final product attempt substitute materials properties closely simulate intended final materials
characteristics limitations prototypesedit




prototype polish economy hatchback beskid designed 1980s


engineers prototyping specialists seek understand limitations prototypes exactly simulate characteristics intended design
important realize definition prototypes represent compromise final production design differences materials processes design fidelity possible prototype fail perform acceptably whereas production design sound counterintuitive idea prototypes actually perform acceptably whereas production design flawed since prototyping materials processes occasionally outperform production counterparts
general expected individual prototype costs substantially greater final production costs inefficiencies materials processes prototypes also used revise design purposes reducing costs optimization refinement9
possible prototype testing reduce risk design perform intended however prototypes generally cannot eliminate risk pragmatic practical limitations ability prototype match intended final performance product allowances engineering judgement often required moving forward production design
building full design often expensive timeconsuming especially repeated several times—building full design figuring problems solve building another full design alternative rapid prototyping rapid application development techniques used initial prototypes implement part complete design allows designers manufacturers rapidly inexpensively test parts design likely problems solve problems build full design
counterintuitive idea—that quickest build something first build something else—is shared scaffolding telescope rule
engineering sciencesedit
technology research technology demonstrator prototype serving proofofconcept demonstration model technology future product proving viability illustrating conceivable applications
large development projects testbed platform prototype development environment rigorous experimentation testing technologies components scientific theories computational tools10
recent advances computer modeling becoming practical eliminate creation physical prototype except possibly greatly reduced scales promotional purposes instead modeling aspects final product computer model example development seen boeing dreamliner first full sized physical realization made series production line computer modeling extensively used automotive design form styling aerodynamics vehicle function—especially improving vehicle crashworthiness weight reduction improve mileage
mechanical electrical engineeringedit
common word prototype functional although experimental version nonmilitary machine automobiles domestic appliances consumer electronics whose designers would like built mass production means opposed mockup inert representation machines appearance often made nondurable substance
electronics designer often builds first prototype breadboard stripboard perfboard typically using packages
however often first functional prototype built prototype almost identical production manufacturing prices fall many components available packages available packages optimized placing
builders military machines aviation prefer terms experimental service test11
electronics prototypingedit




simple electronic circuit prototype breadboard






example prototype optoelectronics texas instruments cinema prototype system


electronics prototyping means building actual circuit theoretical design verify works provide physical platform debugging prototype often constructed using techniques wire wrapping using veroboard breadboard result circuit electrically identical design physically identical final product12
opensource tools like fritzing exist document electronic prototypes especially breadboardbased ones move toward physical production prototyping platforms arduino also simplify task programming interacting microcontroller13 developer choose deploy invention asis using prototyping platform replace microcontroller chip circuitry relevant product
technician quickly build prototype make additions modifications using techniques volume production much faster usually cheaper massproduce custom printed circuit boards produce kinds prototype boards proliferation quickturn fabrication assembly companies enabled concepts rapid prototyping applied electronic circuit design possible even smallest passive components largest finepitch packages boards fabricated assembled even tested matter days
computer programmingcomputer scienceedit
main articles software prototyping software release cycle
many programming languages function prototype declaration subroutine function confused software prototyping term rather ccspecific terms notion signature type interface prototypebased programming form objectoriented programming objects produced cloning existing objects called prototypes14
term also refer prototype javascript framework
additionally term refer prototype design pattern
prototype software often referred alpha grade meaning first version often functions implemented primary focus alpha functional base code features added alpha grade software required features integrated becomes beta software testing entire software adjust program respond correctly situations unforeseen development15
often users able provide complete application objectives detailed input processing output requirements initial stage user evaluation another prototype built based feedback users cycle returns customer evaluation cycle starts listening user followed building revising mockup letting user test mockup back generation tools called application simulation software help quickly simulate application development
extreme programming uses iterative design gradually feature time initial prototype
continuous learning approaches within organizations businesses also concept business process prototypes software models
