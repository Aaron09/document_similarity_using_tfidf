introductionedit
basic types data needed construct price data weighting data price data collected sample goods services sample sales outlets sample locations sample times weighting data estimates shares different types expenditure total expenditure covered index weights usually based upon expenditure data obtained expenditure surveys sample households upon estimates composition consumption expenditure national income product accounts although sampling items price collection done using sampling frame probabilistic sampling methods many items outlets chosen commonsense purposive sampling permit estimation confidence intervals therefore sampling variance cannot calculated case single estimate required purposes index used
index usually computed monthly quarterly countries weighted average subindices different components consumer expenditure food housing shoes clothing turn weighted average subsubindices detailed level elementary aggregate level example mens shirts sold department stores francisco detailed weighting information unavailable indices computed using unweighted arithmetic geometric mean prices sampled product offers however growing scanner data gradually making weighting information available even detailed level indices compare prices month prices pricereference month weights used combine higherlevel aggregates overall index relate estimated expenditures preceding whole year consumers covered index products within scope area covered thus index fixedweight index rarely true laspeyres index since weightreference period year pricereference period usually recent single month coincide takes time assemble process information used weighting addition household expenditure surveys include trade data
ideally weights would relate composition expenditure time pricereference month current month large technical economics literature index formulae would approximate shown approximate economic theorists call true cost living index index would show consumer expenditure would move compensate price changes allow consumers maintain constant standard living approximations computed retrospectively whereas index appear monthly preferably quite soon nevertheless countries notably united states sweden philosophy index inspired approximates notion true cost living constant utility index whereas europe regarded pragmatically
coverage index limited consumers expenditure abroad usually excluded visitors expenditure within country excluded principle practice rural population included certain groups rich poor excluded saving investment always excluded though prices paid financial services provided financial intermediaries included along insurance
index reference period usually called base year often differs weightreference period price reference period matter rescaling whole timeseries make value index referenceperiod equal annually revised weights desirable expensive feature index older weights greater divergence current expenditure pattern weight referenceperiod

convention weights fractions ratios summing percentages summing mille numbers summing 1000citation needed
european unions harmonised index consumer prices hicp example country computes prescribed subindices weighted average constituting national hicp weights subindices consist weights number component lower level indices classification according developed national accounting context necessarily kind classification appropriate consumer price index grouping together substitutes products whose prices tend move parallel might suitable
lower level indices detailed reweighing make available allowing computations individual price observations weighted case example selling hands single national organisation makes data available index compilers lower level indices however weight consist weights number elementary aggregate indices weight corresponding fraction total annual expenditure covered index elementary aggregate lowestlevel component expenditure weight within weights subcomponents usually lacking thus example weighted averages elementary aggregate indices mens shirts raincoats womens dresses make level indices outer garments
weight averages turn provide subindices higher aggregated leveleg clothing weighted averages latter provide aggregated subindices clothing footwear
elementary aggregate indices subindices defined simply terms types goods andor services cover case products newspapers countries postal services nationally uniform prices price movements differ might differ regions outlet types separate regional andor outlettype elementary aggregates ideally required detailed category goods services weight example might elementary aggregate sliced bread sold supermarkets northern region
elementary aggregate indices necessarily unweighted averages sample products within sampled outlets however cases possible select sample outlets prices collected reflect shares sales consumers different outlet types covered selfweighted elementary aggregate indices computed similarly market shares different types product represented product types known even approximately number observed products priced made proportional shares
estimating weightsedit
outlet regional dimensions noted mean estimation weights involves breakdown expenditure types goods services number separately weighted indices composing overall index depends upon factors

degree detail available data permit breakdown total consumption expenditure weight referenceperiod type expenditure region outlet type
whether reason believe price movements vary detailed categories

weights calculated much detail depends upon availability information upon scope index retail price index relate whole consumption reference population private households exception pensioner households derive least threequarters total income state pensions benefits high income households whose total household income lies within four cent households result difficult data sources relating total consumption population groups
products whose price movements differ regions different types outlet

ideal rarely realisable practice would consist estimates expenditure detailed consumption category type outlet region
opposite extreme regional data expenditure totals population northern region national estimates shares different outlet types broad categories consumption food sold supermarkets weight sliced bread sold supermarkets northern region estimated share sliced bread total consumption

situation countries comes somewhere extremes point make best whatever data available
nature data used weighingedit
firm rules suggested issue simple reason available statistical sources differ countries however countries conduct periodical household expenditure surveys produce breakdowns consumption expenditure national accounts expenditure classifications used however different particular

household expenditure surveys cover expenditures foreign visitors though within scope consumer price index
national accounts include imputed rents owneroccupied dwellings within scope consumer price index

even necessary adjustments national account estimates household expenditure surveys usually diverge
statistical sources required regional outlettype breakdowns usually weaker largesample household expenditure survey provide regional breakdown regional population data sometimes used purpose need adjustment allow regional differences living standards consumption patterns statistics retail sales market research reports provide information estimating outlettype breakdowns classifications rarely correspond coicop categories
increasingly widespread codes scanners shops meant detailed cash register printed receipts provided shops increasing share retail purchases development makes possible improved household expenditure surveys statistics iceland demonstrated survey respondents keeping diary purchases need record total purchases itemised receipts given keep receipts special pocket diary receipts provide detailed breakdown purchases also name outlet thus response burden markedly reduced accuracy increased product description specific point purchase data obtained facilitating estimation outlettype weights
general principles estimation weights available information accept rough estimates better estimates
reweighingedit
ideally computing index weights would represent current annual expenditure patterns practice necessarily reflect past using recent data available high quality average data previous year countries used threeyear average recognition fact household survey estimates poor quality cases data sources used available annually case weights lower level aggregates within higher level aggregates based older data higher level weights
infrequent reweighing saves costs national statistical office delays introduction index types expenditure example subscriptions internet service entered index compilation considerable time countries account could taken digital camera prices reweightings including digital cameras elementary aggregate film cameras
owneroccupiers price indexedit
owneroccupied dwellings dealt consumer price index remains subject heated controversy many countries various considered advantages disadvantagescitation needed
economists approachedit
also imputed rent
leaving aside quality public services environment crime forth regarding standard living function level composition individuals consumption standard depends upon amount range goods services consume include service provided rented accommodation readily priced similar services yielded flat house owned consumer occupies cost consumer according economic thinking opportunity cost namely sacrifices living cost according many economists form component consumer price index
opportunity cost looked ways since alternatives continuing live owneroccupied dwelling supposing years cost considered sell earn interest owners capital thus released back year later making allowance physical depreciation called alternative cost approach rental equivalent approach someone else year case cost rent could obtained
course practical problems implementing either economists approaches thus alternative cost approach house prices rising fast cost negative become sharply positive house prices start fall index would volatile hand rental equivalent approach difficulty estimating movement rental values types property actually rented measures consumption services owneroccupied dwellings included consumption must included income income equals consumption plus saving means movement incomes compared movement consumer price index incomes must expressed money income plus imaginary consumption value logical users index want
although argument expressed connection owneroccupied dwellings logic applies equally durable consumer goods services furniture carpets domestic appliances used soon purchase food like dwellings yield consumption service continue years furthermore since strict logic adhered durable services well ought treated service consumers derive appendectomies crowned teeth continue long time since estimating values components consumption tackled economic theorists torn desire intellectual consistency recognition inclusion opportunity cost durables impracticablecitation needed
spendingedit
another approach concentrate spending3citation needed everyone agrees repairs maintenance expenditure owneroccupied dwellings covered consumer price index spending approach would include mortgage interest turns quite complicated conceptually well practice
explain involved consider consumer price index computed reference 2009 sole consumer bought house 2006 financing half raising mortgage problem compare much interest consumer would paying interest paid 2009 since compare like like requires estimate much interest would paid year 2010 similar house bought mortgagefinanced three years 2007 require estimate much identical person paying actual house bought 2006 even though personally concerns
consumer price index compares much would cost exactly consumers referenceperiod cost application principle thus requires index house owner reflect movement prices houses like 2006 2007 change interest rates took fixedinterest rate mortgage change interest rates 2006 2007 counts took variable interest mortgage change 2009 2010 counts thus current index 1999 referenceperiod stand house prices case fixedinterest mortgage interest rates rose 2006 2007
application principle owneroccupied dwellings component consumer price index known debt profile method means current movement index reflect past changes dwelling prices interest rates people regard quite countries debt profile method behave inconsistently consistency would require index also cover interest consumer credit instead whole price paid products bought credit covers mortgage interest payments products bought credit would treated owneroccupied dwellings
variants debt profile method employed proposed example include payments well interest another correct nominal mortgage rates changes dwelling prices changes rest consumer price index obtain real rate interest also methods used alongside debt profile method thus several countries include purely notional cost depreciation additional index component applying arbitrarily estimated rather guessed depreciation rate value stock owneroccupied dwellings finally country includes mortgage interest purchase prices index
transaction pricesedit
third approach simply treats acquisition owneroccupied dwellings acquisitions durable products treated means taking account transaction prices agreed

ignoring whether payments delayed partly financed borrowing
leaving secondhand transactions secondhand purchases correspond sales consumers thus dwellings would included

furthermore expenditure enlarging reconstructing owneroccupied dwelling would covered addition regular maintenance repair arguments almost theological character advanced connection transactions approach
argument purchases dwellings treated investment system national accounts enter consumption price index said matter terminological uniformity example thought help understanding facilitate economic analysis included heading consumption consumer price index national income expenditure accounts since accounts include equivalent rental value owneroccupied dwellings equivalent rental approach would applied consumer price index national accounts apply durables argument demands consistency respect accepts rejection another
argument prices dwellings exclude part reflecting value land since irreproducible permanent asset cannot said consumed would presumably mean deducting site value price dwelling site value presumably defined price site would fetch auction dwelling understood case multiple dwellings remains unclearcitation needed
confusionedit
apparent much muddle discussing merits different approaches arises promiscuous mixing arguments feasibility dislike approval index would move particular approach principles various often incompatible sorts feasibility naturally important difficulty dealing site values obvious
statisticians country lacking good dwelling price index required except rental equivalent method along proposal index obtain necessary additional resources enable compile even obtaining mortgage interest rate data major task country multitude mortgage lenders many types mortgage dislike effect upon behaviour consumer price index arising adoption methods powerful sometimes unprincipled argument
dwelling prices volatile therefore would index incorporating current value dwelling price subindex countries would large weight third approach furthermore weight owneroccupied dwellings could altered considerably reweighting undertaken could even become negative alternative cost approach weights estimated year house prices rising steeply
point rise interest rates designed halt inflation could paradoxically make inflation appear higher current interest rates showed index economists principles acceptable insistence upon consistency treatment owneroccupied dwellings durables
consumer price indices united statesedit
main article united states consumer price index
united states several different consumer price indices routinely computed bureau labor statistics include cpiu urban consumers cpiw urban wage earners clerical workers cpie elderly ccpiu chained urban consumers built stages first collects data estimate 8018 separate itemarea indices reflecting prices categories consumption items geographical areas second stage weighted averages computed 8018 itemarea indices different indices differ weights applied different 8018 itemarea indices weights cpiu cpiw held constant months changing january evennumbered years weights ccpiu updated month reflecting changes consumption patterns last month thus people average chicken less beef apples fewer oranges previous month change would reflected next months ccpiu however would reflected cpiu cpiw january next evennumbered year3
