apoptosis ancient greek ἀπόπτωσις falling process programmed cell death occurs multicellular organisms2 biochemical events lead characteristic cell changes morphology death changes include blebbing cell shrinkage nuclear fragmentation chromatin condensation chromosomal fragmentation globalvague mrna decay billion cells apoptosis average human adulta average child ages approximately billion cells day4
contrast necrosis form traumatic cell death results acute cellular injury apoptosis highly regulated controlled process confers advantages organisms lifecycle example separation fingers toes developing human embryo occurs cells digits undergo apoptosis unlike necrosis apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies phagocytic cells able engulf remove contents cell spill onto surrounding cells cause damage them5
apoptosis cannot stop begun highly regulated process apoptosis initiated pathways intrinsic pathway cell kills senses cell stress extrinsic pathway cell kills signals cells pathways induce cell death activating caspases proteases enzymes degrade proteins pathways activate initiator caspases activate executioner caspases kill cell degrading proteins indiscriminately
research apoptosis increased substantially since early 1990s addition importance biological phenomenon defective apoptotic processes implicated wide variety diseases excessive apoptosis causes atrophy whereas insufficient amount results uncontrolled cell proliferation cancer factors like receptors caspases promote apoptosis members bcl2 family proteins inhibit apoptosis
