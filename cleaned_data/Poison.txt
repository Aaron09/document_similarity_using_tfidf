living things produce substances protect getting eaten term poison usually used substances poisonous humans substances mainly poisonous common pathogen organism humans considered antibiotics bacteria example common adversary penicillium chrysogenum mold humans since molds poison targets bacteria humans getting bacteria bodies human antimicrobial peptides toxic viruses fungi bacteria cancerous cells considered part immune system8
nuclear physics poison substance obstructs inhibits nuclear reaction example nuclear poison
environmentally hazardous substances necessarily poisons vice versa example foodindustry wastewater—which contain potato juice milk—can hazardous ecosystems streams rivers consuming oxygen causing eutrophication nonhazardous humans classified poison
biologically speaking substance given large enough amounts poisonous cause death instance several kilograms worth water would constitute lethal dose many substances used medications—such fentanyl—have ld50 order magnitude greater ed50 alternative classification distinguishes lethal substances provide therapeutic value
poisoningedit
main article poisoning
acute poisoning exposure poison occasion short period time symptoms develop close relation exposure absorption poison necessary systemic poisoning contrast substances destroy tissue absorb classified corrosives rather poisons furthermore many common household medications labeled skull crossbones although cause severe illness even death medical sense poisoning caused less dangerous substances legally classified poison
chronic poisoning longterm repeated continuous exposure poison symptoms occur immediately exposure patient gradually becomes becomes long latent period chronic poisoning commonly occurs following exposure poisons bioaccumulate biomagnified mercury gadolinium lead
contact absorption poisons cause rapid death impairment agents nervous system paralyze seconds less include biologically derived neurotoxins socalled nerve gases synthesized warfare industry
inhaled ingested cyanide used method execution chambers almost instantly starves body energy inhibiting enzymes mitochondria make intravenous injection unnaturally high concentration potassium chloride execution prisoners parts united states quickly stops heart eliminating cell potential necessary muscle contraction
biocides including pesticides created poisons target organisms although acute less observable chronic poisoning also occur nontarget organisms secondary poisoning including humans apply biocides beneficial organisms example herbicide imitates action plant hormone makes lethal toxicity specific plants indeed poison classified harmful
many substances regarded poisons toxic indirectly toxication example wood alcohol methanol poisonous chemically converted toxic formaldehyde formic acid liver many drug molecules made toxic liver genetic variability certain liver enzymes makes toxicity many compounds differ individuals
exposure radioactive substances produce radiation poisoning unrelated phenomenon
managementedit

initial management poisonings includes ensuring adequate cardiopulmonary function providing treatment symptoms seizures shock pain
injected poisons sting animals treated binding affected body part pressure bandage placing affected body part water temperature pressure bandage prevents poison pumped throughout body water breaks treatment however works poisons composed proteinmolecules9
majority poisonings mainstay management providing supportive care patient treating symptoms rather poison

decontaminationedit

treatment recently ingested poison involve gastric decontamination decrease absorption gastric decontamination involve activated charcoal gastric lavage whole bowel irrigation nasogastric aspiration routine emetics syrup ipecac cathartics laxatives longer recommended

activated charcoal treatment choice prevent poison absorption usually administered patient emergency room trained emergency healthcare provider paramedic however charcoal ineffective metals sodium potassium lithium alcohols glycols also recommended ingestion corrosive chemicals acids alkalis10
cathartics postulated decrease absorption increasing expulsion poison gastrointestinal tract types cathartics used poisoned patients saline cathartics sodium sulfate magnesium citrate magnesium sulfate saccharide cathartics sorbitol appear improve patient outcome longer recommended11
emesis induced ipecac longer recommended poisoning situations vomiting ineffective removing poisons12
gastric lavage commonly known stomach pump insertion tube stomach followed administration water saline tube liquid removed along contents stomach lavage used many years common treatment poisoned patients however recent review procedure poisonings suggests benefit13 still sometimes used performed within hour ingestion exposure potentially lifethreatening
nasogastric aspiration involves placement tube nose stomach stomach contents removed suction procedure mainly used liquid ingestions activated charcoal ineffective ethylene glycol poisoning
whole bowel irrigation cleanses bowel achieved giving patient large amounts polyethylene glycol solution osmotically balanced polyethylene glycol solution absorbed body effect flushing entire gastrointestinal tract major uses treat ingestion sustained release drugs toxins absorbed activated charcoal lithium iron removal ingested drug packets body packingsmuggling14



enhanced excretionedit

situations elimination poison enhanced using diuresis hemodialysis hemoperfusion hyperbaric medicine peritoneal dialysis exchange transfusion chelation however actually worsen poisoning cases always verified based substances involved

applicationsedit
poisonous compounds useful either toxicity often another chemical property specific chemical reactivity poisons widely used industry agriculture chemical reagents solvents complexing reagents carbon monoxide methanol sodium cyanide respectively less common household occasional exceptions ammonia methanol instance phosgene highly reactive nucleophile acceptor makes excellent reagent polymerizing diols diamines produce polycarbonate polyurethane plastics millions tons produced annually however reactivity makes also highly reactive towards proteins human tissue thus highly toxic fact phosgene used chemical weapon contrasted mustard produced chemical weapons uses particular industrial
biocides need poisonous humans target metabolic pathways absent humans leaving incidental toxicity instance herbicide 24dichlorophenoxyacetic acid mimic plant growth hormone causes uncontrollable growth leading death plant humans animals lacking hormone receptor unaffected need ingest relatively large doses toxicity appears human toxicity however hard avoid pesticides targeting mammals rodenticides
risk toxicity also distinct toxicity instance preservative thiomersal used vaccines toxic quantity administered single shot negligible
