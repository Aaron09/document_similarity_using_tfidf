photophone receiver headset half bell tainters optical telecommunication system 1880


photophone similar contemporary telephone except used modulated light means wireless transmission telephone relied modulated electricity carried conductive wire circuit
bells description light modulator12

found simplest form apparatus producing effect consists plane mirror flexible material back speakers voice directed action voice mirror becomes alternately convex concave thus alternately scatters condenses light

brightness reflected beam light observed location receiver therefore varied accordance audiofrequency variations pressure—the sound waves—which acted upon mirror
initial form photophone receiver also nonelectronic bell found many substances could used direct lighttosound transducers lampblack proved outstanding using fully modulated beam sunlight test signal experimental receiver design employing deposit lampblack produced tone bell described painfully loud pressed close device
ultimate electronic form photophone receiver used simple selenium cell focus parabolic mirror5 cells electrical resistance ohms varied inversely light falling upon resistance higher dimly lower brightly selenium cell took place carbon microphone—also variableresistance device—in circuit otherwise essentially ordinary telephone consisting battery electromagnetic earphone variable resistance connected series selenium modulated current flowing circuit current converted back variations pressure—sound—by earphone
speech american association advancement science august 1880 bell gave credit first demonstration speech transmission light brown london fall 1878513
device used radiant energy french scientist ernest mercadier suggested invention named photophone radiophone mirrors reflected suns radiant energy multiple bands including invisible infrared band14 bell used name confused later invention radiophone used radio waves15

honeymooning europe bride mabel hubbard bell likely read newly discovered property selenium variable resistance acted upon light paper robert sabine published nature april 1878 experiments sabine used meter effects light acting selenium connected circuit battery however bell reasoned adding telephone receiver circuit would able hear sabine could see16

february 1880 pair managed make functional photophone laboratory attaching metallic gratings diaphragm beam light interrupted gratings movement response spoken sounds modulated light beam fell upon selenium receiver bell headphones able clearly hear tainter singing auld lang syne18
april 1880 washington experiment bell tainter communicated metres meters along alleyway laboratorys rear window months later june succeeded communicating clearly distance meters using plain sunlight light source practical electrical lighting introduced edison transmitter latter experiments sunlight reflected surface thin mirror positioned speaking tube words spoken cause mirror oscillate convex concave altering amount light reflected surface receiver tainter roof franklin school spoke bell laboratory listening signaled back tainter waving vigorously window requested6

alexander graham bell letter father alexander melville bell dated february 1880

bell transferred photophones intellectual property rights american bell telephone company 188024 bell hoped photophone could used ships also displace plethora telephone lines blooming along busy city boulevards25 design failed protect transmissions outdoor interferences clouds rain snow could easily disrupt transmission light26 factors weather lack light inhibited bells invention27 long invention laboratories within bell system continued improve photophone hope could supplement replace expensive conventional telephone lines earliest nonexperimental came military communication systems world advantage lightbased transmissions could intercepted enemy
bell pondered photophones possible scientific spectral analysis artificial light sources stars sunspots later also speculated possible future applications though anticipate either laser fiberoptic telecommunications23

imagination picture future invention talk light visible distance without conduction wire general science discoveries make photophone undreamed

developmentedit
although bell telephone researchers made several modest incremental improvements bell tainters design marconis radio transmissions started surpass maximum range photophone early 18978 development photophone largely arrested germanaustrian experiments began turn 20th century german siemens halske company boosted photophones range utilizing currentmodulated carbon lamps provided useful range approximately kilometres produced units commercially german navy adapted increase range kilometres using voicemodulated ship searchlights5
british admiralty research resulted development vibrating mirror modulator 1916 sensitive molybdenite receiver cells also greater sensitivity infrared radiation replaced older selenium cells 19175 united states german governments also worked technical improvements bells system28
1935 german carl zeiss company started producing infrared photophones german armys tank battalions employing tungsten lamps infrared filters modulated vibrating mirrors prisms also used receivers employed lead sulphide detector cells amplifiers boosting range kilometres optimal conditions japanese italian armies also attempted similar development lightwave telecommunications 19455
several military laboratories including united states continued efforts photophone 1950s experimenting highpressure vapour mercury lamps 2000 watts power5
