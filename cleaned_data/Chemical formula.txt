chemical formula expressing information proportions atoms constitute particular chemical compound molecule using single line chemical element symbols numbers sometimes also symbols parentheses dashes brackets commas plus minus signs limited single typographic line symbols include subscripts superscripts chemical formula chemical name contains words although chemical formula imply certain simple chemical structures full chemical structural formula chemical formulas fully specify structure simplest molecules chemical substances generally limited power chemical names structural formulas
simplest types chemical formulas called empirical formulas letters numbers indicating numerical proportions atoms type molecular formulas indicate simple numbers type atom molecule information structure example empirical formula glucose ch2o twice many hydrogen atoms carbon oxygen molecular formula c6h12o6 hydrogen atoms carbon oxygen atoms
sometimes chemical formula complicated written condensed formula condensed molecular formula occasionally called semistructural formula conveys additional information particular ways atoms chemically bonded together either covalent bonds ionic bonds various combinations types possible relevant bonding easy show dimension example condensed molecularchemical formula ethanol ch3ch2oh ch3ch2oh however even condensed chemical formula necessarily limited ability show complex bonding relationships atoms especially atoms bonds four different substituents
since chemical formula must expressed single line chemical element symbols often cannot informative true structural formula graphical representation spatial relationship atoms chemical compounds example figure butane structural chemical formulas right reasons structural complexity condensed chemical formula semistructural formula specifies glucose exist many different molecules example fructose mannose molecular formula c6h12o6 glucose linear equivalent chemical names exist specify complex structural formula chemical nomenclature names must many terms words rather simple element symbols numbers simple typographical symbols define chemical formula
chemical formulas used chemical equations describe chemical reactions chemical transformations dissolving ionic compounds solution noted chemical formulas full power structural formulas show chemical relationships atoms sufficient keep track numbers atoms numbers electrical charges chemical reactions thus balancing chemical equations equations used chemical problems involving conservation atoms conservation electric charge

condensed semistructural formula ch3ch2ch2ch3


connectivity molecule often strong influence physical chemical properties behavior molecules composed numbers types atoms pair isomers might completely different chemical andor physical properties atoms connected differently different positions cases structural formula useful illustrates atoms bonded ones connectivity often possible deduce approximate shape molecule
condensed chemical formula represent types spatial arrangement bonds simple chemical substance though necessarily specify isomers complex structures example ethane consists carbon atoms singlebonded carbon atom three hydrogen atoms bonded chemical formula rendered ch3ch3 ethylene double bond carbon atoms thus carbon hydrogens therefore chemical formula written ch2ch2 fact double bond carbons implicit carbon valence four however explicit method write h2cch2 less commonly h2cch2 lines pairs dots indicate double bond connects atoms either side
triple bond expressed three lines hc≡ch three pairs dots hcch ambiguity single line pair dots used indicate single bond
molecules multiple functional groups expressed enclosing repeated group round brackets example isobutane written ch33ch condensed structural formula implies different connectivity molecules formed using atoms proportions isomers formula ch33ch implies central carbon atom connected hydrogen atom three groups number atoms element hydrogens carbons c4h10 used make straight chain molecule nbutane ch3ch2ch2ch3
compositionedit
given chemical compound elements always combine proportion constant composition
constant composition says particular chemical compound samples compound made elements proportion ratio example water molecule always made hydrogen atoms oxygen atom ratio look relative masses oxygen hydrogen water molecule mass water molecule accounted oxygen remaining mass hydrogen mass proportion water molecule1
chemical names answer limitations chemical formulasedit
main article chemical nomenclature
