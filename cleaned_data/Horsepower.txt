metric horsepower needed lift kilograms meter second


development steam engine provided reason compare output horses engines could replace 1702 thomas savery wrote miners friend

engine raise much water horses working together time work must constantly kept twelve horses engine made large enough work required employing eight fifteen twenty horses constantly maintained kept work…4

idea later used james watt help market improved steam engine previously agreed take royalties third savings coal older newcomen steam engines5 royalty scheme work customers existing steam engines used horses instead
watt determined horse could turn mill wheel times hour times minute6 wheel feet radius therefore horse travelled feet minute watt judged horse could pull force poundsforce
