philosophical thoughtedit
rawls published three main books first theory justice focused distributive justice attempted reconcile competing claims values freedom equality second political liberalism addressed question citizens divided intractable religious philosophical disagreements could come endorse constitutional democratic regime third peoples focused issue global justice
theory justiceedit
rawlss first work published 1971 aimed resolve seemingly competing claims freedom equality shape rawlss resolution took however balancing compromised weakened moral claim value compared rather intent show notions freedom equality could integrated seamless unity called justice fairness explaining proper perspective take thinking justice rawls hoped show supposed conflict freedom equality illusory
rawlss theory justice 1971 includes thought experiment called original position intuition motivating employment enterprise political philosophy greatly benefited specification correct standpoint person take thinking justice think would mean state affairs obtain persons eliminate certain features hair color height race fixate upon others rawlss original position meant encode intuitions features relevant irrelevant purposes deliberating well justice
original position rawls hypothetical scenario group persons task reaching agreement kind political economic structure want society occupy individual however deliberates behind veil ignorance lacks knowledge example gender race intelligence wealth skills education religion thing given member knows possession basic capacities necessary fully willfully participate enduring system mutual cooperation knows member society
rawls posits basic capacities individuals would know possess first individuals know capacity form pursue revise conception good life plan exactly sort conception good however individual know example religious secular start individual original position know second individual understands capacity develop sense justice generally effective desire abide knowing features group deliberate order design social structure person seek maximal advantage idea proposals would ordinarily think unjust blacks women allowed hold public office proposed rawls original position would irrational propose reason simple know whether would woman black person position expressed maximin principle according system ignorance ones status would strive improve position worst might find position
rawls develops original position modeling certain respects least initial situations various social contract thinkers came including thomas hobbes john locke jeanjacques rousseau social contractarian constructs hisher initial situation somewhat differently mind unique political morality intends thought experiment generate25 iain king suggested original position draws rawls experiences postwar japan army challenged designing social political authorities country imagining away gone before26
social justice processes person early makes decisions features persons consider ignore rawlss aspiration created thought experiment whereby version process carried completion illuminating correct standpoint person take thinking justice succeeded original position thought experiment function full specification moral standpoint attempt achieve deliberating social justice
setting theory rawls described method reflective equilibrium concept since used areas philosophy reflective equilibrium achieved mutually adjusting ones general principles ones considered judgements particular cases bring line another
principles justiceedit
rawls derives principles justice original position first liberty principle establishes equal basic liberties citizens basic liberty entails familiar liberal tradition freedoms conscience association expression well democratic rights rawls also includes personal property right defended terms moral capacities selfrespect27 rather appeal natural right selfownership distinguishes rawlss account classical liberalism john locke libertarianism robert nozick
rawls argues second principle equality would agreed upon guarantee liberties represent meaningful options society ensure distributive justice example formal guarantees political voice freedom assembly little real worth desperately poor marginalized society demanding everyone exactly effective opportunities life would almost certainly offend liberties supposedly equalized nonetheless would want ensure least fair worth liberties wherever ends society wants life worth living enough effective freedom pursue personal goals thus participants would moved affirm twopart second principle comprising fair equality opportunity famous controversial28 difference principle second principle ensures comparable talents motivation face roughly similar life chances inequalities society work benefit least advantaged
rawls held principles justice apply basic structure fundamental social institutions judiciary economic structure political constitution qualification source controversy constructive debate work gerald cohen
rawls argued principles lexically ordered award priority basic liberties equalityoriented demands second principle also topic much debate among moral political philosophers
finally rawls took approach applying first instance called wellordered society designed advance good members effectively regulated public conception justice29 respect understood justice fairness contribution ideal theory determination principles characterize wellordered society favorable circumstances30 much recent work political philosophy asked justice fairness might dictate indeed whether useful problems partial compliance nonideal theorycitation needed
political liberalismedit
political liberalism 1993 rawls turned towards question political legitimacy context intractable philosophical religious moral disagreement amongst citizens regarding human good disagreement insisted reasonable result free exercise human rationality conditions open enquiry free conscience liberal state designed safeguard question legitimacy face reasonable disagreement urgent rawls justification justice fairness relied upon kantian conception human good reasonably rejected political conception offered theory justice shown good invoking controversial conception human flourishing unclear liberal state ordered according could possibly legitimate
intuition animating seemingly concern actually different guiding idea theory justice namely fundamental charter society must rely principles arguments reasons cannot reasonably rejected citizens whose lives limited social legal political circumscriptions words legitimacy contingent upon justification impossible reasonably reject insight took shape however rawls realized application must extend deep justification justice fairness presented terms reasonably rejectable kantian conception human flourishing free development autonomous moral agency
core political liberalism accordingly insistence order retain legitimacy liberal state must commit ideal public reason roughly means citizens public capacity must engage another terms reasons whose status reasons shared political reasoning proceed purely terms public reasons example supreme court justice deliberating whether denial homosexuals ability marry constitutes violation 14th amendments equal protection clause advert religious convictions matter take account argument samesex household provides suboptimal conditions childs development reasons based upon interpretation sacred text nonpublic force reasons relies upon faith commitments reasonably rejected whereas reasons rely upon value providing children environments develop optimally public reasons status reasons draws upon deep controversial conception human flourishing
rawls held duty civility duty citizens offer another reasons mutually understood reasons applies within called public political forum forum extends upper reaches government example supreme legislative judicial bodies society deliberations citizen deciding vote state legislatures vote public referenda campaigning politicians also believed refrain pandering nonpublic religious moral convictions constituencies
ideal public reason secures dominance public political values freedom equality fairness serve foundation liberal state justification values since justification would necessarily draw upon deep religious moral metaphysical commitments would reasonably rejectable rawls held public political values justified privately individual citizens public liberal political conception attendant values affirmed publicly judicial opinions presidential addresses example deep justifications task justification falls rawls called reasonable comprehensive doctrines citizens subscribe reasonable catholic justify liberal values reasonable muslim another reasonable secular citizen another illustrate rawlss idea using venn diagram public political values shared space upon overlap numerous reasonable comprehensive doctrines rawlss account stability presented theory justice detailed portrait compatibility kantian comprehensive doctrine justice fairness hope similar accounts presented many comprehensive doctrines rawlss famous notion overlapping consensus
consensus would necessarily exclude doctrines namely unreasonable wonder rawls doctrines unreasonable comprehensive doctrine unreasonable sense incompatible duty civility simply another saying unreasonable doctrine incompatible fundamental political values liberal theory justice designed safeguard freedom equality fairness answer question rawls doctrines nothing thing liberal state cannot justify individuals religious fundamentalists hold doctrines justification would noted proceed terms controversial moral religious commitments excluded public political forum importantly goal rawlsian project primarily determine whether liberal conception political legitimacy internally coherent project carried specification sorts reasons persons committed liberal values permitted dialogue deliberations arguments another political matters rawlsian project goal exclusion concern justifying liberal values already committed least open rawlss concern whether idea political legitimacy fleshed terms duty civility mutual justification serve viable form public discourse face religious moral pluralism modern democratic society justifying conception political legitimacy first place
rawls also modified principles justice follows first principle priority second first half second priority latter half

person equal claim fully adequate scheme basic rights liberties scheme compatible scheme scheme equal political liberties liberties guaranteed fair value
social economic inequalities satisfy conditions first attached positions offices open conditions fair equality opportunity second greatest benefit least advantaged members society

principles subtly modified principles theory first principle reads equal claim instead equal right also replaces phrase system basic liberties fully adequate scheme equal basic rights liberties parts second principle also switched difference principle becomes latter three
peoplesedit
main article peoples
although passing comments international affairs theory justice wasnt late career rawls formulated comprehensive theory international politics publication peoples claimed wellordered peoples could either liberal decent rawls argued legitimacy liberal international order contingent tolerating decent peoples differ liberal peoples among ways might state religions deny adherents minority faiths right hold positions power within state might organize political participation consultation hierarchies rather elections however wellordered peoples violate human rights behave externally aggressive manner peoples fail meet criteria liberal decent peoples referred outlaw states societies burdened unfavourable conditions benevolent absolutisms depending particular failings peoples right mutual respect toleration possessed liberal decent peoples
rawlss views global distributive justice expressed work surprised many fellow egalitarian liberals example charles beitz previously written study argued application rawlss difference principles globally rawls denied principles applied partly grounds states unlike citizens selfsufficient cooperative enterprises constitute domestic societies although rawls recognized given governments unable protect human rights economic reasons claimed purpose achieve eventual state global equality rather ensure societies could maintain liberal decent political institutions argued among things continuing give indefinitely would nations industrious populations subsidize idle populations would create moral hazard problem governments could spend irresponsibly knowledge bailed nations spent responsibly
rawlss discussion nonideal theory hand included condemnation bombing civilians american bombing german japanese cities world well discussions immigration nuclear proliferation also detailed ideal statesman political leader looks next generation promotes international harmony even face significant domestic pressure otherwise rawls also controversially claimed violations human rights legitimize military intervention violating states though also expressed hope societies could induced reform peacefully good example liberal decent peoples
