although modern standard arabic unitary language pronunciation varies somewhat country country region region within country variation individual accents speakers tends mirror corresponding variations colloquial speech speakers question distinguishing characteristics moderated somewhat note important descriptions arabic phonology distinguish pronunciation given colloquial spoken dialect pronunciation speakers although related example phoneme derives protosemitic many different pronunciations modern spoken varieties speakers whose native variety either pronunciation speaking even speakers cairo whose native egyptian arabic normally speaking persian gulf speakers variant pronunciation isnt found d͡ʒʒ used instead
another example many colloquial varieties known type vowel harmony presence emphatic consonant triggers backed allophones nearby vowels especially vowels backed circumstances often fronted circumstances many spoken varieties backed emphatic vowel allophones spread fair distance directions triggering consonant varieties notably egyptian arabic emphatic allophones spread throughout entire word usually including prefixes suffixes even distance several syllables triggering consonant speakers colloquial varieties vowel harmony tend introduce pronunciation well usually lesser degree spreading colloquial varieties example speakers colloquial varieties extremely longdistance harmony allow moderate extreme amount spreading harmonic allophones speech speakers colloquial varieties moderatedistance harmony harmonize immediately adjacent vowels
vowels

informal short pronunciation
pronunciation used speakers modern standard arabic extemporaneous speech producing sentences rather simply reading prepared text similar formal short pronunciation except rules dropping final vowels apply even clitic suffix added basically shortvowel case mood endings never pronounced certain changes occur echo corresponding colloquial pronunciations specifically

rules formal short pronunciation apply except follows
past tense singular endings written formally pronounced masculine ʾanta pronounced full
unlike formal short pronunciation rules dropping modifying final endings also applied clitic object possessive suffix added usour produces sequence three consonants following happens depending speakers native colloquial variety

short vowel consistently added either second third first second consonants
short vowel added otherwise unpronounceable sequence occurs typically violation sonority hierarchy pronounced threeconsonant cluster needs broken
short vowel never added consonants like occurring consonants pronounced syllabic consonant english words butter bottle bottom button
doubled consonant occurs another consonant finally often shortened single consonant rather vowel added note moroccan arabic never shortens doubled consonants inserts short vowels break clusters instead tolerating arbitrarylength series arbitrary consonants hence moroccan arabic speakers likely follow rules pronunciation modern standard arabic


clitic suffixes tend also changed avoids many possible occurrences threeconsonant clusters particular generally sound
final long vowels often shortened merging short vowels remain
depending level formality speakers education level various grammatical changes occur ways echo colloquial variants

remaining case endings masculine plural nominative oblique leveled oblique form used everywhere however words like father brother special longvowel case endings construct state nominative used everywhere hence father akhū brother

mentioned many spoken dialects process emphasis spreading emphasis pharyngealization emphatic consonants spreads forward back adjacent syllables pharyngealizing nearby consonants triggering back allophone nearby vowels extent emphasis spreading varies example moroccan arabic spreads first full vowel sound derived long vowel diphthong either side many levantine dialects spreads indefinitely blocked egyptian arabic usually spreads throughout entire word including prefixes suffixes moroccan arabic also emphatic allophones respectively
unstressed short vowels especially deleted many contexts many sporadic examples short vowel change occurred especially interchange levantine dialects merge short contexts except directly single final consonant moroccan arabic hand short triggers labialization nearby consonants especially velar consonants uvular consonants short merge deleted many contexts labialization plus sometimes interpreted underlying phoneme essentially causes wholesale loss shortlong vowel distinction original long vowels remaining halflong phonemically used represent short long vowels borrowings literary arabic
