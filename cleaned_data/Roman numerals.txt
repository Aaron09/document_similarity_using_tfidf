roman numeric system
basic decimal pattern
original pattern roman numerals used symbols simple tally marks marker added unit value added make numbers

iiii viii viiii

numerals iiii viiii proved problematic among things easily confused viii generally replaced less less feature roman numerals called subtractive notation
numbers including subtractive notation expressed roman numerals follows

viii

system basically decimal tens hundreds follow pattern
thus counting tens taking place taking place taking place

lxxx

note follow subtractive pattern
similarly 1000 counting hundreds

dccc

many numbers include hundreds units tens roman numeral system basically decimal place added separately descending sequence left right arabic numbers example number xxxix three tens less ccxlvi hundreds fifty less five place notation need place keeping zeros missing places simply omitted thus instance written ccvii hundreds five ones 1066 becomes mlxvi thousand fifty five one34
roman numerals large numbers nowadays seen mainly form year numbers uses detailed later article examples

history
preroman times ancient rome
although roman numerals came written letters roman alphabet originally independent symbols etruscans example used happened letters alphabet
hypotheses origin roman numerals
tally marks
hypothesis etruscoroman numerals actually derive notches tally sticks continued used italian dalmatian shepherds 19th century14
thus descends letter notch scored across stick every fifth notch double every tenth cross iiiiλiiiixiiiiλiiiixii much like european tally marks today produced positional system eight counting stick eight tallies iiiiλiii eighth longer series tallies either could abbreviated λiii viii existence implies four prior notches extension eighteen eighth tally first could abbreviated xλiii likewise number four stick inotch could felt could written either iiii thus system neither additive subtractive conception ordinal tallies transferred writing marks easily identified existing roman letters
tenth along stick received extra stroke thus written variously perhaps often chickentrack shape like superimposed flattened inverted time augustus soon thereafter became identified graphically similar letter likewise variously symbols plus extra stroke form superimposed like came predominate written variously abbreviated variant finally winning letter stood centum latin hundred
hundredth marked circle thus like superimposed becoming time augustus graphic influence letter later identified letter alternative symbol thousand half thousand five hundred right half symbol converted ⟨d⟩15 least etymology given later
meanwhile 1000 circled boxed augustinian times partially identified greek letter time symbol changed latter symbol evolved eventually changed influence latin word mille thousand
hand signals
alfred hooper alternative hypothesis origin roman numeral system small numbers16 hooper contends digits related hand gestures counting example numbers iiii correspond number fingers held another represents hand upright fingers together thumb apart numbers 6–10 represented hands follows left hand right hand 7vii 8viii 9viiii 10vv results either crossing thumbs holding hands cross
another possibility represents finger represents thumb hand numbers 1–10 counted hand using order iipr iiiprm ivit vitp viitpr viiitprm ixin ppinky rring mmiddle iindex tthumb fingersother hand pattern also continued using hand fingers representing thumb
intermediate symbols deriving original symbols
third hypothesis origins states basic ciphers intermediary ones derived taking half half half half later replaced initial mille latin word thousand
middle ages renaissance
minuscule lowercase letters developed middle ages well demise western roman empire since time lowercase versions roman numbers also commonly used
since middle ages sometimes substituted final lowercase roman numeral considered swash variant example final still used medical prescriptions prevent tampering misinterpretation number written1819
numerals documents inscriptions middle ages sometimes include additional symbols today called medieval roman numerals simply substitute another letter standard others serve abbreviations compound numerals although still listed today dictionaries long use20
