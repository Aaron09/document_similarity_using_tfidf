overview softwareedit
starting around 1970s computer aided design systems began provide capability ability reproduce manual drafting electronic drafting cost benefit companies switch became apparent benefits systems manual drafting capabilities often takes granted computer systems today automated generation bill material auto layout integrated circuits interference checking many others eventually provided designer ability perform engineering calculations transition calculations still performed either hand individuals could computer programs revolutionary change engineering industry draftsmen designers engineering roles begin merge eliminate departments much merged departments empowered draftsman designers engineers another example pervasive effect computers beginning industry current computeraided design software packages range vectorbased drafting systems solid surface modelers modern packages also frequently allow rotations three dimensions allowing viewing designed object desired angle even inside looking software capable dynamic mathematical modeling
technology used design tools machinery drafting design types buildings small residential types houses largest commercial industrial structures hospitals factories8
mainly used detailed engineering models drawings physical components also used throughout engineering process conceptual design layout products strength dynamic analysis assemblies definition manufacturing methods components also used design objects jewelry furniture appliances furthermore many applications offer advanced rendering animation capabilities engineers better visualize product designs type virtual construction engineering simulation incorporating time schedule related information project management
become especially important technology within scope computeraided technologies benefits lower product development costs greatly shortened design cycle enables designers layout develop work screen print save future editing saving time drawings
usesedit
computeraided design many tools used engineers designers used many ways depending profession user type software question
part whole digital product development activity within product lifecycle management processes used together tools either integrated modules standalone products

computeraided engineering finite element analysis
computeraided manufacturing including instructions computer numerical control machines
photorealistic rendering motion simulation
document management revision control using product data management

also used accurate creation photo simulations often required preparation environmental impact reports computeraided designs intended buildings superimposed photographs existing environments represent locale like proposed facilities allowed built potential blockage view corridors shadow studies also frequently analyzed
proven useful engineers well using four properties history features parameterization high level constraints construction history used look back models personal features work single area rather whole model parameters constraints used determine size shape properties different modeling elements features system used variety tools measurement tensile strength yield strength electrical electromagnetic properties also stress strain timing element gets affected certain temperatures

simple procedure


also comparison computeraided design editors
several different types cad9 requiring operator think differently design virtual components different manner
many producers lowerend systems including number free open source programs provide approach drawing process without fuss scale placement drawing sheet accompanied hand drafting since adjusted required creation final draft
wireframe basically extension drafting often used today line manually inserted drawing final product mass properties associated cannot features directly added holes operator approaches similar fashion systems although many systems allow using wireframe model make final engineering drawing views
dumb solids created analogous manipulations real world objects often used today basic threedimensional geometric forms prisms cylinders spheres solid volumes added subtracted assembling cutting realworld objects twodimensional projected views easily generated models basic solids dont usually include tools easily allow motion components limits motion identify interference components
types solid modeling

parametric modeling allows operator referred design intent objects features created modifiable future modifications made changing original part created feature intended located center part operator locate center model feature could located using geometric object already available part random placement would defeat design intent operator designs part functions parametric modeler able make changes part maintaining geometric functional relationships
direct explicit modeling provide ability edit geometry without history tree direct modeling sketch used create geometry sketch incorporated geometry designer modifies geometry without needing original sketch parametric modeling direct modeling ability include relationships selected geometry tangency concentricity

systems offer capabilities incorporate organic aesthetics ergonomic features designs freeform surface modeling often combined solids allow designer create products human form visual requirements well interface machine
