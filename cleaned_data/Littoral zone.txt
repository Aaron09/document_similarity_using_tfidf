littoral zone part lake river close shore coastal environments littoral zone extends high water mark rarely inundated shoreline areas permanently submerged always includes intertidal zone often used mean intertidal zone however meaning littoral zone extend well beyond intertidal zone
single definition regarded full extent littoral zone littoral zone divided subregions varies different contexts lakes rivers definitions term also varies part world another different disciplines example military commanders speak littoral ways quite different marine biologists
adjacency water gives number distinctive characteristics littoral regions erosive power water results particular types landforms sand dunes estuaries natural movement littoral along coast called littoral drift biologically ready availability water enables greater variety plant animal life particularly formation extensive wetlands addition additional local humidity evaporation usually creates microclimate supporting unique types organisms
word littoral used noun adjective derives latin noun litus litoris meaning shore doubled late medieval innovation word sometimes seen classicallooking spelling litoral

oceanography marine biology idea littoral zone extended roughly edge continental shelf starting shoreline littoral zone begins spray region high tide mark moves intertidal region high water marks edge continental shelf three subregions called order supralittoral zone eulittoral zone sublittoral zone
supralittoral zoneedit
main article supralittoral zone
supralittoral zone also called splash spray supratidal zone area spring high tide line regularly splashed submerged ocean water seawater penetrates elevated areas storms high tides organisms must cope also exposure fresh water rain cold heat predation land animals seabirds area patches dark lichens appear crusts rocks types periwinkles neritidae detritus feeding isopoda commonly inhabit lower supralittoral1
eulittoral zoneedit
also intertidal zone
eulittoral zone also called midlittoral mediolittoral zone intertidal zone also known foreshore extends spring high tide line rarely inundated spring tide line rarely inundated wave action turbulence recurring tides shapes reforms cliffs gaps caves offering huge range habitats sedentary organisms protected rocky shorelines usually show narrow almost homogenous eulittoral strip often marked presence barnacles exposed sites show wider extension often divided zones intertidal ecology
sublittoral zoneedit
also neritic zone
sublittoral zone starts immediately eulittoral zone zone permanently covered seawater approximately equivalent neritic zone
physical oceanography sublittoral zone refers coastal regions significant tidal flows energy dissipation including nonlinear flows internal waves river outflows oceanic fronts practice typically extends edge continental shelf depths around meters
marine biology sublittoral refers areas sunlight reaches ocean floor water never deep take photic zone results high primary production makes sublittoral zone location majority life physical oceanography zone typically extends edge continental shelf benthic zone sublittoral much stable intertidal zone temperature water pressure amount sunlight remain fairly constant sublittoral corals deal much change intertidal corals corals live zones common sublittoral zone
within sublittoral marine biologists also identify following

infralittoral zone algal dominated zone maybe five metres water mark
circalittoral zone region beyond infralittoral algal zone dominated sessile animals oysters

shallower regions sublittoral zone extending shore sometimes referred subtidal zone

freshwater ecosystemsedit




shoreline lake nearly unvegetated littoral zone


freshwater situations littoral zones occur edge large lakes rivers often extensive areas wetland hence sometimes referred fringing wetlands effects tides minimal definitions littoral used example minnesota department natural resources defines littoral portion lake less feet depth2
littoral zone form narrow broad fringing wetland extensive areas aquatic plants sorted tolerance different water depths typically four zones recognized higher lower shore wooded wetland meadow marsh aquatic vegetation3 relative areas four types depends profile shoreline upon past water levels area meadow particularly dependent upon past water levels4 general area meadows along lakes rivers increases natural water level fluctuations56 many animals lakes rivers dependent upon wetlands littoral zones since rooted plants provide habitat food hence large productive littoral zone considered important characteristic healthy lake river4
littoral zones particular risk reasons first human settlement often attracted shorelines settlement often disrupts breeding habitats littoral zone species example many turtles killed roads leave water eggs upland sites fish negatively affected docks retaining walls remove breeding habitat shallow water shoreline communities even deliberately remove wetlands since interfere activities like swimming overall presence human settlement demonstrated negative impact upon adjoining wetlands7 equally serious problem tendency stabilize lake river levels dams dams removed spring flood carries nutrients littoral zones reduces natural fluctuation water levels upon many wetland plants animals depend89 hence time dams reduce area wetland broad littoral zone narrow band vegetation marshes meadows particular risk
