physical chemical propertiesedit




crystallized honey inset shows closeup honey showing individual glucose grains fructose mixture


physical properties honey vary depending water content type flora used produce pasturage temperature proportion specific sugars contains fresh honey supersaturated liquid containing sugar water typically dissolve ambient temperatures room temperature honey supercooled liquid glucose precipitate solid granules forms semisolid solution precipitated glucose crystals solution fructose ingredients
temperature density honey typically ranges kgl35
phase transitionsedit
melting point crystallized honey depending composition temperature honey either metastable state meaning crystallize seed crystal added often labile state saturated enough sugars crystallize spontaneously36 rate crystallization affected many factors primary factor ratio main sugars fructose glucose honeys supersaturated high percentage glucose brassica honey crystallize almost immediately harvesting honeys percentage glucose chestnut tupelo honey crystallize types honey produce large crystals others produce many small crystals37
crystallization also affected water content high percentage water inhibits crystallization high dextrin content temperature also affects rate crystallization fastest growth occurring crystal nuclei seeds tend form readily honey disturbed stirring shaking agitating rather left rest however nucleation microscopic seedcrystals greatest therefore larger fewer crystals tend form higher temperatures smaller morenumerous crystals usually form lower temperatures honey crystallize thus original texture flavor preserved indefinitely37
since honey normally exists melting point supercooled liquid temperatures honey freeze solid instead temperatures become lower viscosity honey increases like viscous liquids honey becomes thick sluggish decreasing temperature honey appear even feel solid continues flow rates honey glass transition temperature honey enters glassy state becomes amorphous solid noncrystalline3839
viscosityedit




pouring honey sheetlike appearance flow result high viscosity surface tension contributing stickiness honey


viscosity honey affected greatly temperature water content higher water percentage easily honey flows melting point however water little effect viscosity aside water content composition honey also little effect viscosity exception types honey water content generally viscosity around poise honey containing water viscosity around poise viscosity increase temperature occurs slowly first honey containing water viscosity around poise viscosity around poise cooling progresses honey becomes viscous increasingly rapid rate reaching poise around however honey viscous rather surface tension4041
types honey unusual viscous properties honeys heather manuka display thixotropic properties types honey enter gellike state motionless liquify stirred42
electrical optical propertiesedit
honey contains electrolytes form acids minerals exhibits varying degrees electrical conductivity measurements electrical conductivity used determine quality honey terms content41
effect honey light useful determining type quality variations water content alter refractive index honey water content easily measured refractometer typically refractive index honey ranges 1504 water content 1474 honey also effect polarized light rotates polarization plane fructose gives negative rotation glucose gives positive overall rotation used measure ratio mixture4143 honey vary color pale yellow dark brown bright colors occasionally found depending source sugar harvested bees44
hygroscopy fermentationedit
honey ability absorb moisture directly phenomenon called hygroscopy amount water honey absorbs dependent relative humidity honey contains yeast hygroscopic nature requires honey stored sealed containers prevent fermentation usually begins honeys water content rises much honey tends absorb water manner individual sugars allow ingredients contains43
fermentation honey usually occurs crystallization without glucose liquid portion honey primarily consists concentrated mixture fructose acids water providing yeast enough increase water percentage growth honey stored room temperature long periods time often pasteurized kill yeast heating °f43
thermal characteristicsedit




creamed honey left appears fresh honey right aged room temperature years still edible maillard reaction produces considerable differences color flavor aged honey


like sugar compounds honey caramelizes heated sufficiently becoming darker color eventually burns however honey contains fructose caramelizes lower temperatures glucose45 temperature caramelization begins varies depending composition typically honey also contains acids catalysts caramelization specific types acids amounts play primary role determining exact temperature46 acids amino acids occur small amounts play important role darkening honey amino acids form darkened compounds called melanoidins maillard reaction maillard reaction occurs slowly room temperature taking several months show visible darkening speeds dramatically increasing temperatures however reaction also slowed storing honey colder temperatures47
unlike many liquids honey poor thermal conductivity taking long time reach thermal equilibrium melting crystallized honey easily result localized caramelization heat source evenly distributed however honey takes substantially longer liquify melting point elevated temperatures41 melting crystallized honey take hours take twice long times nearly half heating however many minor substances honey affected greatly heating changing flavor aroma properties heating usually done lowest temperature possible shortest amount time48
acid content flavor effectsedit
average honey range 6149 honey contains many kinds acids organic amino however different types amounts vary considerably depending type honey acids aromatic aliphatic nonaromatic aliphatic acids contribute greatly flavor honey interacting flavors ingredients49
organic acids comprise acids honey accounting 017–117 mixture gluconic acid formed actions enzyme called glucose oxidase prevalent49 organic acids minor consisting formic acetic butyric citric lactic malic pyroglutamic propionic valeric capronic palmitic succinic among many others4950
