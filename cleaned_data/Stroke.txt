main types hemorrhagic stroke2526

intracerebral hemorrhage basically bleeding within brain artery brain bursts flooding surrounding tissue blood either intraparenchymal hemorrhage bleeding within brain tissue intraventricular hemorrhage bleeding within brains ventricular system
subarachnoid hemorrhage basically bleeding occurs outside brain tissue still within skull precisely arachnoid mater mater delicate innermost layer three layers meninges surround brain

main types hemorrhagic stroke also different forms intracranial hemorrhage accumulation blood anywhere within cranial vault forms intracranial hemorrhage epidural hematoma bleeding skull dura mater thick outermost layer meninges surround brain subdural hematoma bleeding subdural space considered hemorrhagic strokes27
hemorrhagic strokes occur background alterations blood vessels brain cerebral amyloid angiopathy cerebral arteriovenous malformation intracranial aneurysm cause intraparenchymal subarachnoid hemorrhagecitation needed
addition neurological impairment hemorrhagic strokes usually cause specific symptoms instance subarachnoid hemorrhage classically causes severe headache known thunderclap headache reveal evidence previous head injury
signs symptoms
stroke symptoms typically start suddenly seconds minutes cases progress symptoms depend area brain affected extensive area brain affected functions likely lost forms stroke cause additional symptoms example intracranial hemorrhage affected area compress structures forms stroke associated headache apart subarachnoid hemorrhage cerebral venous thrombosis occasionally intracerebral hemorrhagecitation needed
early recognition
