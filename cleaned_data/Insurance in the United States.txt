historically insurance industry united states regulated almost exclusively individual state governments first state commissioner insurance appointed hampshire 1851 statebased insurance regulatory system grew quickly insurance industry itself9 prior period insurance primarily regulated corporate charter state statutory facto regulation courts judicial decisions1011
statebased insurance regulation system state operates independently regulate insurance markets typically state department insurance division insurance stretching back paul virginia case 1869 challenges statebased insurance regulatory system risen various groups within without insurance industry state regulatory system described cumbersome redundant confusing costly12
united states supreme court found 1944 case united states southeastern underwriters association business insurance subject federal regulation commerce clause constitution13 united states congress however responded almost immediately mccarranferguson 194514 mccarranferguson specifically provides regulation business insurance state governments public interest states federal construed invalidate impair supersede enacted state government purpose regulating business insurance unless federal specifically relates business insurance15
wave insurance company insolvencies 1980s sparked renewed interest federal insurance regulation including legislation dual state federal system insurance solvency regulation16 response national association insurance commissioners naic adopted several model reforms state insurance regulation including riskbased capital requirements financial regulation accreditation standards initiative codify accounting principles states enacted versions model reforms pressure federal reform insurance regulation waned17 however still significant differences states systems insurance regulation cost compliance systems ultimately borne insureds form higher premiums mckinsey company estimated 2009 insurance industry incurs billion annually unnecessary regulatory costs statebased regulatory system18
naic acts forum creation model laws regulations state decides whether pass naic model regulation state make changes enactment process models widely albeit somewhat irregularly adopted naic also acts national level advance laws policies supported state insurance regulators naic model acts regulations provide degree uniformity states models force effect unless adopted state however used guides states states adopt little change19
longrunning debate within among states importance government regulation insurance noticeable different titles state insurance regulatory agencies many states insurance regulated cabinetlevel department economic importance states insurance regulated division larger department business regulation financial services grounds elevating many government agencies departments leads administrative chaos better option maintain clear chain command

organizationedit
admitted surplusedit
important artifact statebased insurance regulation system united states dichotomy admitted surplus insurers insurers admitted meaning formally admitted states insurance market state insurance commissioner subject various state laws governing organization capitalization policy forms rate approvals claims handling surplus meaning nonadmitted particular state willing write coverage surplus line insurers supposed underwrite unusual difficulttoinsure risks prevent undermining states ability regulate insurance market although experienced insurance brokers well aware risks admitted insurer accept must document diligent effort actually shopping around risk several admitted insurers typically three promptly reject applying coverage surplus line insurer24
relieve insurers brokers tedious timeconsuming chore many states maintain export lists risks state insurance commissioner already identified coverage available whatsoever admitted insurer state turn brokers presented clients risks immediately export outofstate surplus market apply directly surplus line insurers without first document multiple attempts present risk admitted insurers24 however many states refused establish export lists including florida illinois texas
nature export lists illustrate insurers consider hardtoinsure risks example california export list includes ambulance services amusement parks fireworks displays moving building demolition balloons product recalls sawmills security guards tattoo shops well particular types insurance like employment practices liability kidnap ransom25
although surplus line insurers still regulated states countries actually admitted disadvantages obtaining insurance surplus line insurer policy usually written nonstandard form insurance services office insurer collapses insureds states nonadmitted enjoy certain types protection available insureds states countries insurer admitted however persons trying obtain coverage unusual risks choice usually surplus line insurer coverage
longrunning issue surplus lines concept makes less sense applied sophisticated insureds many risks spread across multiple states congress enacted nonadmitted reinsurance reform 2010 attempt clarify state gets regulate sale surplus lines insurance insureds exempt certain elite categories insurance purchasers normal requirement diligent effort procure coverage admitted insurers
insurance groupsedit
smallest insurers exist single corporation major insurance companies actually exist insurance groups consist holding companies several admitted surplus insurers sometimes excess insurers reinsurers well dramatic variations insurance group next terms various business functions divided among subsidiaries outsourced third party corporations altogether major insurance groups transact insurance california maintain publicly accessible list sites actual insurer entities within group required california insurance code section
example insurance groups work people call geico rate quote actually speaking geico insurance agency write policy geicos seven insurance companies customer writes check premium geico premium actually deposited seven insurance companies actually wrote policy similarly claims policy charged issuing company layperson customers know simply dealing geico
obviously difficult operate insurance group single insurance company since employees must painstakingly trained observe corporate formalities courts treat entities group alter egos example insurance policies claimrelated documents must consistently reference relevant company within group flows premiums claim payments must carefully recorded books correct company
advantage insurance group system group increased survivability long single insurance company company group many claims fails company quietly placed runoff continues exist process remaining claims longer writes coverage rest group continues operate
contrast small insurers fail tend rather wild spectacular fashion often case economic cycles 1970s 1980s sometimes result statesupervised takeover state agency assume part residual liabilities
