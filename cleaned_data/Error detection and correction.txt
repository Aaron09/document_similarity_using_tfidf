introductionedit
general idea achieving error detection correction redundancy extra data message receivers check consistency delivered message recover data determined corrupted errordetection correction schemes either systematic nonsystematic systematic scheme transmitter sends original data attaches fixed number check bits parity data derived data bits deterministic algorithm error detection required receiver simply apply algorithm received data bits compare output received check bits values match error occurred point transmission system uses nonsystematic code original message transformed encoded message least many bits original message

implementationedit
error correction generally realized different ways

automatic repeat request sometimes also referred backward error correction error control technique whereby error detection scheme combined requests retransmission erroneous data every block data received checked using error detection code used check fails retransmission data requested done repeatedly data verified
forward error correction sender encodes data using errorcorrecting code prior transmission additional information redundancy added code used receiver recover original data general reconstructed data deemed likely original data

combined minor errors corrected without retransmission major errors corrected request retransmission called hybrid automatic repeatrequest harq
