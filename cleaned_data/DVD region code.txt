implementations region codesedit
standalone playersedit
usually configuration flag players firmware factory flag holds region number machine allowed play regionfree players players shipped without ability enforce regional lockout usually means chip ignores region coding without flag
however player regionfree often unlocked unlock code entered remote control code simply allows user change factoryset configuration flag another region special region unlocked player allows owner watch dvds region many websites exist internet offering codes often known informally hacks many websites provide instructions different models standalone players hack factory codes
computer drivesedit
older drives rpc1 regional playback control firmware means drive allows dvds region play newer drives rpc2 firmware enforces region coding hardware level drives often reflashed hacked rpc1 firmware effectively making drive regionfree void drive warranty9
drives come regionfree user expected assign region case programs prompt user select region others actually assign region automatically based locale operating system
computer drives users allowed change region code five times10 number allowances reaches zero region last used permanent even drive transferred another computer limit built drives controller software called firmware resetting firmware count done first thirdparty software tools reflashing rpc1 firmware
since software work correctly rpc1 drives also option reflashing drive socalled autoreset firmware firmware appears rpc2 firmware software reset region changes counter whenever power cycled reverting state drive never region code changed
