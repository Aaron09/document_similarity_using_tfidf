modern aviation began first untethered human lighterthanair flight november 1783 balloon designed montgolfier brothers practicality balloons limited could travel downwind immediately recognized steerable dirigible balloon required jeanpierre blanchard flew first humanpowered dirigible 1784 crossed english channel 1785
rigid airships became first aircraft transport passengers cargo great distances best known aircraft type manufactured german zeppelin company
successful zeppelin graf zeppelin flew million miles including aroundtheworld flight august 1929 however dominance zeppelins airplanes period range hundred miles diminishing airplane design advanced golden airships ended 1937 hindenburg caught fire killing people cause hindenburg accident initially blamed hydrogen instead helium lift internal investigation manufacturer revealed coating used material covering frame highly flammable allowed static electricity build airship5 changes coating formulation reduced risk hindenburg type accidents although periodic initiatives revive airships seen niche application since time

aircraft began transport people cargo designs grew larger reliable wright brothers took aloft first passenger charles furnas mechanics 19081314
1920s 1930s great progress made field aviation including first transatlantic flight alcock brown 1919 charles lindberghs solo transatlantic flight 1927 charles kingsford smiths transpacific flight following year successful designs period douglas became first airliner profitable carrying passengers exclusively starting modern passenger airline service beginning world many towns cities built airports numerous qualified pilots available brought many innovations aviation including first aircraft first liquidfueled rockets

world especially north america boom general aviation private commercial thousands pilots released military service many inexpensive warsurplus transport training aircraft became available manufacturers cessna piper beechcraft expanded production provide light aircraft middleclass market
1950s development civil jets grew beginning havilland comet though first widely used passenger boeing much economical aircraft time time turboprop propulsion began appear smaller commuter planes making possible serve smallvolume routes much wider range weather conditions
since 1960s composite material airframes quieter efficient engines become available concorde provided supersonic passenger service decades important lasting innovations taken place instrumentation control arrival solidstate electronics global positioning system satellite communications increasingly small powerful computers displays dramatically changed cockpits airliners increasingly smaller aircraft well pilots navigate much accurately view terrain obstructions nearby aircraft synthetic vision even night visibility

1947 cessna


general aviation includes nonscheduled civil flying private commercial general aviation include business flights charter private aviation flight training ballooning parachuting gliding hang gliding aerial photography footlaunched powered hang gliders ambulance crop dusting charter flights traffic reporting police patrols forest fire fighting
country regulates aviation differently general aviation usually falls different regulations depending whether private commercial type equipment involved
many small aircraft manufacturers serve general aviation market focus private aviation flight training
important recent developments small aircraft form bulk fleet introduction advanced avionics including formerly found large airliners introduction composite materials make small aircraft lighter faster ultralight homebuilt aircraft also become increasingly popular recreational since countries allow private aviation much less expensive less heavily regulated certified aircraft

usaf thunderbird pilot ejecting aircraft airshow 2003


aviation accident defined convention international civil aviation annex occurrence associated operation aircraft takes place time person boards aircraft intention flight time persons disembarked person fatally seriously injured aircraft sustains damage structural failure aircraft missing completely inaccessible16
first fatal aviation accident occurred wright model aircraft fort myer virginia september 1908 resulting injury pilot orville wright death passenger signal corps lieutenant thomas selfridge17
aviation incident defined occurrence accident associated operation aircraft affects could affect safety operations18
accident damage aircraft must written plane destroyed called hull loss accident18
traffic controledit
main article traffic control




traffic control towers amsterdam airport


traffic control involves communication aircraft help maintain separation ensure aircraft sufficiently enough apart horizontally vertically risk collision controllers coordinate position reports provided pilots high traffic areas united states radar aircraft positions
generally four different types

center controllers control aircraft route airports
control towers including tower ground control clearance delivery services control aircraft within small distance typically 10–15 horizontal 1000 vertical airport
oceanic controllers control aircraft international waters continents generally without radar service
terminal controllers control aircraft wider area typically 50–80 around busy airports

especially important aircraft flying instrument flight rules weather conditions allow pilots aircraft however hightraffic areas especially near major airports aircraft flying visual flight rules also required follow instructions
addition separation aircraft provide weather advisories terrain separation navigation assistance services pilots depending workload
control flights majority flights north america required contact unless passing busy terminal area using major airport many areas northern canada altitude northern scotland traffic control services available even flights lower altitudes
environmental impactedit
main article environmental impact aviation
like activities involving combustion operating powered aircraft airliners balloons releases soot pollutants atmosphere greenhouse gases carbon dioxide also produced addition environmental impacts specific aviation instance




water vapor contrails left highaltitude airliners contribute cirrus cloud formation



aircraft operating high altitudes near tropopause mainly large airliners emit aerosols leave contrails increase cirrus cloud formation cloud cover increased since birth aviation19
aircraft operating high altitudes near tropopause also release chemicals interact greenhouse gases altitudes particularly nitrogen compounds interact ozone increasing ozone concentrations2021
light piston aircraft burn avgas contains tetraethyllead lowercompression piston engines operate unleaded mogas turbine engines diesel engines neither require lead appearing newer light aircraft

another environmental impact aviation noise pollution mainly caused aircraft taking landing
