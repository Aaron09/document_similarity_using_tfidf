environmental science interdisciplinary academic field integrates physical biological information sciences including ecology biology physics chemistry plant science zoology mineralogy oceanology limnology soil science geology atmospheric science geodesy study environment solution environmental problems environmental science emerged fields natural history medicine enlightenment1 today provides integrated quantitative interdisciplinary approach study environmental systems2 glossary environmental science
related areas study include environmental studies environmental engineering environmental studies incorporates social sciences understanding human relationships perceptions policies towards environment environmental engineering focuses design technology improving environmental quality every aspect
environmental scientists work subjects like understanding earth processes evaluating alternative energy systems pollution control mitigation natural resource management effects global climate change environmental issues almost always include interaction physical chemical biological processes environmental scientists bring systems approach analysis environmental problems elements effective environmental scientist include ability relate space time relationships well quantitative analysis
environmental science came alive substantive active field scientific investigation 1960s 1970s driven need multidisciplinary approach analyze complex environmental problems arrival substantive environmental laws requiring specific environmental protocols investigation growing public awareness need action addressing environmental problems events spurred development included publication rachel carsons landmark environmental book silent spring3 along major environmental issues becoming public 1969 santa barbara spill cuyahoga river cleveland ohio catching fire also 1969 helped increase visibility environmental issues create field study

atmospheric sciencesedit
main article atmospheric sciences
atmospheric sciences focus earths atmosphere emphasis upon interrelation systems atmospheric sciences include studies meteorology greenhouse phenomena atmospheric dispersion modeling airborne contaminants56 sound propagation phenomena related noise pollution even light pollution
taking example global warming phenomena physicists create computer models atmospheric circulation infrared radiation transmission chemists examine inventory atmospheric chemicals reactions biologists analyze plant animal contributions carbon dioxide fluxes specialists meteorologists oceanographers additional breadth understanding atmospheric dynamics




biodiversity coral reef corals adapt modify environment forming calcium carbonate skeletons provides growing conditions future generations forms habitat many species


ecologyedit
main article ecology
ecology study interactions organisms environment ecologists might investigate relationship population organisms physical characteristic environment concentration chemical might investigate interaction populations different organisms symbiotic competitive relationship
example interdisciplinary analysis ecological system impacted stressors might include several related environmental science fields estuarine setting proposed industrial development could impact certain species water pollution biologists would describe flora fauna chemists would analyze transport water pollutants marsh physicists would calculate pollution emissions geologists would assist understanding marsh soils muds
environmental chemistryedit
main article environmental chemistry
environmental chemistry study chemical alterations environment principal areas study include soil contamination water pollution topics analysis include chemical degradation environment multiphase transport chemicals example evaporation solvent containing lake yield solvent pollutant chemical effects upon biota
example study consider case leaking solvent tank entered habitat soil endangered species amphibian method resolve understand extent soil contamination subsurface transport solvent computer model would implemented chemists would characterize molecular bonding solvent specific soil type biologists would study impacts upon soil arthropods plants ultimately ponddwelling organisms food endangered amphibian
geosciencesedit
main article geosciences
geosciences include environmental geology environmental soil science volcanic phenomena evolution earths crust classification systems also include hydrology including oceanography
example study soils erosion calculations would made surface runoff soil scientists fluvial geomorphologists would assist examining sediment transport overland flow physicists would contribute assessing changes light transmission receiving waters biologists would analyze subsequent impacts aquatic flora fauna increases water turbidity
