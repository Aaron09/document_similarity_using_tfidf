types strokes
table tennis strokes generally break offensive defensive categories
offensive strokes

direct ball propelling forward back opponent stroke differs speed drives racket sports like tennis racket primarily perpendicular direction stroke energy applied ball results speed rather spin creating shot much fast enough difficult return speed drive used mostly keeping ball play applying pressure opponent potentially opening opportunity powerful attack
loop
perfected 1960s1 loop essentially reverse speed drive racket much parallel direction stroke closed racket thus grazes ball resulting large amount topspin good loop drive quite striking opponents side table jump forward much like kick serve tennis
counterhit
counterhit usually counterattack drives normally high loop drives racket held closed near ball short movement bounce immediately hitting table ball travels faster side welltimed accurate counterdrive effective smash
flip
player tries attack ball bounced beyond edge table player room wind backswing ball still attacked however resulting shot called flip backswing compressed quick wrist action flip single stroke resemble either loop drive loop characteristics identifies stroke backswing compressed short wrist flick
smash
offensive trump card smash player typically execute smash opponent returned ball bounces high close smashing consists using large backswing rapid acceleration impart much speed ball possible goal smash ball move quickly opponent simply cannot return ball speed main shot often spin ball something topspin sidespin used effectively smash alter balls trajectory significantly although intermediate players smash ball little spin offensive table tennis player think rally buildup winning smash
defensive strokes
push
push slice asia usually used keeping point alive creating offensive opportunities push resembles tennis slice racket cuts underneath ball imparting backspin causing ball float slowly side table obvious push difficult attack backspin ball causes drop toward table upon striking opponents racket order attack push player must usually loop ball back often best option beginners simply push ball back resulting pushing rallies good players worst option opponent counter loop putting first player defensive position another response pushing flipping ball close pushing advantages circumstances opponent makes easy mistakes
chop
chop defensive backspin counterpart offensive loop drive50 chop essentially bigger heavier push taken well back table racket face points primarily horizontally perhaps little upward direction stroke straight object defensive chop match topspin opponents shot backspin good chop float nearly horizontally back table cases much backspin ball actually rises chop extremely difficult return enormous amount backspin defensive players also impart nospin sidespin variations chop
block
block simple shot nonetheless devastating attacking opponent block executed simply placing racket front ball right ball bounces thus ball rebounds back toward opponent nearly much energy came requires precision since balls spin speed location influence correct angle block possible opponent execute perfect loop drive smash blocked shot come back fast power involved offensive strokes often opponent simply cannot recover quickly enough unable return blocked shot blocks almost always produce spin received many times topspin depending spin ball block returned unexpected side table come advantage opponent expect

defensive possibly impressive shot since propels ball five metres height land opponents side table great amounts spin51 execute defensive player first backsoff table meters stroke consists lifting ball enormous height falls back opponents side table inherently creative shot nearly kind spin topquality players advantage order control spin ball instance though opponent smash ball hard fast good defensive could difficult return unpredictability heavy amounts spin ball51 thus though backed table tens feet running reach ball good defensive player still point using good lobs however professional level lobbers lose point time used unless really necessary
effects spin
adding spin onto ball causes major changes table tennis gameplay although nearly every stroke serve creates kind spin understanding individual types spin allows players defend different spins effectively52


phases backspin curve


backspin
backspin bottom half ball rotating away player imparted striking base ball downward movement52 professional level backspin usually used defensively order keep ball low53 backspin commonly employed service harder produce offensive return though professional level people serve sidespin either backspin topspin initial lift ball limit much speed ball without missing opponents side table however backspin also makes harder opponent return ball great speed required angular precision return alterations frequently made regulations regarding equipment effort maintain balance defensive offensive spin choicescitation needed actually possible smash backspin offensively high balls close


phases topspin curve


topspin
topspin stroke smaller influence first part ballcurve like backspin stroke however axis spin remains roughly perpendicular trajectory ball thus allowing magnus effect dictate subsequent curvature apex curve ball dips downwards approaches opposing side bouncing bounce topspin accelerate ball much wheel already spinning would accelerate upon making contact ground opponent attempts return ball topspin causes ball jump upwards opponent forced compensate topspin adjusting angle racket known closing racket speed limitation topspin stroke minor compared backspin stroke stroke predominant technique used professional competition gives opponent less time respond table tennis topspin regarded offensive technique increased ball speed lower biomechanical efficiency pressure puts opponent reducing reaction time possible play defensive topspinlobs behind table highly skilled players stroke tactical efficiency topspin least common type spin found service professional level simply much easier attack topspin ball moving high speed
sidespin
type spin predominantly employed service wherein contact angle racket easily varied unlike aforementioned techniques sidespin causes ball spin axis vertical rather horizontal axis rotation still roughly perpendicular trajectory ball circumstance magnus effect still dictate curvature ball degree another difference unlike backspin topspin sidespin relatively little effect bounce ball much spinning would travel left right axis rotation exactly vertical makes sidespin useful weapon service less easily recognized bouncing ball loses less spin bounce sidespin also employed offensive rally strokes often greater distance adjunct topspin backspin stroke sometimes referred hook hook even used extreme cases circumvent away table
corkspin
players employ type spin almost exclusively serving professional level also used time time unlike techniques mentioned corkspin drillspin axis spin relatively parallel balls trajectory magnus effect little effect trajectory corkspun ball upon bouncing ball dart right left according direction spin severely complicating return theory type spin produces obnoxious effects less strategically practical sidespin backspin limitations imposes upon opponent return aside initial direction change bouncing unless goes reach opponent counter either topspin backspin backspin stroke similar fact corkspin stroke lower maximum velocity simply contact angle racket producing stroke impart spin ball parallel trajectory racket must swung less perpendicular trajectory ball greatly limiting forward momentum racket transfers ball corkspin almost always mixed another variety spin since alone less effective also harder produce
