arteries
also arterial tree
oxygenated blood enters systemic circulation leaving left ventricle aortic semilunar valve first part systemic circulation aorta massive thickwalled artery aorta arches gives branches supplying upper part body passing aortic opening diaphragm level thoracic vertebra enters abdomen later descends supplies branches abdomen pelvis perineum lower limbs walls aorta elastic elasticity helps maintain blood pressure throughout body aorta receives almost five litres blood heart recoils responsible pulsating blood pressure moreover aorta branches smaller arteries elasticity goes decreasing compliance goes increasing
capillaries
arteries branch small passages called arterioles capillaries9 capillaries merge bring blood venous system10
veins
passage body tissues capillaries merge venules continue merge veins venous system finally coalesces major veins superior vena cava roughly speaking draining areas heart inferior vena cava roughly speaking areas heart great vessels empty right atrium heart
coronary vessels
main article coronary circulation
heart supplied oxygen nutrients small loop systemic circulation derives little blood contained within four chambers
portal veins
main article portal vein
general rule arteries heart branch capillaries collect veins leading back heart portal veins slight exception humans significant example hepatic portal vein combines capillaries around gastrointestinal tract blood absorbs various products digestion rather leading directly back heart hepatic portal vein branches second capillary system liver
heart

development
main article fetal circulation
development circulatory system starts vasculogenesis embryo human arterial venous systems develop different areas embryo arterial system develops mainly aortic arches pairs arches develop upper part embryo venous system arises three bilateral veins weeks embryogenesis fetal circulation begins within week development fetal circulation include lungs bypassed truncus arteriosus birth fetus obtains oxygen nutrients mother placenta umbilical cord12
arteries
main article aortic arches
human arterial system originates aortic arches dorsal aortae starting week embryonic life first second aortic arches regress forms maxillary arteries stapedial arteries respectively arterial system arises aortic arches aortic arch completely regresses
dorsal aortae present dorsal side embryo initially present sides embryo later fuse form basis aorta approximately thirty smaller arteries branch back sides branches form intercostal arteries arteries arms legs lumbar arteries lateral sacral arteries branches sides aorta form definitive renal suprarenal gonadal arteries finally branches front aorta consist vitelline arteries umbilical arteries vitelline arteries form celiac superior inferior mesenteric arteries gastrointestinal tract birth umbilical arteries form internal iliac arteries

lymphatic system
clinical significance
many diseases affect circulatory system includes cardiovascular disease affecting cardiovascular system lymphatic disease affecting lymphatic system cardiologists medical professionals specialise heart cardiothoracic surgeons specialise operating heart surrounding areas vascular surgeons focus parts circulatory system
cardiovascular disease
main article cardiovascular disease
diseases affecting cardiovascular system called cardiovascular disease
many diseases called lifestyle diseases develop time related persons exercise habits diet whether smoke lifestyle choices person makes atherosclerosis precursor many diseases small atheromatous plaques build walls medium large arteries eventually grow rupture occlude arteries also risk factor acute coronary syndromes diseases characterised sudden deficit oxygenated blood heart tissue atherosclerosis also associated problems aneurysm formation splitting dissection arteries
another major cardiovascular disease involves creation clot called thrombus originate veins arteries deep venous thrombosis mostly occurs legs cause clots veins legs particularly person stationary long time clots embolise meaning travel another location body results include pulmonary embolus transient ischaemic attacks stroke
cardiovascular diseases also congenital nature heart defects persistent fetal circulation circulatory changes supposed happen birth congenital changes circulatory system associated diseases large number anatomical variations

greek physician herophilus distinguished veins arteries thought pulse property arteries greek anatomist erasistratus observed arteries life bleed ascribed fact phenomenon escaping artery replaced blood entered small vessels veins arteries thus apparently postulated capillaries reversed flow blood20
