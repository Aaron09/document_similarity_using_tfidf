transliteration type conversion text script another1 involves swapping letters thus trans liter predictable ways
instance modern greek term ελληνική δημοκρατία usually translated hellenic republic usual transliteration latin script ellēnikḗ dēmokratía name russia cyrillic script россия usually transliterated rossiya
transliteration primarily concerned representing sounds original rather representing characters ideally accurately unambiguously thus example transliterated pronounced transliterated pronounced transliterated though pronounced exactly like long
conversely transcription notes sounds necessarily spelling ελληνική δημοκρατία could transcribed elinikí ðimokratía specify sounds written
