subcommittee designed ascii based earlier teleprinter encoding systems like character encodings ascii specifies correspondence digital patterns character symbols graphemes control characters allows digital devices communicate process store communicate characteroriented information written language ascii developed encodings included alphabetic characters numerical digits special graphic symbols include control characters compatible comité consultatif international téléphonique télégraphique ccitt international telegraph alphabet ita2 standard 19242122 fieldata 1956citation needed early ebcdic 1963 codes required ascii
ita2 turn based 5bit telegraph code émile baudot invented 1870 patented 187422
committee debated possibility shift function like ita2 would allow codes represented sixbit code shifted code character codes determine choices options following character codes allows compact encoding less reliable data transmission error transmitting shift code typically makes long part transmission unreadable standards committee decided shifting ascii required least sevenbit code1215
committee considered eightbit code since eight bits octets would allow fourbit patterns efficiently encode digits binarycoded decimal however would require data transmission send eight bits seven could suffice committee voted sevenbit code minimize costs associated data transmission since perforated tape time could record eight bits position also allowed parity error checking desired1217 eightbit machines octets native data type parity checking typically eighth printers high used enable italics printing
internal organizationedit
code patterned control codes together graphic codes together ease identification first called ascii sticksa11 positions reserved control characters1220 space character come graphics make sorting easier became position 20hex1237 reason many special signs commonly used separators placed digits committee decided important support uppercase 64character alphabets chose pattern ascii could reduced easily usable 64character graphic codes1228 done sixbit code 1963 lowercase letters therefore interleaved uppercase keep options available lowercase letters graphics special numeric codes arranged letters letter placed position 41hex match draft corresponding british standard1238 digits prefixed remaining bits correspond respective values binary making conversion binarycoded decimal straightforward
many nonalphanumeric characters positioned correspond shifted position typewriters important subtlety based mechanical typewriters electric typewriters24 mechanical typewriters followed standard remington 1878 first typewriter shift shifted values 23456789 early typewriters omitted using capital letter lowercase letter instead pairs became standard became common thus ascii placed second sticka11 positions corresponding digits adjacent sticka11 parentheses could correspond however place corresponding taken space character accommodated removing underscore shifting remaining characters corresponded many european typewriters placed parentheses discrepancy typewriters bitpaired keyboards notably teletype model used leftshifted layout corresponding ascii traditional mechanical typewriters electric typewriters notably selectric 1961 used somewhat different layout become standard computers following 1981 especially model 1984 thus shift values symbols modern keyboards correspond closely ascii table earlier keyboards pair also dates pairs used keyboards others including shift comma full stop could used uppercase without unshifting however ascii split pair dating rearranged mathematical symbols varied conventions commonly
common characters included notably included diacritics international mathematical together simple line characters addition common symbol used continental europe committee expected would replaced accented french variation placed position 40hex right letter a1243

character orderedit
asciicode order also called asciibetical order25 collation data sometimes done order rather standard alphabetical order collating sequence main deviations ascii order

uppercase come lowercase letters example precedes
digits many punctuation marks come letters

intermediate order converts uppercase letters lowercase comparing ascii values
character groupsedit
control charactersedit
main article control character
ascii reserves first codes numbers 0–31 decimal control characters codes originally intended represent printable information rather control devices printers make ascii provide metainformation data streams stored magnetic tape
example character represents line feed function causes printer advance paper character represents backspace 2822 refers control characters include carriage return line feed white space nonwhitespace control characters26 except control characters prescribe elementary lineoriented formatting ascii define mechanism describing structure appearance text within document schemes markup languages address page document layout formatting
original ascii standard used short descriptive phrases control character ambiguity caused sometimes intentional example character would used slightly differently terminal link data stream sometimes accidental example meaning delete
probably influential single device interpretation characters teletype model printing terminal available paper tape readerpunch option paper tape popular medium longterm program storage 1980s less costly ways less fragile magnetic tape particular teletype model machine assignments codes controlq also known controls also known xoff delete became facto standards model also notable taking description controlg code meaning audibly alert operator literally unit contained actual bell rang received character keytop also showed leftarrow symbol ascii1963 character instead underscore noncompliant code controlo shift interpreted delete previous character also adopted many early timesharing systems eventually became neglected
teletype equipped automatic paper tape reader received controls xoff abbreviation transmit caused tape reader stop receiving controlq transmit caused tape reader resume technique became adopted several early computer operating systems handshaking signal warning sender stop transmission impending overflow persists many systems manual output control technique systems controls retains meaning controlq replaced second controls resume output also could configured employ controlr controlt start stop tape punch units equipped function corresponding control character lettering keycap letter tape tape respectively27
code officially named delete teletype label rubout since original standard give detailed interpretation control codes interpretations code varied original teletype meaning intent standard make ignored character zeroes useful specifically paper tape punching allones pattern existing mark would obliterate it28 tapes designed hand edited could even produced spaces extra nuls blank tape block characters could rubbed replacements empty space
software assigned special meanings ascii characters sent software terminal operating systems digital equipment corporation example interpreted input character meaning remove previouslytyped input character2930 interpretation also became common unix systems systems used meaning used mean remove character cursorcitation needed latter interpretation common nowcitation needed
many control codes given meanings quite different original ones escape character code example intended originally allow sending control characters literals instead invoking meaning meaning escape encountered encodings language strings systems certain characters reserved meaning time meaning coopted eventually changed modern sent terminal usually indicates start command sequence usually form socalled ansi escape code properly control sequence introducer ecma48 1972 successors beginning followed leftbracket character sent terminal often used outofband character used terminate operation teco text editors graphical user interface windowing systems generally causes application abort current operation exit terminate altogether
inherent ambiguity many control characters combined historical usage created problems transferring plain text files systems best example newline problem various operating systems teletype machines required line text terminated carriage return moves printhead beginning line line feed advances paper line without moving printhead name carriage return comes fact manual typewriter carriage holding paper moved position typebars struck ribbon remained stationary entire carriage pushed returned right order position left margin paper next line

unfortunately requiring characters mark line introduces unnecessary complexity questions interpret character encountered alone simplify matters plain text data streams including files multics31 used line feed alone line terminator unix unixlike systems amiga systems adopted convention multics original macintosh apple prodos hand used carriage return alone line terminator however since apple replaced operating systems unixbased macos operating system line feed well radio shack trs80 also used lone terminate lines

early development48 ascii intended several national variants international character code standard
international standards bodies ratified character encodings 1967 identical nearly identical ascii extensions characters outside english alphabet symbols used outside united states symbol united kingdoms pound sterling almost every country needed adapted version ascii since ascii suited needs countries example canada version supported french characters
many countries developed variants ascii include nonenglish letters currency symbols also yuscii yugoslavia
would share characters common assign locally useful characters several code points reserved national however four years elapsed publication ascii1963 isos first acceptance international recommendation 196749 caused asciis choices national characters seem facto standards world causing confusion incompatibility countries begin make assignments code points
isoiec like ascii 7bit character make additional codes available code points encoded different characters different countries escape codes defined indicate national variant applied piece text rarely used often impossible know variant work therefore character code represented general textprocessing systems could cope variant anyway
bracket brace characters ascii assigned national code points used accented letters national variants isoiec german french swedish programmer using national variant isoiec rather ascii write thus read something

trigraphs created solve problem ansi although late introduction inconsistent implementation compilers limited many programmers kept computers usascii plaintext swedish german example email usenet contained similar variants middle words something programmers used example swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking lunch could smrgsar answer smörgåsar meaning sandwiches
8bit codesedit
main articles extended ascii isoiec 8859
also utf8
eventually 32bit later 64bit computers began replace 36bit computers norm became common 8bit byte store character memory providing opportunity extended 8bit relatives ascii cases developed true extensions ascii leaving original charactermapping intact adding additional character definitions first 7bit characters
encodings include iscii india viscii vietnam although encodings sometimes referred ascii true ascii defined strictly ansi standard
early home computer systems developed 8bit character sets containing linedrawing game glyphs often filled control characters graphics kaypro computers used upper characters greek alphabet
petscii code commodore international used 8bit systems probably unique among post1970 codes based ascii1963 instead common ascii1967 found spectrum computer atari 8bit computers galaksija computers also used ascii variants
