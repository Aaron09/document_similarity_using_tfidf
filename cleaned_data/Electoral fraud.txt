another strategy permanently move people electoral district usually public housing people eligible public housing likely vote particular party either concentrated area thus making votes count less moved marginal electorates balance towards preferred party notable example occurred city westminster england shirley porter6
immigration also used manipulate electoral demography instance malaysia gave citizenship immigrants neighboring philippines indonesia together suffrage order political party dominate state sabah controversial process known project
method manipulating primary contests elections party leaders related people support party temporarily join another party vote crossover permitted order elect weak candidate partys leadership goal ultimately defeat weak candidate general election leader party voter truly supports

groups also disenfranchised rules make impractical impossible cast vote example requiring people vote within electorate disenfranchise serving military personnel prison inmates students hospital patients anyone else cannot return homesexamples needed polling inconvenient days midweek holy days religious groups example sabbath holy days religious group whose teachings determine voting prohibited communities also effectively disenfranchised polling places situated areas perceived voters unsafe provided within reasonable proximity rural communities especially vulnerable thisexamples needed
cases voters invalidly disenfranchised true electoral fraud example legitimate voter “accidentally” removed electoral roll making difficult impossible person vote
canadian federal election 1917 great union government passed military voters wartime elections military voters permitted active military personnel vote party allowed party decide electoral district place vote also enfranchised women directly related married active soldier groups believed disproportionately favor union government party campaigning favor conscriptioncitation needed wartime elections conversely disenfranchised particular ethnic groups assumed disproportionately favor opposition liberal partycitation needed

legal threats case voters made believe accurately otherwise legally entitled vote legally obliged vote particular voters confident entitlement vote also intimidated real implied authority figures suggest vote entitled imprisoned deported otherwise punished1213 example 2004 wisconsin elsewhere voters allegedly received flyers said already voted election year can’t vote presidential election implying voted earlier primary elections ineligible vote also anybody family ever found guilty anything can’t vote presidential election finally violate laws years prison children taken away you1415 another method allegedly used cook county illinois 2004 falsely tell particular people eligible vote13
coercion demographic controlled voting ballot would persuade others follow singling majority people would attempt switch voters decision argument could since majority sides certain candidate admit defeat join winning side didnt work threatening violence seen countless times elections coercion electoral intimidation seen navy 1885 william whitney started investigation involved navy said whitney vote yard practically coerced controlled foremen instance shows even navy still instances people going great lengths desired elective

vote buyingedit
parts united states late 19th century members competing parties would sometimes openly times much greater secrecy sell votes voter would compensated cash covering one’s housetax payment since electoral fraud party would secretive means keep practice going evolved repercussions actions said earlier politicians publicly tried sway people vote mostly done town hall meeting large gatherings persuade numerous people side open discussion voting buying poor results written 1886 article york times said politicians town milton exercised alleged bribery votebuying town meeting keep practice vote buying secret parties would open vote buyingshop complete clerks manager16 shops kept secrecy buying parties kept wanted make claims unfair play operation would also runners would public find floating voters bargain vote side
people bought main focus market vote buying beginning voting candidates market opened business mark wahlgren summers writes market votes opened five dollars brisk demand strong upward tendency16 beginning election voters would receive five dollars election process continued people could obtain much fifty dollars vote dictation prices fluctuated since market election dwindled voters could receive high payments business report york 1888 dispatched information public helped floating voters better chances receiving greater compensation vote since knew reasonable offer furthermore complicated discussion runner floating voter runners bargaining cheapest prices voters desired receive highest payment could vote buying changes polls senator george edmunds remarked 1889 divisions parties several states close purchase comparatively small number votes could easily turn scale
england documentation stories vote buying vote selling also well known famous episodes vote buying came 18th century england rich aristocrats spent whatever money took notorious spendthrift election came northamptonshire 1768 three earls spent ₤100000 seat17

election statistically significant number voting machines randomly selected polling locations used testing used detect potential fraud malfunction unless manipulated software would start cheat certain event like voter pressing special combination machine might cheat someone doesnt perform combination requires insider access fewer voters
another form testing logic accuracy testing preelection testing voting machines using test votes determine functioning correctly
another method insure integrity electronic voting machines independent software verification certification42 software certified code signing insure software certified identical used election argue certification would effective voting machine software publicly available open source
certification testing processes conducted publicly oversight interested parties promote transparency election process integrity conducting testing questioned
testing certification prevent voting machines black voters sure counting inside done intended42
