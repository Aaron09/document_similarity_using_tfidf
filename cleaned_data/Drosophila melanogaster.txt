melanogaster males exhibit strong reproductive learning curve sexual experience flies tend modify future mating behavior multiple ways changes include increased selectivity courting intraspecifically well decreased courtship times
sexually naïve melanogaster males known spend significant time courting interspecifically simulans flies naïve melanogaster also attempt court females sexually mature males melanogaster males show little preference melanogaster females females species even male flies however simulans flies incapable copulation rejected males’ advances melanogaster males much less likely spend time courting nonspecifically future apparent learned behavior modification seems evolutionarily significant allows males avoid investing energy futile sexual encounters22
addition males previous sexual experience modify courtship dance attempting mate females experienced males spend less time courting therefore lower mating latencies meaning able reproduce quickly decreased mating latency leads greater mating efficiency experienced males naïve males23 modification also appears obvious evolutionary advantages increased mating efficiency extremely important eyes natural selection
polygamyedit
male female melanogaster polygamously multiple sexual partners time24 males females polygamy results decrease evening activity compared virgin flies males females24 evening activity consists activities flies participate mating finding partners finding food25 reproductive success males females varies fact female needs mate reach maximum fertility25 mating multiple partners provides advantage mating partner therefore females exhibit difference evening activity polygamous monogamous individuals25 males however mating multiple partners increases reproductive success increasing genetic diversity offspring25 benefit genetic diversity evolutionary advantage increases chance offspring traits increase fitness environment
difference evening activity polygamous monogamous male flies explained courtship polygamous flies reproductive success increases offspring multiple partners therefore spend time energy courting multiple females25 hand monogamous flies court female expend less energy so25 requires energy male flies court multiple females overall reproductive benefits produces kept polygamy preferred sexual choice25

melanogaster types clockwise brown eyes black body cinnabar eyes sepia eyes ebony body vermilion eyes white eyes wildtype eyes yellow body


melanogaster studied organisms biological research particularly genetics developmental biology several reasons include

care culture require little equipment space expense even using large cultures
safely readily anesthetized usually ether carbon dioxide cooling products like flynap
morphology easy identify anesthetized
short generation time days room temperature several generations studied within weeks
high fecundity females eggs perhaps 2000 lifetime3
males females readily distinguished virgin females easily isolated facilitating genetic crossing
mature larvae giant chromosomes salivary glands called polytene chromosomes—puffs indicate regions transcription hence gene activity
four pairs chromosomes three autosomes pair chromosomes
males show meiotic recombination facilitating genetic studies
recessive lethal balancer chromosomes carrying visible genetic markers used keep stocks lethal alleles heterozygous state without recombination multiple inversions balancer
development organism—from fertilized mature adult—is well understood
genetic transformation techniques available since 1987
complete genome sequenced first published 200029
sexual mosaics readily produced providing additional tool studying development behavior flies30

genetic markersedit
genetic markers commonly used drosophila research example within balancer chromosomes pelement inserts phenotypes easily identifiable either naked microscope list common markers allele symbol followed name gene affected description phenotype note recessive alleles lower case dominant alleles capitalised

curly wings curve away body flight somewhat impaired
ebony black body wings heterozygotes also visibly darker wild type
stubble bristles shorter thicker wild type
white eyes lack pigmentation appear white
yellow body pigmentation wings appear yellow analog albinism

drosophila genes traditionally named phenotype cause mutated example absence particular gene drosophila result mutant embryo develop heart scientists thus called gene tinman named character name31 system nomenclature results wider range gene names organisms
