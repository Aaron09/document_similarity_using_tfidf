marxist theory modern mode production consists main economic parts base superstructure base encompasses relations production employer–employee work conditions technical division labour property relations social class according marx determined ones relationship means production exist least classes classbased society owners means production sell labor owners means production times marx almost hints ruling classes seem working class labor power wage labor offer powerful order survive relations fundamentally determine ideas philosophies society additional classes form part superstructure ideology ruling class—throughout much history landowning aristocracy—false consciousness promoted political nonpolitical institutions also arts elements culture aristocracy falls bourgeoisie become owners means production capitalist system marx predicted capitalist mode would eventually give internal conflict revolutionary consciousness development egalitarian communist societies
marx also described classes petite bourgeoisie lumpenproletariat petite bourgeoisie like small business class never really accumulates enough profit become part bourgeoisie even challenge status lumpenproletariat underclass little social status includes prostitutes beggars homeless untouchables given society neither subclasses much influence marxs major classes helpful know marx recognize differences within classes5
according marvin harris6 ingold7 lewis henry morgans accounts egalitarian huntergatherers formed part karl marx friedrich engels inspiration communism morgan spoke situation people living community pooled efforts shared rewards efforts fairly equally called communism living marx expanded ideas still emphasized economically oriented culture property defining fundamental relationships people8 issues ownership property arguably less emphasized huntergatherer societies9 combined different social economic situations huntergatherers account many difficulties encountered implementing communism industrialized states ingold points notion communism removed context domesticity harnessed support project social engineering largescale industrialized states populations millions eventually came mean something quite different morgan intended namely principle redistribution would override ties personal familial nature cancel effects7

weberedit
main articles threecomponent theory stratification tripartite classification authority
weber strongly influenced marxs ideas rejected possibility effective communism arguing would require even greater level detrimental social control bureaucratization capitalist society moreover weber criticized dialectical presumption proletariat revolt maintaining unlikely11 instead develops threecomponent theory stratification concept life chances weber held class divisions marx suggested taking different concepts functionalist marxist theories create system emphasizes difference class status power treats separate related sources power different effects social action working half century later marx weber claims four main social classes upper class white collar workers petite bourgeoisie manual working class webers theory moreclosely resembles contemporary western class structures although economic status currently seem depend strictly earnings weber envisioned
weber derives many concepts social stratification examining social structure germany notes contrary marxs theories stratification based simple ownership capital weber examines many members aristocracy lacked economic wealth strong political power many wealthy families lacked prestige power example jewish weber introduced three independent factors form theory stratification hierarchy class status power

class persons economic position society based birth individual achievement12 weber differs marx supreme factor stratification weber notes corporate executives control firms typically marx would placed people proletariat despite high incomes virtue fact sell labor instead owning capital
status persons prestige social honor popularity society weber notes political power rooted capital value solely also ones individual status poets saints example extensive influence society despite material resources
power persons ability despite resistance others particularly ability engage social change example individuals government jobs employee federal bureau investigation member united states congress hold little property status still wield considerable social power13

wright millsedit
main article elite theory
wright mills drawing theories vilfredo pareto gaetano mosca contends imbalance power society derives complete absence countervailing powers corporate leaders power elite1415 mills incorporated revised marxist ideas shared marxs recognition dominant wealthy powerful class mills believed source power economic realm also political military arenas14 1950s mills stated hardly anyone knew power elites existence individuals including elite denied idea group people vaguely believed small formation powerful elite existed14 prominent individuals knew congress permitted handful political leaders make critical decisions peace atomic bombs dropped japan name united states neither anyone knew consulted14
mills explains power elite embody privileged class whose members able recognize high position within society14 order maintain highly exalted position within society members power elite tend marry another understand accept another also work together1415pp crucial aspect power elites existence lays within core education14 youthful upperclass members attend prominent preparatory schools open doors elite universities harvard yale princeton also universities highly exclusive clubs memberships turn pave prominent social clubs located major cities serving sites important business contacts1415p 63–67 examples elite members attended prestigious universities members highly exclusive clubs seen george bush john kerry bush kerry members skull bones club attending yale university16 club includes members powerful twentieth century forbidden tell others secrets exclusive club throughout years skull bones club included presidents cabinet officers supreme court justices spies captains industry often sons daughters join exclusive club creating social political network like none ever seen before16
upper class individuals receive elite educations typically essential background contacts enter three branches power elite political leadership military circle corporate elite14

political leadership mills held prior world leaders corporations became prominent within political sphere along decline central decisionmaking among professional politicians14
military circle 1950s1960s increasing concerns warfare resulted military leaders issues involving defense funding military personnel training becoming priority within united states prominent politicians corporate leaders strong proponents military spending
corporate elite mills explains 1950s military emphasis recognized corporate leaders worked prominent military officers dominated development policies corporate leaders highranking military officers mutually supportive other1415pp 274–276

mills shows power elite innercore made individuals able move position institutional power another example prominent military officer becomes political adviser powerful politician becomes corporate executive14 people knowledge greater breadth interests colleagues prominent bankers financiers mills considered almost professional gobetweens economic political military affairs also members elites inner core1415pp 288–289
