early historyedit
ancient greece aristotle 384322 observed fossils seashells rocks resembled found beaches inferred fossils rocks formed living animals reasoned positions land changed long periods time leonardo vinci 1452–1519 concurred aristotles interpretation fossils represented remains ancient life6
11thcentury persian geologist avicenna sina died 1037 13thcentury dominican bishop albertus magnus died 1280 extended aristotles explanation theory petrifying fluid7 avicenna also first proposed principles underlying geologic time scales superposition strata discussing origins mountains book healing 102789 chinese naturalist shen 1031–1095 also recognized concept deep time10
establishment primary principlesedit
late 17th century nicholas steno 1638–1686 pronounced principles underlying geologic geological time scales steno argued rock layers strata laid succession represents slice time also formulated superposition states given stratum probably older younger stenos principles simple applying proved challenging course 18th century geologists realized

sequences strata often become eroded distorted tilted even inverted deposition
strata laid time different areas could entirely different appearances
strata given area represented part earths long history

neptunist theories popular time expounded abraham werner 1749–1817 late 18th century proposed rocks precipitated single enormous flood major shift thinking came james hutton presented theory earth investigation laws observable composition dissolution restoration land upon globe11 royal society edinburgh march april 1785 saidby things appear perspective 20th century james hutton readings became founder modern geology1295100 hutton proposed interior earth heat engine drove creation rock land eroded water deposited layers heat consolidated sediment stone uplifted lands theory known plutonism stood contrast neptunist floodoriented theory
formulation geologic time scaleedit
first serious attempts formulate geologic time scale could applied anywhere earth made late 18th century influential early attempts championed werner among others divided rocks earths crust four types primary secondary tertiary quaternary type rock according theory formed specific period earth history thus possible speak tertiary period well tertiary rocks indeed tertiary paleogene neogene remained name geological period well 20th century quaternary remains formal name current period
identification strata fossils contained pioneered william smith georges cuvier jean domalius dhalloy alexandre brogniart early 19th century enabled geologists divide earth history precisely also enabled correlate strata across national even continental boundaries strata however distant space different composition contained fossils chances good laid time detailed studies 1820 1850 strata fossils europe produced sequence geological periods still used today
naming geologic periods eras epochsedit
early work developing geologic time scale dominated british geologists names geologic periods reflect dominance cambrian classical name wales ordovician silurian named ancient welsh tribes periods defined using stratigraphic sequences wales12113–114 devonian named english county devon name carboniferous adaptation coal measures british geologists’ term strata permian named perm russia defined using strata region scottish geologist roderick murchison however periods defined geologists countries triassic named 1834 german geologist friedrich alberti three distinct layers latin trias meaning triad—red beds capped chalk followed black shales—that found throughout germany northwest europe called ‘trias’ jurassic named french geologist alexandre brogniart extensive marine limestone exposures jura mountains cretaceous latin creta meaning ‘chalk’ separate period first defined belgian geologist jean domalius dhalloy 1822 using strata paris basin13 named extensive beds chalk calcium carbonate deposited shells marine invertebrates found western europe
british geologists also responsible grouping periods eras subdivision tertiary quaternary periods epochs 1841 john phillips published first global geologic time scale based types fossils found phillips’ scale helped standardize terms like paleozoic life extended cover larger period previous usage mesozoic middle life invented14
dating time scalesedit
main article chronological dating
william smith charles lyell first recognized rock strata represented successive time periods time scales could estimated imprecisely since estimates rates change uncertain creationists proposing dates around seven thousand years earth based bible early geologists suggesting millions years geologic periods even suggesting virtually infinite earthcitation needed geologists paleontologists constructed geologic table based relative positions different strata fossils estimated time scales based studying rates various kinds weathering erosion sedimentation lithification discovery radioactivity 1896 development geological applications radiometric dating first half 20th century ages various rock strata earth subject considerable debate
first geologic time scale included absolute dates published 1913 british geologist arthur holmes15 greatly furthered newly created discipline geochronology published worldrenowned book earth estimated earths least billion years16

anthropoceneedit
term anthropocene used informally popular culture growing number scientists describe current epoch living term coined paul crutzen eugene stoermer 2000 describe current time humans enormous impact environment evolved describe epoch starting time past whole defined anthropogenic carbon emissions production consumption plastic goods left ground20
critics term term used difficult nearly impossible define specific time humans started influencing rock strata—defining start epoch21 others humans even started leave biggest impact earth therefore anthropocene even started whatever case officially approved term september 2015update22
