1981 nicholas immediate family recognised martyred saints russian orthodox church outside russia august 2000 recognised synod russian orthodox church time named martyrs since deaths result immediately christian faith instead canonised passion bearers according statement moscow synod glorified saints following reasons

last orthodox russian monarch members family people sincerely strove incarnate lives commands gospel suffering borne royal family prison humility patience meekness martyrs deaths yekaterinburg night july 1918 revealed light faith christ conquers evil

however nicholass canonisation controversial russian orthodox church abroad split issue back 1981 members suggesting emperor weak ruler failed thwart rise bolsheviks pointed priest martyrdom russian orthodox church nothing martyrs personal actions instead related killed128
russian orthodox church inside russia rejected familys classification martyrs killed account religious faith religious leaders churches also objections canonising tsars family perceived weak emperor whose incompetence revolution suffering people made partially responsible murder wife children servants opponents fact tsar private life kind good husband father leader showed genuine concern peasantry override poor governance russia128

assessment
nicholas generally considered incompetent colossal task ruling enormous russian empire129 historian barbara tuchman gives damning evaluation reign

russian empire ruled sovereign idea government—to preserve intact absolute monarchy bequeathed father—and lacking intellect energy training fell back personal favorites whim simple mulishness devices emptyheaded autocrat father alexander deliberately intended keep uneducated statecraft thirty unfortunately miscalculated life expectancy died nicholas twentysix tsar learned nothing interval impression imperturbability conveyed reality apathy—the indifference mind shallow surface telegram brought announcing annihilation russian fleet tsushima read stuffed pocket went playing tennis130

russia nicholas faced widespread criticism victory revolution pavel bykov russia wrote first full account downfall tsar denounced nicholas tyrant paid life ageold repression arbitrary rule ancestors russian people impoverished bloodsoaked country sovietera historians noted nicholas statesman argued weak manipulated adventurist forces regime condemned extensive army police courts destroy revolutionary movement criticised fanning nationalism chauvinism punitive expeditions courtsmartial 1905 revolution monarch became known nicholas bloody nicholass reign seen time suffering russians3
robert massie provides sympathetic view tsar

still political reasons continue insist nicholas bloody nicholas commonly described shallow weak stupid—a onedimensional figure presiding feebly last days corrupt crumbling system certainly prevailing public image last tsar historians admit nicholas good man—the historical evidence personal charm gentleness love family deep religious faith strong russian patriotism overwhelming denied—but argue personal factors irrelevant matters nicholas tsar essentially tragedy nicholas appeared wrong place history131
