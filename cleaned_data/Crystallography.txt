crystallographic methods depend analysis diffraction patterns sample targeted beam type xrays commonly used beams used include electrons neutrons facilitated wave properties particles crystallographers often explicitly state type beam used terms xray crystallography neutron diffraction electron diffraction three types radiation interact specimen different ways

xrays interact spatial distribution electrons sample
electrons charged particles therefore interact total charge distribution atomic nuclei electrons sample
neutrons scattered atomic nuclei strong nuclear forces addition magnetic moment neutrons nonzero therefore also scattered magnetic fields neutrons scattered hydrogencontaining materials produce diffraction patterns high noise levels however material sometimes treated substitute deuterium hydrogen

different forms interaction three types radiation suitable different crystallographic studies

image small object made using lens focus beam similar lens microscope however wavelength visible light 4000 7000 ångström three orders magnitude longer length typical atomic bonds atoms therefore obtaining information spatial arrangement atoms requires radiation shorter wavelengths xray neutron beams employing shorter wavelengths implied abandoning microscopy true imaging however exists material lens capable focusing type radiation createdcitation needed scientists success focusing xrays microscopic fresnel zone plates made gold criticalangle reflection inside long tapered capillaries2 diffracted xray neutron beams cannot focused produce images sample structure must reconstructed diffraction pattern sharp features diffraction pattern arise periodic repeating structure sample often strong coherent reflection many photons many regularly spaced instances similar structure nonperiodic components structure result diffuse usually weak diffraction features areas higher density repetition atom order tend reflect light toward point space compared areas fewer atoms less repetition

notationedit
main article miller index

coordinates square brackets denote direction vector real space
coordinates angle brackets chevrons denote family directions related symmetry operations cubic crystal system example would mean negative directions
miller indices parentheses denote plane crystal structure regular repetitions plane particular spacing cubic system normal plane direction lowersymmetry cases normal parallel
indices curly brackets braces denote family planes normals equivalent cubic materials symmetry operations much angle brackets denote family directions noncubic materials necessarily perpendicular

techniquesedit
materials analyzed crystallographically proteins occur naturally crystals typically molecules placed solution allowed slowly crystallize vapor diffusion drop solution containing molecule buffer precipitants sealed container reservoir containing hygroscopic solution water drop diffuses reservoir slowly increasing concentration allowing crystal form concentration rise quickly molecule would simply precipitate solution resulting disorderly granules rather orderly hence usable crystal
crystal obtained data collected using beam radiation although many universities engage crystallographic research xray producing equipment synchrotrons often used xray sources purer complete patterns sources generate synchrotron sources also much higher intensity xray beams data collection takes fraction time normally necessary weaker sources complementary neutron crystallography techniques used identify positions hydrogen atoms since xrays interact weakly light elements hydrogen
producing image diffraction pattern requires sophisticated mathematics often iterative process modelling refinement process mathematically predicted diffraction patterns hypothesized model structure compared actual pattern generated crystalline sample ideally researchers make several initial guesses refinement converge answer models refined predicted patterns match great degree achieved without radical revision model painstaking process made much easier today computers
mathematical methods analysis diffraction data apply patterns turn result waves diffract orderly arrays hence crystallography applies part crystals molecules coaxed crystallize sake measurement spite certain amount molecular information deduced patterns generated fibers powders perfect solid crystal exhibit degree order level order sufficient deduce structure simple molecules determine coarse features complicated molecules example doublehelical structure deduced xray diffraction pattern generated fibrous sample
materials scienceedit
crystallography used materials scientists characterize different materials single crystals effects crystalline arrangement atoms often easy macroscopically natural shapes crystals reflect atomic structure addition physical properties often controlled crystalline defects understanding crystal structures important prerequisite understanding crystallographic defects mostly materials occur single crystal polycrystalline form aggregate small crystals different orientations powder diffraction method takes diffraction patterns polycrystalline samples large number crystals plays important role structural determination
physical properties also linked crystallography example minerals clay form small flat platelike structures clay easily deformed platelike particles slip along plane plates remain strongly connected direction perpendicular plates mechanisms studied crystallographic texture measurements
another example iron transforms bodycentered cubic structure facecentered cubic structure called austenite heated structure closepacked structure unlike structure thus volume iron decreases transformation occurs
crystallography useful phase identification manufacturing using material generally desirable know compounds phases present material composition structure proportions influence materials properties phase characteristic arrangement atoms xray neutron diffraction used identify patterns present material thus compounds present crystallography covers enumeration symmetry patterns formed atoms crystal reason related group theory geometry
