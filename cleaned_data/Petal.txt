diagram showing parts mature flower example perianth separated calyx sepals corolla petals


petals modified leaves surround reproductive parts flowers often brightly colored unusually shaped attract pollinators together petals flower called corolla petals usually accompanied another special leaves called sepals collectively form calyx beneath corolla calyx corolla together make perianth petals sepals flower difficult distinguish collectively called tepals examples plants term tepal appropriate include genera aloe tulipa conversely genera rosa phaseolus welldistinguished sepals petals undifferentiated tepals resemble petals referred petaloid petaloid monocots orders monocots brightly coloured tepals since include liliales alternative name lilioid monocots
although petals usually conspicuous parts animalpollinated flowers windpollinated species grasses either small petals lack entirely

corollaedit




corolla forming tube long points separate green calyx tube


role corolla plant evolution studied extensively since charles darwin postulated theory origin elongated corollae corolla tubes1
corolla separate tepals apopetalous petals free another corolla plant polypetalous choripetalous petals least partially fused together gamopetalous sympetalous case fused tepals term syntepalous corolla plants forms tube
variationsedit




pelargonium peltatum floral structure almost identical geraniums conspicuously zygomorphic






geranium incanum actinomorphic flower typical genus

narcissus pseudonarcissus showing bend flower spathe floral tepals corona


petals differ dramatically different species number petals flower hold clues plants classification example flowers eudicots largest group dicots frequently four five petals flowers monocots three petals although many exceptions rule2
petal whorl corolla either radially bilaterally symmetrical symmetry biology floral symmetry petals essentially identical size shape flower said regular actinomorphic meaning rayformed many flowers symmetrical plane symmetry bilateral termed irregular zygomorphic meaning yoke pairformed irregular flowers floral parts modified regular form petals show greatest deviation radial symmetry examples zygomorphic flowers seen orchids members family
many plants aster family sunflower helianthus annuus circumference flower head composed florets floret anatomically individual flower single large petal florets centre disc typically reduced petals plants narcissus lower part petals tepals fused form floral hypanthium ovary petals proper extend345
petal often consists parts upper broad part similar leaf blade also called blade lower part narrow similar leaf petiole called claw separated limb claws developed petals flowers family brassicaceae erysimum cheiri6
inception development petals shows great variety patterns7 petals different species plants vary greatly colour colour pattern visible light ultraviolet patterns often function guides pollinators variously known nectar guides pollen guides floral guides
geneticsedit
genetics behind formation petals accordance model flower development sepals petals stamens carpels modified versions appears mechanisms form petals evolved times perhaps rather evolving repeatedly stamens8
significance pollinationedit
pollination important step sexual reproduction higher plants pollen produced male flower male organs hermaphroditic flowers
pollen move thus requires wind animal pollinators disperse pollen stigma botany nearby flowers however pollinators rather selective determining flowers choose pollinate develops competition flowers result flowers must provide incentives appeal pollinators unless flower selfpollinates involved wind pollination petals play major role competing attract pollinators henceforth pollination dispersal could occur survival many species flowers could prolong
functions purposesedit
petals various functions purposes depending type plant general petals operate protect parts flower attractrepel specific pollinators
functionedit
positioning flower petals located flower corolla buttercup shiny yellow flower petals contain guidelines amongst petals aiding pollinator towards nectar pollinators ability determine specific flowers wish pollinate9 using incentives flowers draw pollinators mutual relation case pollinators remember always guard pollinate flowers unless incentives consistently competition prevails10
scentedit
petals could produce different scents allure desirable pollinators11 repel undesirable pollinators12 flowers also mimic scents produced materials decaying meat attract pollinators them13
colouredit
various colour traits used different petals could attract pollinators poor smelling abilities come certain parts flowers able change colour petals signal mutual pollinators approach keep away14
shape sizeedit
furthermore shape size flowerpetals important selecting type pollinators need example large petals flowers attract pollinators large distance large themselves14 collectively scent colour shape petals play role attractingrepelling specific pollinators providing suitable conditions pollinating pollinators include insects birds bats wind14 petals distinction made lower narrowed stalklike basal part referred claw wider distal part referred blade often claw blade angle another
types pollinationedit
wind pollinationedit
main article anemophily
windpollinated flowers often small dull petals produce little scent flowers often petals flowers depend wind pollination produce large amounts pollen pollen scattered wind tends reach flowers15
attracting insectsedit
flowers various regulatory mechanisms order attract insects helpful mechanism colour guiding marks insects butterfly ultraviolet marks contained flowers acting attractive mechanism visible towards human many flowers contain variety shapes acting landing visiting insect also influence insect brush anthers stigmas parts flower example flower pōhutukawa metrosideros excelsa acts regulate colour within different pōhutukawa contains small petals also bright large clusters stamens14 another attractive mechanism flowers scent highly attractive towards humans rose fragrant within attracting flies smell rotting meat dark another factor flowers grown adapt conditions colour lacks vision night therefore scent solution flowers pollinated night flying insects moth14
attracting birdsedit
flowers also pollinated birds must large colorful visible natural scenery bird –pollinated native plants include kōwhai sophora species flax phormium tenax harakeke kākā beak clianthus puniceus kōwhai ngutukākā interestingly enough flowers adapt mechanism petals change colour acting communicative mechanism bird visit example tree fuchsia fuchsia excorticata kōtukutuku green needing pollinated turn birds stop coming pollinating flower14
batpollinated flowersedit
flowers pollinated short tailed bats example dactylanthus dactylanthus taylorii plant home ground acting role parasite roots forest trees dactylanthus flowers pointing surface flowers lack colour advantage containing lots nectar strong scent useful mechanism attracting bat16
