structureedit
diaphragm shaped structure muscle fibrous tissue separates thoracic cavity abdomen dome curves upwards superior surface dome forms floor thoracic cavity inferior surface roof abdominal cavity3
dome diaphragm peripheral attachments structures make abdominal chest walls muscle fibres attachments converge central tendon forms crest dome3 peripheral part consists muscular fibers take origin circumference inferior thoracic aperture converge inserted central tendon
muscle fibres diaphragm emerge many surrounding structures front fibres insert xiphoid process along costal margin laterally muscle fibers insert ribs back muscle fibres insert vertebra appendages right left crus descend insert lumbar vertebrae l234
lumbocostal arches medial lateral either side
crura central tendonedit
left right crura tendons blend anterior longitudinal ligament vertebral column
central tendon diaphragm thin strong aponeurosis near center vault formed muscle closer front back thorax posterior muscular fibers longer
openingsedit
number openings diaphragm structures pass thorax abdomen three large openings—the aortic esophageal caval opening—plus series smaller ones




human diaphragm frontal view showing openings


inferior vena cava passes caval opening quadrilateral opening junction right middle leaflets central tendon margins tendinous surrounded tendons opening stretched open every time inspiration occurs however argument caval opening actually constricts inspiration since thoracic pressure decreases upon inspiration draws caval blood upwards toward right atrium increasing size opening allows blood return heart maximizing efficacy lowered thoracic pressure returning blood heart aorta pierce diaphragm rather passes behind left right crus

innervationedit
diaphragm primarily innervated phrenic nerve formed cervical nerves central portion diaphragm sends sensory afferents phrenic nerve peripheral portions diaphragm send sensory afferents intercostal t5–t11 subcostal nerves
blood supplyedit







arteries veins diaphragm supply drain blood
diaphragm receives blood branches internal thoracic arteries namely pericardiophrenic artery musculophrenic artery superior phrenic arteries arise directly thoracic aorta lower internal intercostal arteries inferior phrenic arteries supply diaphragm3
diaphragm drains blood brachiocephalic veins azygos veins veins drain inferior vena cava left suprarenal vein3
variationedit
sternal portion muscle sometimes wanting rarely defects occur lateral part central tendon adjoining muscle fibers
developmentedit
thoracic diaphragm develops embryogenesis beginning third week fertilization processes known transverse folding longitudinal folding septum transversum primitive central tendon diaphragm originates rostral pole embryo relocated longitudinal folding ventral thoracic region transverse folding brings body wall anteriorly enclose body cavities pleuroperitoneal membrane body wall myoblasts somatic lateral plate mesoderm meet septum transversum close pericardioperitoneal canals either side presumptive esophagus forming barrier separates peritoneal pleuropericardial cavities furthermore dorsal mesenchyme surrounding presumptive esophagus form muscular crura diaphragm
earliest element embryological diaphragm septum transversum forms cervical region phrenic nerve innervates diaphragm originates cervical spinal cord septum transversum descends inferiorly phrenic nerve follows accounting circuitous route upper cervical vertebrae around pericardium finally innervate diaphragm
functionedit

realtime magnetic resonance imaging showing effects diaphragm movement breathing


diaphragm main muscle respiration functions breathing inhalation diaphragm contracts moves inferior direction enlarging volume thoracic cavity reducing intrathoracic pressure external intercostal muscles also participate enlargement forcing lungs expand words diaphragms movement downwards creates partial vacuum thoracic cavity forces lungs expand fill void drawing process
cavity expansion happens extremes along intermediary forms lower ribs stabilized central tendon diaphragm mobile contraction brings insertion central tendon towards origins pushes lower cavity towards pelvis allowing thoracic cavity expand downward often called belly breathing central tendon stabilized lower ribs mobile contraction lifts origins ribs towards insertion central tendon works conjunction muscles allow ribs slide thoracic cavity expand laterally upwards
diaphragm relaxes exhaled elastic recoil process lung tissues lining thoracic cavity assisting function muscular effort called forced exhalation involves internal intercostal muscles used conjunction abdominal muscles antagonist paired diaphragms contraction
diaphragm also involved nonrespiratory functions helping expel vomit feces urine body increasing intraabdominal pressure aiding childbirth5 preventing acid reflux exerting pressure esophagus passes esophageal hiatus
nonhuman animals diaphragm crucial breathing instance survive fairly asymptomatically diaphragmatic paralysis long massive aerobic metabolic demands made
clinical significanceedit
paralysisedit
either phrenic nerve cervical spine brainstem damaged sever nervous supply diaphragm common damage phrenic nerve bronchial cancer usually affects side diaphragm causes include guillain–barré syndrome systemic lupus erythematosis6
herniationedit
main articles hiatus hernia congenital diaphragmatic hernia
hiatus hernia hernia common adults parts lower esophagus stomach normally abdomen pass bulge abnormally diaphragm present thorax hernias described rolling hernia beside oesophagus sliding hernia directly involves esophagus hernias implicated development reflux different pressures thorax abdomen normally keep pressure esophageal hiatus herniation pressure longer present angle cardia stomach oesophagus disappear hiatus hernias cause symptoms however although almost people barretts oesophagus oesophagitis hiatus hernia6
hernias also occur result congenital malformation congenital diaphragmatic hernia pleuroperitoneal membranes fail fuse diaphragm effective barrier abdomen thorax herniation usually left commonly posterior lumbocostal triangle although rarely anterior foramen morgagni contents abdomen including intestines present thorax impact development growing lungs lead hypoplasia7 condition present 2000 births large herniation mortality rate three four requires immediate surgical repaircitation needed
