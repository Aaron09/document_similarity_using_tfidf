causes droughtedit
precipitation deficiencyedit
also precipitation
mechanisms producing precipitation include convective stratiform6 orographic rainfall7 convective processes involve strong vertical motions cause overturning atmosphere location within hour cause heavy precipitation8 stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions less intense precipitation longer duration9 precipitation divided three categories based whether falls liquid water liquid water freezes contact surface droughts occur mainly areas normal levels rainfall factors support precipitation volumes sufficient reach surface sufficient time result drought drought triggered high level reflected sunlight average prevalence high pressure systems winds carrying continental rather oceanic masses ridges high pressure areas aloft prevent restrict developing thunderstorm activity rainfall certain region region within drought feedback mechanisms local arid air10 conditions promote warm core ridging11 minimal evapotranspiration worsen drought conditions
seasonedit
also season
within tropics distinct seasons emerge movement intertropical convergence zone monsoon trough12 season greatly increases drought occurrence13 characterized humidity watering holes rivers drying lack watering holes many grazing animals forced migrate lack water feed fertile spots examples animals zebras elephants14 wildebeest lack water plants bushfires common15 since water vapor becomes energetic increasing temperature water vapor required increase relative humidity values higher temperatures temperature fall point16 periods warmth quicken pace fruit vegetable production17 increase evaporation transpiration plants18 worsen drought conditions19

erosion human activitiesedit
also aeolian processes
human activity directly trigger exacerbating factors farming excessive irrigation21 deforestation erosion adversely impact ability land capture hold water22 arid climates main source erosion wind23 erosion result material movement wind wind cause small particles lifted therefore moved another region deflation suspended particles within wind impact solid objects causing erosion abrasion ecological succession wind erosion generally occurs areas little vegetation often areas insufficient rainfall support vegetation24

loess homogeneous typically nonstratified porous friable slightly coherent often calcareous finegrained silty pale yellow buff windblown aeolian sediment25 generally occurs widespread blanket deposit covers areas hundreds square kilometers tens meters thick loess often stands either steep vertical faces26 loess tends develop highly rich soils appropriate climatic conditions areas loess among agriculturally productive world27 loess deposits geologically unstable nature erode readily therefore windbreaks trees bushes often planted farmers reduce wind erosion loess23 wind erosion much severe arid areas times drought example great plains estimated soil loss wind erosion much 6100 times greater drought years years28
climate changeedit
also climate change
activities resulting global climate change expected trigger droughts substantial impact agriculture2930 throughout world especially developing nations313233 overall global warming result increased world rainfall34 along drought areas flooding erosion increase others paradoxically proposed solutions global warming focus active techniques solar radiation management space sunshade also carry increased chances drought35
typesedit
drought persists conditions surrounding gradually worsen impact local population gradually increases people tend define droughts three main ways

meteorological drought brought prolonged time less average precipitation meteorological drought usually precedes kinds drought37
agricultural droughts affect crop production ecology range condition also arise independently change precipitation levels soil conditions erosion triggered poorly planned agricultural endeavors cause shortfall water available crops however traditional drought caused extended period average precipitation38
hydrological drought brought water reserves available sources aquifers lakes reservoirs fall statistical average hydrological drought tends show slowly involves stored water used replenished like agricultural drought triggered loss rainfall instance kazakhstan recentlywhen awarded large amount money world bank restore water diverted nations aral soviet rule39 similar circumstances also place largest lake balkhash risk completely drying out40
