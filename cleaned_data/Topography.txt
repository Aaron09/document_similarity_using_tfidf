etymologyedit
also topographic history
term topography originated ancient greece continued ancient rome detailed description place word comes greek τόπος topos place γραφία graphia writing4 classical literature refers writing place places largely called local history britain europe general word topography still sometimes used original sense5
detailed military surveys britain beginning late eighteenth century called ordnance surveys term used 20th century generic topographic surveys maps6 earliest scientific surveys france called cassini maps family produced four generationscitation needed term topographic surveys appears american origin earliest detailed surveys united states made “topographical bureau army” formed 18127 became corps topographical engineers 18388 work national mapping assumed geological survey 1878 term topographical remained general term detailed surveys mapping programs adopted nations standard
20th century term topography started used describe surface description fields mapping broader sense used particularly medical fields neurology
objectivesedit
objective topography determine position feature generally point terms horizontal coordinate system latitude longitude altitude identifying naming features recognizing typical landform patterns also part field
topographic study made variety reasons military planning geological exploration primary motivators start survey programs detailed information terrain surface features essential planning construction major civil engineering public works reclamation projects
techniques topographyedit
variety approaches studying topography methods depend scale size area study accessibility quality existing surveys
direct surveyedit




surveying point germany


main article surveying
surveying helps determine accurately terrestrial threedimensional space position points distances angles using leveling instruments theodolites dumpy levels clinometers
work first topographic maps begun france giovanni domenico cassini great italian astronomer
even though remote sensing greatly sped process gathering information allowed greater accuracy control long distances direct survey still provides basic control points framework topographic work whether manual gisbased
areas extensive direct survey mapping program europe continental example compiled data forms basis basic digital elevation datasets usgs data data must often cleaned eliminate discrepancies surveys still forms valuable information largescale analysis
original american topographic surveys british ordnance surveys involved recording relief identification landmark features vegetative land cover
remote sensingedit
main article remote sensing
remote sensing general term geodata collection distance subject area
passive sensor methodologiesedit
main article aerial photography
main article satellite imagery
besides role photogrammetry aerial satellite imagery used identify delineate terrain features general landcover features certainly become part geovisualization whether maps systems falsecolor nonvisible spectra imaging also help determine land delineating vegetation landuse information clearly images visible colours spectrum
photogrammetryedit
main article photogrammetry
photogrammetry measurement technique coordinates points object determined measurements made photographic images taken starting different positions usually different passes aerial photography flight technique common points identified image line sight built camera location point object intersection rays triangulation determines relative threedimensional position point known control points used give relative positions absolute values sophisticated algorithms exploit information scene known priori example symmetries certain cases allowing rebuilding threedimensional coordinates starting position camera
active sensor methodologiesedit
satellite radar mapping major techniques generating digital elevation models similar techniques applied bathymetric surveys using sonar determine terrain ocean floor recent years lidar light detection ranging remote sensing technique uses laser instead radio waves increasingly employed complex mapping needs charting canopies monitoring glaciers
forms topographic dataedit
terrain commonly modelled either using vector triangulated irregular network gridded raster image mathematical models applications environmental sciences land surface represented modelled using gridded models civil engineering entertainment businesses representations land surface employ variant models geostatistics land surface commonly modelled combination signals smooth spatially correlated rough noise signal
practice surveyors first sample heights area produce digital land surface model form dlsm used visualize terrain drape remote sensing images quantify ecological properties surface extract land surface objects note contour data sampled elevation datasets dlsm dlsm implies elevation available continuously location study area represents complete surface digital land surface models confused digital surface models surfaces canopy buildings similar objects example case surface models produces using lidar technology several surfaces starting canopy actual solid earth difference surface models used derive volumetric measures height trees
survey dataedit
topographic survey information historically based upon notes surveyors derive naming cultural information local sources example boundary delineation derived local cadastral mapping historical interest field notes inherently include errors contradictions later stages production resolve
remote sensing dataedit
field notes remote sensing data aerial satellite photography example uninterpreted contain holes cloud cover example inconsistencies timing specific image captures modern topographic mapping includes large component remotely sensed data compilation process
topographic mappingedit
main article topographic




europe using elevation modeling


contemporary definition topographic mapping shows relief united states usgs topographic maps show relief using contour lines usgs calls maps based topographic surveys without contours planimetric maps
maps show contours also significant streams bodies water forest cover builtup areas individual buildings depending scale features points interest
officially topographic maps national surveys nations share many features often called topographic maps
existing topographic survey maps comprehensive encyclopedic coverage form basis much derived topographic work digital elevation models example often created remote sensing data existing paper topographic maps many government private publishers artwork especially contour lines existing topographic sheets basis specialized updated topographic maps9
topographic mapping confused geologic mapping latter concerned underlying structures processes surface rather identifiable surface features
digital elevation modelingedit
