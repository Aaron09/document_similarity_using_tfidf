discovery discrete inherited unitsedit
existence discrete inheritable units first suggested gregor mendel 1822–18845 1857 1864 brno czech republic studied inheritance patterns 8000 common edible plants tracking distinct traits parent offspring described mathematically combinations number differing characteristics original peas although term gene explained results terms discrete inherited units give rise observable physical characteristics description prefigured wilhelm johannsens distinction genotype genetic material organism phenotype visible traits organism mendel also first demonstrate independent assortment distinction dominant recessive traits distinction heterozygote homozygote phenomenon discontinuous inheritance
prior mendels work dominant theory heredity blending inheritance suggested parent contributed fluids fertilisation process traits parents blended mixed produce offspring charles darwin developed theory inheritance termed pangenesis greek whole genesis birth genos origin67 darwin used term gemmule describe hypothetical particles would reproduction
mendels work went largely unnoticed first publication 1866 rediscovered late 19th century hugo vries carl correns erich tschermak claimed reached similar conclusions research8 specifically 1889 hugo vries published book intracellular pangenesis9 postulated different characters individual hereditary carriers inheritance specific traits organisms comes particles vries called units pangenes pangens german darwins 1868 pangenesis theory
sixteen years later 1905 wilhelm johannsen introduced term gene4 william bateson genetics10 eduard strasburger amongst others still used term pangene fundamental physical functional unit heredity11
discovery dnaedit
advances understanding genes inheritance continued throughout 20th century deoxyribonucleic acid shown molecular repository genetic information experiments 1940s 1950s1213 structure studied rosalind franklin maurice wilkins using xray crystallography james watson francis crick publish model doublestranded molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated compelling hypothesis mechanism genetic replication1415
early 1950s prevailing view genes chromosome acted like discrete entities indivisible recombination arranged like beads string experiments benzer using mutants defective region bacteriophage 19551959 showed individual genes simple linear structure likely equivalent linear section dna1617

dnaedit
vast majority living organisms encode genes long strands deoxyribonucleic acid consists chain made four types nucleotide subunits composed fivecarbon sugar 2deoxyribose phosphate group four bases adenine cytosine guanine thymine2521
chains twist around form double helix phosphatesugar backbone spiralling around outside bases pointing inwards adenine base pairing thymine guanine cytosine specificity base pairing occurs adenine thymine align form hydrogen bonds whereas cytosine guanine form three hydrogen bonds strands double helix must therefore complementary sequence bases matching adenines strand paired thymines strand on2541

total complement genes organism cell known genome stored chromosomes chromosome consists single long helix thousands genes encoded2542 region chromosome particular gene located called locus locus contains allele gene however members population different alleles locus slightly different gene sequence
majority eukaryotic genes stored large linear chromosomes chromosomes packed within nucleus complex storage proteins called histones form unit called nucleosome packaged condensed called chromatin2542 manner stored histones well chemical modifications histone regulate whether particular region accessible gene expression addition genes eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved ensuring copied without degradation regions sorted daughter cells cell division replication origins telomeres centromere2542 replication origins sequence regions replication initiated make copies chromosome telomeres long stretches repetitive sequence ends linear chromosomes prevent degradation coding regulatory regions replication length telomeres decreases time genome replicated implicated aging process28 centromere required binding spindle fibres separate sister chromatids daughter cells cell division25182
prokaryotes bacteria archaea typically store genomes single large circular chromosome similarly eukaryotic organelles contain remnant circular chromosome small number genes25144 prokaryotes sometimes supplement chromosome additional small circles called plasmids usually encode genes transferable individuals example genes antibiotic resistance usually encoded bacterial plasmids passed individual cells even different species horizontal gene transfer29
whereas chromosomes prokaryotes relatively genedense eukaryotes often contain regions serve obvious function simple singlecelled eukaryotes relatively small amounts whereas genomes complex multicellular organisms including humans contain absolute majority without identified function30 often referred junk however recent analyses suggest although proteincoding makes barely human genome bases genome expressed term junk misnomer3
