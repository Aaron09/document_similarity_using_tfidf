renard series system preferred numbers dividing interval steps1 preferred numbers proposed 1877 french army engineer colonel charles renard234 system adopted 19495 form recommendation first published 19536 1954 evolved international standard renards system preferred numbers divides interval steps factor consecutive numbers renard series approximately constant rounding namely 10th 20th 40th root approximately respectively leads geometric sequence maximum relative error minimized arbitrary number replaced nearest renard number multiplied appropriate power application renard series numbers current rating electric fuses
basic series consists five rounded numbers powers fifth root rounded digits note renard numbers always rounded closest threedigit number theoretical geometric sequence



example design constraints assumed screws gadget placed apart resulting length would series preferred numbers
example nails lengths roughly produced application series would lead product repertoire long nails
finer resolution needed another five numbers added series original numbers ends series rounded multiple even finer grading needed series applied series usually rounded multiple values interpolate values rather powers 80th root rounded correctly table additional values written right values column named addl numbers higher interpolation order give rounder numbers
applications rounded values desirable either numbers normal series would imply unrealistically high accuracy integer value needed number teeth gear needs rounded versions renard series defined table rounded values differ less rounded counterparts shown bold

renard numbers repeat every 10fold change scale particularly wellsuited units makes difference whether renard numbers used metres millimetres would need appropriate number base avoid ending incompatible sets nicely spaced dimensions instance applied inches feet case inches feet root would desirable

renard sequences reduced subset taking every value series designated adding number slash4 example r10′′3 1…1000 designates series consisting every third value r′′10 series 1000 1000
