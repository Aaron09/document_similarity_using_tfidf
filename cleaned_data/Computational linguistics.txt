originsedit
computational linguistics often grouped within field artificial intelligence actually present development artificial intelligence computational linguistics originated efforts united states 1950s computers automatically translate texts foreign languages particularly russian scientific journals english3 since computers make arithmetic calculations much faster accurately humans thought short matter time could also begin process language4 computational quantitative methods also used historically attempted reconstruction earlier forms modern languages subgrouping modern languages language families earlier methods lexicostatistics glottochronology proven premature inaccurate however recent interdisciplinary studies borrow concepts biological studies especially gene mapping proved produce sophisticated analytical tools trustful results5
machine translation also known mechanical translation failed yield accurate translations right away automated processing human languages recognized complex originally assumed computational linguistics born name field study devoted developing algorithms software intelligently processing language data term computational linguistics first coined david hays founding member association computational linguistics international committee computational linguistics6 artificial intelligence came existence 1960s field computational linguistics became subdivision artificial intelligence dealing humanlevel comprehension production natural languagescitation needed
order translate language another observed understand grammar languages including morphology grammar word forms syntax grammar sentence structure order understand syntax also understand semantics lexicon vocabulary even something pragmatics language thus started effort translate languages evolved entire discipline devoted understanding represent process natural languages using computers7
nowadays research within scope computational linguistics done computational linguistics departments8 computational linguistics laboratories9 computer science departments10 linguistics departments1112 research field computational linguistics aims create working speech text processing systems others create system allowing humanmachine interaction programs meant humanmachine communication called conversational agents13

computational linguistics performed experts variety fields wide assortment departments research fields broach diverse range topics following sections discuss literature available across entire field broken four main area discourse developmental linguistics structural linguistics linguistic production linguistic comprehension
developmental approachesedit
language cognitive skill develops throughout life individual developmental process examined using number techniques computational approach human language development provide constraints make harder apply computational method understanding instance language acquisition human children largely exposed positive evidence14 means linguistic development individual evidence correct form provided evidence correct insufficient information simple hypothesis testing procedure information complex language15 provides certain boundaries computational approach modeling language development acquisition individual
attempts made model developmental process language acquisition children computational angle leading statistical grammars connectionist models16 work realm also proposed method explain evolution language history using models shown languages learned combination simple input presented incrementally child develops better memory longer attention span17 simultaneously posed reason long developmental period human children17 conclusions drawn strength neural network project created
ability infants develop language also modeled using robots18 order test linguistic theories enabled learn children might model created based affordance model mappings actions perceptions effects created linked spoken words crucially robots able acquire functioning wordtomeaning mappings without needing grammatical structure vastly simplifying learning process shedding light information furthers current understanding linguistic development important note information could empirically tested using computational approach
understanding linguistic development individual within lifetime continually improved using neural networks learning robotic systems also important keep mind languages change develop time computational approaches understanding phenomenon unearthed interesting information using price equation pólya dynamics researchers created system predicts future linguistic evolution also gives insight evolutionary history modernday languages19 modeling effort achieved computational linguistics would otherwise impossible
clear understanding linguistic development humans well throughout evolutionary time fantastically improved advances computational linguistics ability model modify systems affords science ethical method testing hypotheses would otherwise intractable
structural approachesedit
order create better computational models language understanding language’s structure crucial english language meticulously studied using computational approaches better understand language works structural level important pieces able study linguistic structure availability large linguistic corpora samples grants computational linguists data necessary models gain better understanding underlying structures present vast amount data contained single language cited english linguistic corpora penn treebank20 derived widelydifferent sources computer manuals transcribed telephone conversations corpus contains million words american english corpus primarily annotated using partofspeech tagging syntactic bracketing yielded substantial empirical observations related language structure21

theoretical approaches structure languages also developed works allow computational linguistics framework within work hypotheses understanding language myriad ways original theoretical theses internalization grammar structure language proposed types models15 models rules patterns learned increase strength frequency encounter15 work also created question computational linguists answer infant learn specific nonnormal grammar chomsky normal form without learning overgeneralized version getting stuck15 theoretical efforts like direction research early lifetime field study crucial growth field
structural information languages allows discovery implementation similarity recognition pairs text utterances22 instance recently proven based structural information present patterns human discourse conceptual recurrence plots used model visualize trends data create reliable measures similarity natural textual utterances22 technique strong tool probing structure human discourse without computational approach question vastly complex information present discourse data would remained inaccessible scientists
information regarding structural data language available english well languages japanese23 using computational methods japanese sentence corpora analyzed pattern lognormality found relation sentence length23 though exact cause lognormality remains unknown precisely sort intriguing information computational linguistics designed uncover information could lead important discoveries regarding underlying structure japanese could number effects understanding japanese language computational linguistics allows exciting additions scientific knowledge base happen quickly little room doubt
without computational approach structure linguistic data much information available would still hidden vastness data within single language computational linguistics allows scientists parse huge amounts data reliably efficiently creating possibility discoveries unlike seen approaches
