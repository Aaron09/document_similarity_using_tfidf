valves bivalve shell held together hinge ligament composed keratinised proteins tensilium resilium different groups bivalves ligament internal external position main function ligament well joining valves together passively cause shell open shell actively closed using adductor muscle muscles attached inner surface valves position muscles often clearly visible inside empty valves circular oval muscle scars along hinge line shell cases number hinge teeth prevent valves moving laterally relative another arrangement teeth often important identifying bivalves16
nervous systemedit
sedentary habits bivalves meant general nervous system less complex molluscs animals brain nervous system consists nerve network series paired ganglia primitive bivalves cerebropleural ganglia either side oesophagus cerebral ganglia control sensory organs pleural ganglia supply nerves mantle cavity pedal ganglia control foot base visceral ganglia quite large swimming bivalves posterior adductor muscle17 ganglia connected cerebropleural ganglia nerve fibres bivalves long siphons also siphonal ganglia control them17
sensesedit
sensory organs bivalves well developed largely located posterior mantle margins organs usually mechanoreceptors chemoreceptors cases located short tentacles chemoreceptor cells taste water sensitive touch typically found near siphons species fringe entire mantle cavity18 osphradium patch sensory cells located posterior adductor muscle serve taste water measure turbidity probably homologous structure name found snails slugs19 statocysts within organism help bivalve sense correct orientation statocyst consists small lined sensory cilia detect movement mineral mass statolith gravity2021 order anomalodesmata inhalant siphon surrounded vibrationsensitive tentacles detecting prey22

bivalves open circulatory system bathes organs hemolymph heart three chambers auricles receiving blood gills single ventricle ventricle muscular pumps hemolymph aorta rest body bivalves single aorta also second usually smaller aorta serving hind parts animal25
oxygen absorbed hemolymph gills provide primary respiratory surface gills hang mantle cavity wall provides secondary respiratory surface well supplied capillaries species gills subclass anomalodesmata wall mantle cavity organ involved respiration bivalves adapted tidal environments survive several hours water closing shells tightly freshwater species exposed gape shell slightly exchange take place26
hemolymph usually lacks respiratory pigment although members families arcidae limidae known possess haemoglobin dissolved directly serum20 carnivorous genus poromya hemolymph amoebocytes containing haemoglobin pigment27
digestive systemedit
modes feedingedit
bivalves filter feeders using gills capture particulate food phytoplankton water protobranchs feed different scraping detritus seabed original mode feeding used bivalves gills became adapted filter feeding primitive bivalves hold substratum pair tentacles edge mouth single palp flap tentacles covered mucus traps food cilia transport particles back palps sort particles rejecting unsuitable large digest conveying others mouth20
filibranchia eulamellibranchia water drawn shell posterior ventral surface animal passes upwards gills doubles back expelled intake burrowing species elongated retractable siphons reaching seabed inhalant exhalant streams water gills filterfeeding bivalves known ctenidia become highly modified increase ability capture food example cilia gills originally served remove unwanted sediment become adapted capture food particles transport steady stream mucus mouth filaments gills also much longer primitive bivalves folded create groove food transported structure gills varies considerably serve useful means classifying bivalves groups28
bivalves granular poromya poromya granulata carnivorous eating much larger prey tiny microalgae consumed bivalves animals gills relatively small form perforated barrier separating main mantle cavity smaller chamber water exhaled muscles draw water inhalant siphon modified cowlshaped organ sucking small crustaceans worms time siphon retracted quickly inverted bringing prey within reach mouth modified large food particles digested27
unusual genus entovalva endosymbiotic found oesophagus cucumbers mantle folds completely surround small valves cucumber sucks sediment bivalve allows water pass gills extracts fine organic particles prevent swept away attaches byssal threads hosts throat cucumber unharmed29
digestive tractedit
digestive tract typical bivalves consists oesophagus stomach intestine number digestive glands open stomach often pair diverticula secrete enzymes digest food stomach also include cells phagocytose food particles digest intracellularly filterfeeding bivalves elongated solidified mucus referred crystalline style projects stomach associated cilia cause style rotate winding stream foodcontaining mucus mouth churning stomach contents constant motion propels food particles sorting region rear stomach distributes smaller particles digestive glands heavier particles intestine30 waste material consolidated rectum voided pellets exhalent water stream anal pore feeding digestion synchronized diurnal tidal cycles31
carnivorous bivalves greatly reduced style chitinous gizzard helps grind food digestion ways similar filterfeeding bivalves20
excretory systemedit
like molluscs excretory organs bivalves pair nephridia consists long looped glandular tube opens body cavity beneath heart bladder store urine pericardial glands either line auricles heart attach pericardium serve extra filtration organs metabolic waste voided bladders pair openings near front upper part mantle cavity joins stream exhalant water32
reproduction developmentedit
sexes usually separate bivalves hermaphroditism known gonads located close intestines either open nephridia separate pore mantle cavity33 ripe gonads male females release sperm eggs water column spawning take place continually triggered environmental factors length water temperature presence sperm water species dribble spawners others release gametes batches mass spawning events sometimes take place bivalves area synchronise release spawn34
fertilization usually external typically short stage lasts hours days eggs hatch trochophore larvae later develop veliger larvae settle seabed undergo metamorphosis juveniles sometimes example case oysters known spat33 species genus lasaea females draw water containing sperm inhalant siphons fertilization takes place inside female species brood young inside mantle cavity eventually releasing water column veliger larvae crawlaway juveniles35
bivalve larvae hatch eggs water column feed diatoms phytoplankton temperate regions species lecithotrophic depending nutrients stored yolk main energy source lipids longer period larva first feeds larger yolk need reproductive cost producing energyrich eggs high usually smaller number example baltic tellin macoma balthica produces highenergy eggs larvae hatching rely energy reserves feed four days become dstage larvae first develop hinged dshaped valves larvae relatively small dispersal potential settling common mussel mytilus edulis produces times many eggs hatch larvae soon need feed survive grow disperse widely remain planktonic much longer time36
freshwater bivalves order unionoida different lifecycle sperm drawn females gills inhalant water internal fertilization takes place eggs hatch glochidia larvae develop within females shell later released attach parasitically gills fins fish host several weeks drop host undergo metamorphosis develop juveniles substrate advantage molluscs disperse upstream along temporary hosts rather constantly swept downstream water flow37
species freshwater mussel family unionidae commonly known pocketbook mussels evolved unusual reproductive strategy females mantle protrudes shell develops imitation small fish complete fishlike markings false eyes decoy moves current attracts attention real fish fish decoy prey others conspecific approach closer look mussel releases huge numbers larvae gills dousing inquisitive fish tiny parasitic young glochidia larvae drawn fishs gills attach trigger tissue response forms small cyst around larva larvae feed breaking digesting tissue fish within cysts weeks release cysts fall stream juvenile molluscs fish relatively unharmed38

past centuries consensus existed bivalve phylogeny many classifications developed earlier taxonomic systems experts used single characteristic feature classifications choosing among shell morphology hinge type gill type conflicting naming schemes proliferated taxonomies based single organ systems widely accepted systems forward norman newell part treatise invertebrate paleontology114 employed classification system based general shell shape microstructures hinge configuration115 features hinge morphology dentition mineralogy shell morphology shell composition change slowly time characteristics used define major taxonomic groups
since year 2000 taxonomic studies using cladistical analyses multiple organ systems shell morphology including fossil species modern molecular phylogenetics resulted drawing experts believe accurate phylogeny bivalvia116117118119120 based upon studies proposed classification system bivalvia published 2010 bieler carter coan121 2012 system adopted world register marine species worms classification bivalvia experts still maintain anomalodesmacea considered separate subclass whereas system treats order anomalodesmata within subclass heterodonta molecular phylogenetic work continues clarifying bivalvia closely related thus refining classification122123
