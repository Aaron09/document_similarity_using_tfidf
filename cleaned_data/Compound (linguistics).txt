finnish although theoretically limit length compound words words consisting three components rare even less three components look mysterious nonfinnish hätäuloskäytävä emergency exit internet folklore sometimes suggests lentokonesuihkuturbiinimoottoriapumekaanikkoaliupseerioppilas airplane turbine engine auxiliary mechanic noncommissioned officer student longest word finnish evidence actually used scant anecdotal best1
compounds rather long translating technical documents english language since lengths words theoretically unlimited especially chemical terminology example translating english technical document swedish term motion estimation search range settings directly translated rörelseuppskattningssökintervallsinställningar though reality word would likely divided sökintervallsinställningar rörelseuppskattning search range settings motion estimation
