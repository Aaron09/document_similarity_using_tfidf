architectureedit
eclipse uses plugins provide functionality within runtime system runtime system based equinox implementation osgi core framework specification42
addition allowing eclipse platform extended using programming languages python plugin framework allows eclipse platform work typesetting languages like latex43 networking applications telnet database management systems plugin architecture supports writing desired extension environment configuration management java support provided eclipse support version control systems provided thirdparty plugins
exception small runtime kernel everything eclipse plugin thus every plugin developed integrates eclipse plugins respect features created equalcitation needed eclipse provides plugins wide variety features third parties using free commercial models examples plugins include unified modeling language sequence diagrams plugin explorer many
eclipse includes eclipse java development tools offering builtin java incremental compiler full model java source files allows advanced refactoring techniques code analysis also makes workspace case metadata flat filespace allowing external file modifications long corresponding workspace resource refreshed afterward
eclipse implements graphical control elements java toolkit called standard widget toolkit whereas java applications java standard abstract window toolkit swing eclipses user interface also uses intermediate graphical user interface layer called jface simplifies construction applications based eclipse made wayland google summer code gsoc project 201444
2017update language packs developed babel project provide translations natural languages5
rich client platformedit
eclipse provides rich client platform developing general purpose applications following components constitute rich client platform

equinox osgi standard bundling framework
core platform boot eclipse pluginscitation needed
standard widget toolkit portable widget toolkit
jface viewer classes bring model view controller programming file buffers text handling text editors
eclipse workbench views editors perspectives wizards

examples rich client applications based eclipse
