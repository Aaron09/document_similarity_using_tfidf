history standardizationedit
main article history portable document format
adobe systems made specification available free charge 1993 early years popular mainly desktop publishing workflows competed variety formats djvu envoy common ground digital paper farallon replica even adobes postscript format
proprietary format controlled adobe released open standard july 2008 published international organization standardization 320001200878 time control specification passed committee volunteer industry experts 2008 adobe published public patent license 320001 granting royaltyfree rights patents owned adobe necessary make sell distribute compliant implementations9

technical foundationsedit
combines three technologies

subset postscript page description programming language generating layout graphics
fontembeddingreplacement system allow fonts travel documents
structured storage system bundle elements associated content single file data compression appropriate

postscriptedit
postscript page description language interpreter generate image process requiring many resources handle graphics standard features programming languages loop commands largely based postscript simplified remove flow control features like graphics commands lineto remain
often postscriptlike code generated source postscript file graphics commands output postscript code collected tokenized files graphics fonts document refers also collected everything compressed single file therefore entire postscript world fonts layout measurements remains intact
document format several advantages postscript

contains tokenized interpreted results postscript source code direct correspondence changes items page description changes resulting page appearance
version supports graphic transparency postscript
postscript interpreted programming language implicit global state instructions accompanying description page affect appearance following page therefore preceding pages postscript document must processed determine correct appearance given page whereas page document unaffected others result viewers allow user quickly jump final pages long document whereas postscript viewer needs process pages sequentially able display destination page unless optional postscript document structuring conventions carefully complied

technical overviewedit
file structureedit
file 7bit ascii file except certain elements binary content file starts header containing magic number version format pdf17 format subset carousel object structure format16 tree file consists primarily objects eight types17

boolean values representing true false
numbers
strings enclosed within parentheses contain 8bit characters
names starting forward slash
arrays ordered collections objects enclosed within square brackets
dictionaries collections objects indexed names enclosed within double pointy brackets
streams usually containing large amounts data compressed binary
null object

furthermore comments introduced percent sign comments contain 8bit characters
objects either direct embedded another object indirect indirect objects numbered object number generation number defined endobj keywords index table also called crossreference table marked xref keyword follows main body gives byte offset indirect object start file18 design allows efficient random access objects file also allows small changes made without rewriting entire file incremental update beginning version indirect objects also located special streams known object streams technique reduces size files large numbers small indirect objects especially useful tagged
file trailer introduced trailer keyword contains

dictionary
offset start crossreference table table starting xref keyword
endoffile marker

dictionary contains

reference root object tree structure also known catalog
count indirect objects crossreference table
optional information

layouts files nonlinear optimized linear optimized nonlinear files consume less disk space linear counterparts though slower access portions data required assemble pages document scattered throughout file linear files also called optimized optimized files constructed manner enables read browser plugin without waiting entire file download since written disk linear page order fashion19 files optimized using adobe acrobat software qpdf
imaging modeledit
basic design graphics represented similar postscript except transparency added
graphics deviceindependent cartesian coordinate system describe surface page page description matrix scale rotate skew graphical elements concept graphics state collection graphical parameters changed saved restored page description version graphics state properties important

current transformation matrix determines coordinate system
clipping path
color space
alpha constant component transparency

vector graphicsedit
postscript vector graphics constructed paths paths usually composed lines cubic bézier curves also constructed outlines text unlike postscript allow single path text outlines lines curves paths stroked filled clipping strokes fills color graphics state including patterns
supports several types patterns simplest tiling pattern piece artwork specified drawn repeatedly colored tiling pattern colors specified pattern object uncolored tiling pattern defers color specification time pattern drawn beginning also shading pattern draws continuously varying colors seven types shading pattern simplest axial shade type radial shade type
raster imagesedit
raster images called image xobjects represented dictionaries associated stream dictionary describes properties image stream contains image data less commonly raster image embedded directly page description inline image images typically filtered compression purposes image filters supported include general purpose filters

ascii85decode filter used stream 7bit ascii
asciihexdecode similar ascii85decode less compact
flatedecode commonly used filter based deflate algorithm defined 1951 deflate also used gzip file formats among others introduced groups predictor functions compact zlibdeflate compression predictor tiff specification predictors filters specification 2083
lzwdecode filter based compression groups predictor functions compact compression predictor tiff specification predictors filters specification
runlengthdecode simple compression method streams repetitive data using runlength encoding algorithm imagespecific filters
dctdecode lossy filter based jpeg standard
ccittfaxdecode lossless bilevel blackwhite filter based group group ccitt itut compression standard defined itut
jbig2decode lossy lossless bilevel blackwhite filter based jbig2 standard introduced
jpxdecode lossy lossless filter based jpeg 2000 standard introduced

normally image content embedded file allows image data stored external files external streams alternate images standardized subsets including pdfa pdfx prohibit features
textedit
text represented text elements page content streams text element specifies characters drawn certain positions characters specified using encoding selected font resource
fontsedit
font object description digital typeface either describe characteristics typeface include embedded font file latter case called embedded font former called unembedded font font files embedded based widely used standard digital font formats type compressed variant truetype beginning opentype additionally supports type variant components font described graphic operators
standard type fonts standard fontsedit
fourteen typefaces known standard fonts special significance documents

times regular italic bold bold italic
courier regular oblique bold bold oblique
helvetica regular oblique bold bold oblique

fonts sometimes called base fourteen fonts20 fonts suitable substitute fonts metrics available readers guaranteed available reader display correctly system installed21 fonts substituted embedded
encodingsedit
within text strings characters shown using character codes integers glyphs current font using encoding number predefined encodings including winansi macroman large number encodings east asian languages font builtin encoding although winansi macroman encodings derived historical properties windows macintosh operating systems fonts using encodings work equally well platform specify predefined encoding fonts builtin encoding provide lookup table differences predefined builtin encoding recommended truetype fonts22 encoding mechanisms designed type fonts rules applying truetype fonts complex
large fonts fonts nonstandard glyphs special encodings identityh horizontal writing identityv vertical used fonts necessary provide tounicode table semantic information characters preserved
transparencyedit
original imaging model like postscripts opaque object drawn page completely replaced anything previously marked location imaging model extended allow transparency transparency used objects interact previously marked objects produce blending effects addition transparency done means extensions designed ignored products written earlier specifications result files small amount transparency might view acceptably older viewers files making extensive transparency could viewed incorrectly older viewer without warning
transparency extensions based concepts transparency groups blending modes shape alpha model closely aligned features adobe illustrator version blend modes based used adobe photoshop time specification published formulas calculating blend modes kept secret adobe since published23
concept transparency group specification independent existing notions group layer applications adobe illustrator groupings reflect logical relationships among objects meaningful editing objects part imaging model
interactive elementsedit
files contain interactive elements annotations form fields video rich media
rich media term used describe file including interactive content embedded linked within file
interactive forms mechanism forms file format
