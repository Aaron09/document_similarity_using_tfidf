animal tissues grouped four basic types connective muscle nervous epithelial collections tissues joined structural units serve common function compose organs animals generally considered contain four tissue types manifestation tissues differ depending type organism example origin cells comprising particular tissue type differ developmentally different classifications animals
epithelium birds animals derived ectoderm endoderm small contribution mesoderm forming endothelium specialized type epithelium composes vasculature contrast true epithelial tissue present single layer cells held together occluding junctions called tight junctions create selectively permeable barrier tissue covers organismal surfaces come contact external environment skin airways digestive tract serves functions protection secretion absorption separated tissues basal lamina
connective tissueedit
main article connective tissue
connective tissues fibrous tissues made cells separated nonliving material called extracellular matrix matrix liquid rigid example blood contains plasma matrix bones matrix rigid connective tissue gives shape organs holds place blood bone tendon ligament adipose areolar tissues examples connective tissues method classifying connective tissues divide three types fibrous connective tissue skeletal connective tissue fluid connective tissue
muscle tissueedit
main article muscle tissue
muscle cells form active contractile tissue body known muscle tissue muscular tissue muscle tissue functions produce force cause motion either locomotion movement within internal organs muscle tissue separated three distinct categories visceral smooth muscle found inner linings organs skeletal muscle typically attached bones generates gross movement cardiac muscle found heart contracts pump blood throughout organism
nervous tissueedit
main article nervous tissue
cells comprising central nervous system peripheral nervous system classified nervous neural tissue central nervous system neural tissues form brain spinal cord peripheral nervous system neural tissues forms cranial nerves spinal nerves inclusive motor neurons
epithelial tissueedit
main article epithelium
epithelial tissues formed cells cover organ surfaces surface skin airways reproductive tract inner lining digestive tract cells comprising epithelial layer linked semipermeable tight junctions hence tissue provides barrier external environment organ covers addition protective function epithelial tissue also specialized function secretion excretion absorption epithelial tissue helps protect organs microorganisms injury fluid loss
functions epithelial tissue

cells bodys surface form outer layer skin
inside body epithelial cells form lining mouth alimentary canal protect organs
epithelial tissues help absorption water nutrients
epithelial tissues help elimination waste
epithelial tissues secrete enzymes andor hormones form glands

many kinds epithelium nomenclature somewhat variable classification schemes combine description cellshape upper layer epithelium word denoting number layers either simple layer cells stratified multiple layers cells however cellular features cilia also described classification system common kinds epithelium listed

plant anatomy tissues categorized broadly three tissue systems epidermis ground tissue vascular tissue

epidermis cells forming outer surface leaves young plant body
vascular tissue primary components vascular tissue xylem phloem transport fluid nutrients internally
ground tissue ground tissue less differentiated tissues ground tissue manufactures nutrients photosynthesis stores reserve nutrients

plant tissues also divided differently types

meristematic tissues
permanent tissues

meristematic tissuesedit
meristematic tissue consists actively dividing cells leads increase length thickness plant primary growth plant occurs certain specific regions tips stems roots regions meristematic tissue present cells tissues roughly spherical polyhedral rectangular shape thin cell walls cells produced meristem initially meristem cells grow mature characteristics slowly change become differentiated components region occurrence meristimatic tissues classified

apical meristem present growing tips stems roots increases length stem root form growing parts apices roots stems responsible increase length also called primary growth meristem responsible linear growth organ
lateral meristem meristem consist cells mainly divide plane cause organ increase diameter growth lateral meristem usually occurs beneath bark tree form cork cambium vascular bundles dicots form vascular cambium activity cambium results formation secondary growth
intercalary meristem meristem located permanent tissues usually present base node inter node leaf base responsible growth length plant increasing size internode result branch formation growth

cells meristematic tissues similar structure thin elastic primary cell wall made cellulose compactly arranged without intercellular spaces cell contains dense cytoplasm prominent nucleus dense protoplasm meristematic cells contains vacuoles normally meristematic cells oval polygonal rectangular shape
meristemetic tissue cells large nucleus small vacuoles inter cellular spaces
permanent tissuesedit
meristematic tissues take specific role lose ability divide process taking permanent shape size function called cellular differentiation cells meristematic tissue differentiate form different types permanent tissue types permanent tissues

simple permanent tissues
complex permanent tissues
special secretory tissues glandular

simple tissuesedit
group cells similar origin similar structure similar function called simple permanent tissue four types

parenchyma
collenchyma
sclerenchyma
epidermis botany

parenchymaedit
parenchyma para beside chyma filling loose unpacked bulk substance plants consists relatively unspecialised living cells thin cell walls usually loosely packed intercellular spaces found cells tissue tissue provides support plants also stores food situations parenchyma contains chlorophyll performs photosynthesis case called chlorenchyma aquatic plants large cavities present parenchyma give support float water parenchyma type called aerenchyma
collenchymaedit




cross section collenchyma cells


collenchyma greek word collen means chyma means infusion living tissue primary body like parenchyma cells thinwalled possess thickening cellulose water pectin substances pectocellulose corners number cells join together tissue gives tensile strength plant cells compactly arranged little intercellular spaces occurs chiefly hypodermis stems leaves absent monocots roots
collenchymatous tissue acts supporting tissue stems young plants provides mechanical support elasticity tensile strength plant body helps manufacturing sugar storing starch present margin leaves resist tearing effect wind
sclerenchymaedit
sclerenchyma greek word sclrenes means hard chyma means infusion tissue consists thickwalled dead cells cells hard extremely thick secondary walls uniform distribution lignin lignin deposition thick cell walls become strong rigid impermeable water
epidermisedit
entire surface plant consists single layer cells called epidermis surface tissue entire surface plant outer layer epidermis hence also called surface tissue epidermal cells relatively flat outer lateral walls cell often thicker inner walls cells forms continuous sheet without inter cellular spaces protects parts plant
complex permanent tissueedit
complex tissue consists type cells work together unit complex tissues help transportation organic material water minerals plants also known conducting vascular tissue common types complex permanent tissue

xylem wood
phloem bast

xylem phloem together form vascular bundles
xylemedit
xylem consists

tracheid
