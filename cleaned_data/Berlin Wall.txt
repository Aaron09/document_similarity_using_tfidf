erection inner german border
information inner german border eastern bloc emigration defection
early 1950s soviet approach controlling national movement restricting emigration emulated rest eastern bloc including east germany31 restrictions presented quandary eastern bloc states economically advanced open soviet union crossing borders seemed natural—especially prior border existed east west germany32
1952 demarcation lines east germany western occupied zones could easily crossed places33 april 1952 east german leaders soviet leader joseph stalin moscow discussions stalins foreign minister vyacheslav molotov proposed east germans introduce system passes visits west berlin residents territory east berlin stop free movement western agents stalin agreed calling situation intolerable advised east germans build border defenses telling demarcation line east west germany considered border—and border dangerous germans guard line defence lives34
consequently inner german border german states closed barbedwire fence erected border western eastern sectors berlin however remained open although traffic soviet western sectors somewhat restricted resulted berlin becoming magnet east germans desperate escape life also flashpoint tension united states soviet unioncitation needed
1955 soviets gave east germany authority civilian movement berlin passing control regime recognized west35 initially east germany granted visits allow residents access west germany however following defection large numbers east germans regime east german state legally restricted virtually travel west 195633 soviet east german ambassador mikhail pervukhin observed presence berlin open essentially uncontrolled border socialist capitalist worlds unwittingly prompts population make comparison parts city unfortunately always turn favour democratic east berlin36
berlin emigration loophole
closing inner german border officially 195236 border berlin remained considerably accessible administered four occupying powers33 accordingly berlin became main route east germans left west37 december 1957 east germany introduced passport reduced overall number refugees leaving eastern germany
unintended result drastically increasing percentage leaving west berlin well 195836 caught trying leave east berlin subjected heavy penalties physical barrier subway train access still available west berlin measures ineffective38 berlin sector border essentially loophole eastern bloc citizens could still escape36 million east germans left 1961 totalled approximately entire east german population38
important reason west berlin border closed earlier would much railway traffic east germany construction railway bypassing west berlin berlin outer ring commenced 1951 following completion railway 1961 closing border became practical proposition
brain drain

east german propaganda booklet published 1955 dramatically described serious nature flight republic

moral standpoint well terms interests whole german nation leaving political moral backwardness depravity

political depravity citizens whether young people workers members intelligentsia leave betray people created common labour republic offer american british secret services work west german factory owners junkers militarists leaving land progress morass historically outdated social order demonstrate political backwardness blindness
workers throughout germany demand punishment today leave german democratic republic strong bastion fight peace serve deadly enemy german people imperialists militarists40

1960 combination world massive emigration westward left east germany population working compared loss disproportionately heavy among professionals engineers technicians physicians teachers lawyers skilled workers direct cost manpower losses east germany corresponding gain west estimated billion billion east german party leader walter ulbricht later claiming west germany owed billion compensation including reparations well manpower losses38 addition drain east germanys young population potentially cost billion marks lost educational investment41 brain drain professionals become damaging political credibility economic viability east germany resecuring german communist frontier imperative42
