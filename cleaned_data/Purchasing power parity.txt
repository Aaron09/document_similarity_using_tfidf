purchasing power parity economic theory states exchange rate currencies equal ratio currencies respective purchasing power theories invoke purchasing power parity assume circumstances example longrun tendency would cost exactly number example dollars euros difference value market basket goods would cost directly purchase market basket goods dollars fall either currencys purchasing power would lead proportional decrease currencys valuation foreign exchange market
concept purchasing power parity allows estimate exchange rate currencies would order exchange purchasing power countries currencies using rate hypothetical currency conversions given amount currency thus purchasing power whether used directly purchase market basket goods used convert rate currency purchase market basket using currency observed deviations exchange rate purchasing power parity measured deviations real exchange rate value
exchange rates help costing exclude profits reckoned efficient methodology market exchange rates example suppose countries produce physical amounts goods different years since market exchange rates fluctuate substantially country measured currency converted countrys currency using market exchange rates country might inferred higher real country year lower inferences would fail reflect reality relative levels production countrys converted countrys currency using exchange rates instead observed market exchange rates false inference occur essentially controls different costs living price levels usually relative united states dollar thus enabling accurate depiction given nations level production

conceptedit
idea originated school salamanca 16th century developed modern form gustav cassel 191812 concept based price absence transaction costs official trade barriers identical goods price different markets prices expressed currency3
another interpretation difference rate change prices home abroad—the difference inflation rates—is equal percentage depreciation appreciation exchange rate
deviations parity imply differences purchasing power basket goods across countries means purposes many international comparisons countries gdps national income statistics need pppadjusted converted common units bestknown purchasing power adjustment geary–khamis dollar international dollar real exchange rate equal nominal exchange rate adjusted differences price levels purchasing power parity held exactly real exchange rate would always equal however practice real exchange rates exhibit short long deviations value example reasons illuminated balassa–samuelson theorem
marked differences purchasing power adjusted incomes converted market exchange rates4 example world banks world development indicators 2005 estimated 2003 gearykhamis dollar equivalent chinese yuan purchasing power parity5—considerably different nominal exchange rate discrepancy large implications instance converted nominal exchange rates capita india us19656 basis us71977 extreme instance denmarks nominal capita around us53242 figure us46602 line developed nations

purchasing power parity exchange rate serves main functions exchange rates useful making comparisons countries stay fairly constant week week change modestly year year second period years exchange rates tend move general direction exchange rate value knowing direction exchange rate likely shift long
measurementedit
exchangerate calculation controversial difficulties finding comparable baskets goods compare purchasing power across countries8citation needed
estimation purchasing power parity complicated fact countries simply differ uniform price level rather difference food prices greater difference housing prices also less difference entertainment prices people different countries typically consume different baskets goods necessary compare cost baskets goods services using price index difficult task purchasing patterns even goods available purchase differ across countries
thus necessary make adjustments differences quality goods services furthermore basket goods representative economy vary another americans bread chinese rice hence calculated using consumption base differ calculated using china base additional statistical difficulties arise multilateral comparisons usually case countries compared
various ways averaging bilateral ppps provide stable multilateral comparison cost distorting bilateral ones general issues indexing price indices reduce complexity single number equally satisfying purposes nevertheless ppps typically robust face many problems arise using market exchange rates make comparisons
example 2005 price gallon gasoline saudi arabia norway price 6279 significant differences price wouldnt contribute accuracy analysis despite variables contribute significant differences price comparisons made used variables overall formulation
comparisons made interval time proper account needs made inflationary effects
priceedit
although seem ppps price difference price applies individual commodities whereas applies general price level price true commodities also therefore true however discussing validity argue price need true exactly valid price true certain commodity price levels differ enough level predicted ppp10
purchasing power parity theory states exchange rate currency another currency equilibrium domestic purchasing powers rate exchange equivalent

hamburgers like japan similar worldwide


another example measure price underlies purchasing power parity index popularized economist compares prices burger mcdonalds restaurants different countries index presumably useful although based single consumer product typical relatively standardized product includes input costs wide range sectors local economy agricultural commodities beef bread lettuce cheese labor blue white collar advertising rent real estate costs transportation
theory price would hold take example canadian dollar significantly overvalued relative dollar according index unsustainable canadians would import macs travel consume thus putting upward demand pressure dollar virtue canadians buying dollars needed purchase usmade macs simultaneously placing downward supply pressure canadian dollar virtue canadians selling currency order dollars1112citation needed
alternative exchange rate adjustment would adjustment prices canadian mcdonalds stores compelled lower prices remain competitive either valuation difference reduced assuming perfect competition perfectly tradable good practice course perfectly tradable good also capital flows sustain relative demand canadian dollar difference price origins variety factors besides direct input costs government regulations product differentiation10
however emerging economies western fast food represents expensive niche product priced well price traditional staples—ie mainstream cheap meal west luxury import relates back idea product differentiation fact substitutes available confers market power mcdonalds example india costs local fast food like vada comparative signifies us13 additionally countries like argentina abundant beef resources consumer prices general cheap implied price

measurement issuesedit
addition methodological issues presented selection basket goods estimates also vary based statistical capacity participating countries international comparison program estimates based require disaggregation national accounts production expenditure cases income participating countries routinely disaggregate data categories
aspects comparison theoretically impossible unclear example basis comparison ethiopian laborer lives teff thai laborer lives rice teff commercially available thailand rice ethiopia price rice ethiopia teff thailand cannot determined general rule similar price structure countries valid comparison
levels also vary based formula used calculate price matrices different possible formulas include geksfisher gearykhamis superlative method advantages disadvantages
linking regions presents another methodological difficulty 2005 round regions compared using list 1000 identical items price could found countries selected least countries would region superior earlier bridging methods fully take account differing quality goods serve overstate basis poorer countries price indexing based assign poorer countries greater weight goods consumed greater shares richer countries
need adjustments gdpedit
exchange rate reflects transaction values traded goods countries contrast nontraded goods goods produced homecountry also currencies traded purposes trade goods services capital assets whose prices vary physical goods also different interest rates speculation hedging interventions central banks influence foreignexchange market
method used alternative correct possible statistical bias penn world table widely cited source adjustments associated penn effect reflects systematic bias using exchange rates outputs among countries
example value mexican peso falls half compared dollar mexican gross domestic product measured dollars also halve however exchange rate results international trade financial markets necessarily mean mexicans poorer half incomes prices measured pesos stay worse assuming imported goods essential quality life individuals measuring income different countries using exchange rates helps avoid problem
exchange rates especially useful official exchange rates artificially manipulated governments countries strong government control economy sometimes enforce official exchange rates make currency artificially strong contrast currencys black market exchange rate artificially weak cases exchange rate likely realistic basis economic comparison similarly exchange rates deviate significantly long term equilibrium speculative attacks carry trade exchange rate offers better alternative comparison
extrapolating ratesedit
since global estimates—such provided icp— calculated annually single year exchange rates years benchmark year need extrapolated22 using countrys deflator calculate countrys exchange rate geary–khamis dollars particular year calculation proceeds following manner23

difficultiesedit
number reasons different measures perfectly reflect standards living
range quality goodsedit
goods currency power purchase basket goods different types

local nontradable goods services like electric power produced sold domestically
tradable goods nonperishable commodities sold international market like diamonds

product falls category price currency exchange rate moving towards exchange rate conversely category products tend trade close currency exchange rate also penn effect
processed expensive products likely tradable falling second category drifting exchange rate currency exchange rate even value ethiopian currency three times stronger currency exchange rate wont three times much internationally traded goods like steel cars microchips nontraded goods like housing services haircuts domestically produced crops relative price differential tradables nontradables highincome lowincome countries consequence balassa–samuelson effect gives cost advantage labourintensive production tradable goods income countries like ethiopia high income countries like switzerland
corporate cost advantage nothing sophisticated access cheaper workers workers goes farther lowincome countries high relative differentials intercountry sustained longer would case otherwise another saying wage rate based average local productivity capita productivity factories selling tradable goods international markets achieve equivalent cost benefit comes nontraded goods sourced locally nearer pppexchange rate nominal exchange rate receipts paid cheaper factor production available factories richer countries
bhagwati–kravis–lipsey view provides somewhat different explanation balassa–samuelson theory view states price levels nontradables lower poorer countries differences endowment labor capital lower levels productivity poor countries labor relative capital marginal productivity labor greater rich countries poor countries nontradables tend laborintensive therefore labor less expensive poor countries used mostly nontradables nontradables cheaper poor countries wages high rich countries nontradables relatively expensive10
calculations tend overemphasise primary sectoral contribution underemphasise industrial service sectoral contributions economy nation
trade barriers nontradablesedit
price underlying mechanism behind weakened transport costs governmental trade restrictions make expensive move goods markets located different countries transport costs sever link exchange rates prices goods implied price transport costs increase larger range exchange rate fluctuations true official trade restrictions customs fees affect importers profits shipping fees according krugman obstfeld either type trade impediment weakens basis allowing purchasing power given currency differ widely country country10 cite example dollar london purchase goods dollar chicago certainly case
nontradables primarily services output construction industry nontradables also lead deviations prices nontradables linked internationally prices determined domestic supply demand shifts curves lead changes market basket goods relative foreign price basket prices nontradables rise purchasing power given currency fall country10
departures free competitionedit
linkages national price levels also weakened trade barriers imperfectly competitive market structures occur together pricing market occurs firm sells product different prices different markets reflection intercountry differences conditions demand side virtually demand pork islamic states supply side whether existing market prospective entrants product features suppliers instead already nearsaturated according krugman obstfeld occurrence product differentiation segmented markets results violations price absolute time shifts market structure demand occur invalidate relative ppp10
differences price level measurementedit
measurement price levels differ country country inflation data different countries based different commodity baskets therefore exchange rate changes offset official measures inflation differences makes predictions price changes rather price levels relative still useful concept however change relative prices basket components cause relative fail tests based official price indexes10
global poverty lineedit
global poverty line worldwide count people live international poverty line referred dollaraday line line represents average national poverty lines worlds poorest countries expressed international dollars national poverty lines converted international currency global line converted back local currency using exchange rates exchange rates include data sales high none poverty related items skews value food items necessary goods percent poor peoples consumption24 angus deaton argues indexes need reweighted poverty measurement need redefined reflect local poverty measures global measures weighing local food items excluding luxury items prevalent equal value localities25
