etymologyedit
word pixel first published 1965 frederic billingsley describe picture elements video images space probes moon mars5 billingsley learned word keith mcfarland link division general precision palo alto turn said know originated mcfarland said simply time circa 19636
word combination picture element word appeared variety magazine headlines 1932 abbreviation word pictures reference movies7 1938 used reference still pictures photojournalists6
concept picture element dates earliest days television example bildpunkt german word pixel literally picture point 1888 german patent paul nipkow according various etymologies earliest publication term picture element wireless world magazine 19278 though used earlier various patents filed early 19119
authors explain pixel picture cell early 197210 graphics image video processing often used instead pixel11 example used technical reference original
pixels abbreviated also unit measurement commonly used graphic design equivalent roughly 1⁄96 inch measurement used make sure given element display size matter screen resolution views it12
pixilation spelled second unrelated filmmaking technique dates beginnings cinema live actors posed frame frame photographed create stopmotion animation archaic british word meaning possession spirits pixies term used describe animation process since early 1950s various animators including norman mclaren grant munro credited popularizing it13

pixel generally thought smallest single component digital image however definition highly contextsensitive example printed pixels page pixels carried electronic signals represented digital values pixels display device pixels digital camera photosensor elements list exhaustive depending context synonyms include sample byte spot pixels used unit measure 2400 pixels inch pixels line spaced pixels apart
measures dots inch pixels inch sometimes used interchangeably distinct meanings especially printer devices measure printers density droplet placement14 example highquality photographic image printed 1200 inkjet printer15 even higher numbers 4800 quoted printer manufacturers since 2002 mean much terms achievable resolution16
pixels used represent image closer result resemble original number pixels image sometimes called resolution though resolution specific definition pixel counts expressed single number threemegapixel digital camera nominal three million pixels pair numbers display pixels side side bottom display therefore total number 640×480 307200 pixels megapixels
pixels color samples form digitized image jpeg file used page onetoone correspondence screen pixels depending computer displays image computing image composed pixels known bitmapped image raster image word raster originates television scanning patterns widely used describe similar halftone printing storage techniques
sampling patternsedit
convenience pixels normally arranged regular twodimensional grid using arrangement many common operations implemented uniformly applying operation pixel independently arrangements pixels possible sampling patterns even changing shape kernel pixel across image reason care must taken acquiring image device displaying another converting image data pixel format another
example




text rendered using cleartype



screens typically staggered grid green blue components sampled slightly different locations subpixel rendering technology takes advantage differences improve rendering text screens
vast majority color digital cameras bayer filter resulting regular grid pixels color pixel depends position grid
clipmap uses hierarchical sampling pattern size support pixel depends location within hierarchy
warped grids used underlying geometry nonplanar images earth space17
nonuniform grids active research area attempting bypass traditional nyquist limit18
pixels computer monitors normally square equal horizontal vertical sampling pitch pixels systems often rectangular unequal horizontal vertical sampling pitch oblong shape digital video formats diverse aspect ratios anamorphic widescreen formats digital video standard

resolution computer monitorsedit
computers pixels display image often abstract image represents resolution image called display resolution determined video card computer monitors also pixels display image native resolution pixel made triads number triads determining native resolution monitors beam sweep rate fixed resulting fixed native resolution monitors fixed beam sweep rate meaning native resolution instead resolutions equally well supported produce sharpest images possible user must ensure display resolution computer matches native resolution monitor
resolution telescopesedit
pixel scale used astronomy angular distance objects fall pixel apart detector infrared chip scale measured radians ratio pixel spacing focal length preceding optics focal length product focal ratio diameter associated lens mirror usually expressed units arcseconds pixel radian equals 180π3600≈206265 arcseconds diameters often given millimeters pixel sizes micrometers yields another factor 1000 formula often quoted s206pf

geometry color elements various displays phosphor dots color crts display bear relation pixels subpixels


many display imageacquisition systems various reasons capable displaying sensing different color channels site therefore pixel grid divided singlecolor regions contribute displayed sensed color viewed distance displays plasma displays singlecolor regions separately addressable elements come known subpixels19 example lcds typically divide pixel vertically three subpixels square pixel divided three subpixels subpixel necessarily rectangular display industry terminology subpixels often referred pixelsby basic addressable elements viewpoint hardware hence pixel circuits rather subpixel circuits used
digital camera image sensors singlecolor sensor regions example using bayer filter pattern camera industry known pixels like display industry subpixels
systems subpixels different approaches taken

subpixels ignored fullcolor pixels treated smallest addressable imaging element
subpixels included rendering calculations requires analysis processing time produce apparently superior images cases

latter approach referred subpixel rendering uses knowledge pixel geometry manipulate three colored subpixels separately producing increase apparent resolution color displays displays redgreenbluemasked phosphor areas dictated mesh grid called shadow mask would require difficult calibration step aligned displayed pixel raster crts currently subpixel rendering

megapixel million pixels term used number pixels image also express number image sensor elements digital cameras number display elements digital displays example camera makes 2048×1536 pixel image 3145728 finished image pixels typically uses extra rows columns sensor elements commonly said megapixels megapixels depending whether number reported effective total pixel count20
digital cameras photosensitive electronics either chargecoupled device complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor cmos image sensors consisting large number single sensor elements records measured intensity level digital cameras sensor array covered patterned color filter mosaic green blue regions bayer filter arrangement sensor element record intensity single primary color light camera interpolates color information neighboring sensor elements process called demosaicing create final image sensor elements often called pixels even though record channel green blue final color image thus three color channels sensor must interpolated socalled nmegapixel camera produces nmegapixel image provides onethird information image size could scanner thus certain color contrasts look fuzzier others depending allocation primary colors green twice many elements blue bayer arrangement
