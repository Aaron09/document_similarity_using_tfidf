planned versus command economiesedit
main article economic planning
planned economies held contrast command economies planned economy economic system government controls regulates production distribution prices etc11 command economy also type regulation necessarily substantial public ownership industry12 therefore command economies planned economies necessarily reverse
whereas economy organized topdown administrative model central authority decisions regarding investment production output requirements decided upon chain command little input lower levels advocates economic planning sometimes staunch critics command economies example leon trotsky believed chain command regardless intellectual capacity operated without input participation millions people participate economy understandrespond local conditions changes economy therefore would unable effectively coordinate economic activity13
although planned economies historically associated marxistleninist states soviet economic model argue soviet economic model actually constitute planned economy comprehensive binding plan guide production investment therefore distinction administrative command economy emerged accurate designation economic system existed former soviet union eastern bloc highlighting role centralized hierarchical decisionmaking absence popular control economy14 possibility digital planned economy explored chile creation project cybersyn alexander kharkevich head department technical physics kiev 19621516
another difference command economies usually authoritarian nature whereas economic planning general either participatory democratic authoritarian indicative planning form planning market economies directs economy incentivebased methods economic planning practiced decentralized manner different government authorities example predominately marketoriented mixed economies state utilizes economic planning strategic industries aerospace industry mixed economies usually employ macroeconomic planning microeconomic affairs left market price system

disadvantages economic planningedit
inefficient resource distribution surplus shortageedit
critics planned economies argue planners cannot detect consumer preferences shortages surpluses sufficient accuracy therefore cannot efficiently coordinate production market economy free price system intended serve purpose difficulty notably written economists ludwig mises friedrich hayek referred subtly distinct aspects problem economic calculation problem local knowledge problem respectively opponents central planning argue satisfy individuals constantly changing hierarchy needs ones possess particular individuals circumstances allowing knowledge needs power resources competing marketplace meet needs consumers efficiently phenomenon recognized spontaneous order additionally misallocation resources would naturally ensue redirecting capital away individuals direct knowledge circumventing markets coercive monopoly influences behavior ignoring market signals according tibor machan without market allocations made obedience supply demand difficult impossible funnel resources respect actual human preferences goals19
suppression economic democracy selfmanagementedit
economist robin hahnel notes even central planning overcame inherent inhibitions incentives innovation would nevertheless unable maximize economic democracy selfmanagement believes concepts intellectually coherent consistent mainstream notions economic freedom20
says hahnel combined democratic political system redone closer approximate best case version centrally planned economies doubt would performed better could never delivered economic selfmanagement would always slow innovate apathy frustration took inevitable toll would always susceptible growing inequities inefficiencies effects differential economic power grew central planning neither planners managers workers incentives promote social economic interest impeding markets final goods planning system enfranchise consumers meaningful ways central planning would incompatible economic democracy even overcome information incentive liabilities truth survived long propped unprecedented totalitarian political power20
