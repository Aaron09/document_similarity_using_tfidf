case folding case conversionedit
character sets developed computing upper lowercase letter encoded separate character order enable case folding case conversion software needs link together characters representing case variants letter characterencoding systems baudot code restricted letters usually represented uppercase variants
caseinsensitive operations said fold case idea folding character code table upper lowercase letters coincide conversion letter case string common practice computer applications instance make caseinsensitive comparisons many highlevel programming languages provide simple methods case conversion least ascii character
whether case variants treated equivalent varies depending computer system context example user passwords generally case sensitive order allow diversity make difficult break hand performing keyword search differentiating upper lower case might narrow search result much
