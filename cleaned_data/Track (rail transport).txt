railway track showing traditional features ballast part sleeper fixing mechanisms






section railway track foundation showing ballast formation layers layers slightly sloped help drainage
sometimes layer rubber matting shown improve drainage dampen sound vibration


notwithstanding modern technical developments overwhelmingly dominant track form worldwide consists flatbottom steel rails supported timber prestressed concrete sleepers laid crushed stone ballast
railroads heavy traffic continuously welded rails supported sleepers attached base plates spread load plastic rubber usually placed rail plate concrete sleepers used rail usually held sleeper resilient fastenings although spikes widely used north american practice much 20th century rail track used softwood timber sleepers jointed rails considerable extent track type remains secondary tertiary routes rails typically flat bottom section fastened sleepers spikes flat plate north america australia typically bullhead section carried cast iron chairs british irish practice london midland scottish railway pioneered conversion flatbottomed rail supposed advantage bullhead rail rail could turned reused surface become worn turned unworkable practice underside usually ruined fretting chairs
jointed rails used first contemporary technology offer alternative however intrinsic weakness resisting vertical loading results ballast becoming depressed heavy maintenance workload imposed prevent unacceptable geometrical defects joints joints also needed lubricated wear fishplate joint mating surfaces needed rectified shimming reason jointed track financially appropriate heavily operated railroads
timber sleepers many available timbers often treated creosote copperchromearsenate wood preservative prestressed concrete sleepers often used timber scarce tonnage speeds high steel used applications
track ballast customarily crushed stone purpose support sleepers allow adjustment position allowing free drainage

ballastless trackedit

ballastless highspeed track china


disadvantage traditional track structures heavy demand maintenance particularly surfacing tamping lining restore desired track geometry smoothness vehicle running weakness subgrade drainage deficiencies also lead heavy maintenance costs overcome using ballastless track simplest form consists continuous slab concrete like highway structure rails supported directly upper surface using resilient

however ballastless track high initial cost case existing railroads upgrade requires closure route long period wholelife cost lower reduction maintenance ballastless track usually considered high speed high loading routes short extensions require additional strength rail stations localised replacement exceptional maintenance difficulties example tunnels rubbertyred metros ballastless tracks1

alternative insulated joint audio frequency track circuits employed using tuned loop formed approximately rail part blocking circuit insulated joints unavoidable within turnouts
