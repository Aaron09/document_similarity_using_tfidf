herodotus wrote enormous city gelonus northern part scythia126

budini large powerful nation deep blue eyes bright hair city territory called gelonus surrounded lofty wall thirty furlongs τριήκοντα σταδίων built entirely wood houses place temples material temples built honour grecian gods adorned greek fashion images altars shrines wood even festival held every third year honour bacchus natives fall bacchic fury fact geloni anciently greeks driven factories along coast fled budini took abode still speak language half greek half scythian

herodotus classical historians listed quite number tribes lived near scythians presumably shared general milieu nomadic steppe culture often called scythian culture even though scholars difficulties determining exact relationship linguistic scythians partial list tribes includes agathyrsi geloni budini neuri
herodotus presented four different versions scythian origins

firstly scythians legend portrays first scythian king targitaus child skygod daughter dnieper targitaus allegedly lived thousand years failed persian invasion scythia around 1500 three sons fell four golden implements plough yoke battleaxe youngest succeeded touching golden implements without bursting fire sons descendants called herodotus royal scythians continued guard
secondly legend told pontic greeks featuring scythes first king scythians child hercules echidna
thirdly version herodotus said believed scythians came southern part central asia massagetae powerful tribe steppe nomads lived northeast persia forced westward
finally legend herodotus attributed greek bard aristeas claimed bachanalian fury northeast across scythia according scythians originally lived south rhipaean mountains conflict tribe called issedones pressed turn cyclopes scythians decided migrate westwards

persians peoples asia referred scythians living asia sakas herodotus iv64 describes scythians although figure different name

sacae scyths clad trousers heads tall stiff caps rising point bore country dagger besides carried battleaxe sagaris truth amyrgian western scythians persians called sacae since name gave scythians

strabo
century greekroman geographer strabo gave extensive description eastern scythians located central asia beyond bactria sogdiana127
strabo went list names various tribes believed scythian127 almost certainly conflated unrelated tribes eastern central asia
