completenessedit
laws listed define boolean algebra sense entail rest subject laws complementation together monotone laws suffice purpose therefore taken possible complete laws axiomatization boolean algebra every boolean algebra follows logically axioms furthermore boolean algebras defined models axioms treated section thereon
clarify writing laws boolean algebra cannot give rise consequences axioms rule model contrast list laws could boolean laws follow list moreover would models listed laws boolean algebras
axiomatization means even necessarily natural given attention whether axioms followed others simply chose stop noticed enough laws treated section axiomatizations intermediate notion axiom sidestepped altogether defining boolean directly tautology understood equation holds values variables definitions boolean algebra shown equivalent
duality principleedit
principle poset rinverse also poset
nothing magical choice symbols values boolean algebra could rename long consistently throughout would still boolean algebra albeit obvious cosmetic differences
suppose rename respectively would still boolean algebra moreover operating values however would identical original boolean algebra find behaving used vice versa still cosmetic differences show weve fiddling notation despite fact still using
addition interchanging names values also interchange names binary operations trace done product completely indistinguishable started might notice columns truth tables changed places switch immaterial
values operations paired leaves everything important unchanged pairs switched simultaneously call members pair dual thus dual dual duality principle also called morgan duality asserts boolean algebra unchanged dual pairs interchanged
change need make part interchange complement complement selfdual operation identity donothing operation copy input output also selfdual complicated example selfdual operation selfdual binary operation depends arguments composition selfdual operations selfdual operation example selfdual operation four arguments xyzt

three venn diagrams figure represent respectively conjunction disjunction complement





figure venn diagrams conjunction disjunction complement



conjunction region inside circles shaded indicate variables regions left unshaded indicate three combinations
second diagram represents disjunction shading regions inside either circles third diagram represents complement shading region inside circle
shown venn diagrams constants trivial respectively white dark neither containing circle however could circle boxes case would denote function argument returns value independently called constant function outputs concerned constants constant functions indistinguishable difference constant takes arguments called zeroary nullary operation constant function takes argument ignores unary operation
venn diagrams helpful visualizing laws commutativity laws seen symmetry diagrams binary operation commutative would symmetric diagram interchanging would effect reflecting diagram horizontally failure commutativity would appear failure symmetry
idempotence visualized sliding circles together noting shaded area becomes whole circle
first absorption x∧x∨y start diagram middle note portion shaded area common circle whole circle second absorption x∨x∧y start left diagram note shading whole circle results circle shaded since previous shading inside circle
double negation seen complementing shading third diagram shades circle
visualize first morgans ¬x∧¬y ¬x∨y start middle diagram complement shading region outside circles shaded right hand side describes result shaded region outside circle outside circle conjunction exteriors left hand side describes
second morgans ¬x∨¬y ¬x∧y works diagrams interchanged
first complement x∧¬x says interior exterior circle overlap second complement x∨¬x says everything either inside outside circle
digital logic gatesedit

lines left gate represent input wires ports value input represented voltage lead socalled activehigh logic represented voltage close zero ground represented voltage close supply voltage activelow reverses line right gate represents output port normally follows voltage conventions input ports
complement implemented inverter gate triangle denotes operation simply copies input output small circle output denotes actual inversion complementing input convention putting circle port means signal passing port complemented whether input output port
duality principle morgans laws understood asserting complementing three ports gate converts gate vice versa shown figure complementing ports inverter however leaves operation unchanged









generally complement eight subsets three ports either gate resulting sixteen possibilities give rise eight boolean operations namely number truth table eight oddbitout either four positions truth table sixteen binary boolean operations must leave eight operations even number truth tables constants binary operations ignore inputs four operations depend nontrivially exactly inputs namely remaining complement

concrete boolean algebrasedit
concrete boolean algebra field sets nonempty subsets given closed operations union intersection complement relative
aside historically required nonempty well exclude degenerate oneelement boolean algebra exception rule boolean algebras satisfy equations since degenerate algebra satisfies every equation however exclusion conflicts preferred purely equational definition boolean algebra rule oneelement algebra using equations— count negated equation hence modern authors allow degenerate boolean algebra empty
example power consisting subsets empty finite infinite even uncountable
example empty twoelement algebra shows concrete boolean algebra finite even consists subsets infinite seen every field subsets must contain empty hence smaller example possible degenerate algebra obtained taking empty make empty coincide
example finite cofinite sets integers cofinite omitting finitely many integers clearly closed complement closed union union cofinite cofinite union finite sets finite intersection behaves like union finite cofinite interchanged
example less trivial example point made example consider venn diagram formed closed curves partitioning diagram regions infinite points plane curve somewhere within diagram interior region thus infinite subset every point exactly region possible unions regions including empty obtained union empty regions obtained union regions closed union intersection complement relative therefore forms concrete boolean algebra finitely many subsets infinite forming concrete boolean algebra example arising case curves
