major historiographical debate latter years third republic concerns concept décadence decadence proponents concept argued french defeat 1940 caused regard innate decadence moral france101 notion décadence explanation defeat began almost soon armistice signed june 1940 marshal philippe pétain stated radio broadcast regime country ruin another said defeat punishment moral failures france rotted third republic102 1942 riom trial held bringing several leaders third republic trial declaring germany 1939 accusing enough prepare france
marc bloch book strange defeat written 1940 published posthumously 1946 argued french upper classes ceased believe greatness france following popular front victory 1936 allowed fall spell fascism defeatism bloch said third republic suffered deep internal generated bitter social tensions unstable governments pessimism defeatism fearful incoherent diplomacy hesitant shortsighted military strategy finally facilitated german victory june 1940103 french journalist andré géraud wrote name pertinax 1943 book gravediggers france indicted prewar leadership regarded total incompetence103
1945 concept décadence widely embraced different french political fractions discrediting rivals french communist party blamed defeat corrupt decadent capitalist third republic conveniently hiding sabotaging french effort nazisoviet pact opposition imperialist germany 1939–40
different perspective gaullists called third republic weak regime argued france regime headed strongman president like charles gaulle 1940 defeat could avoided104 power exactly started fifth republic group french historians centered around pierre renouvin protégés jeanbaptiste duroselle maurice baumont started type international history take renouvin called forces profondes profound forces influence domestic politics foreign policy105 however renouvin followers still followed concept décadence renouvin arguing french society third republic sorely lacking initiative dynamism baumont arguing french politicians allowed personal interests override sense general interest106
1979 duroselle published wellknown book entitled décadence offered total condemnation entire third republic weak cowardly degenerate107 even france concept décadence accepted englishspeaking world british historians taylor often described third republic tottering regime verge collapse108
notable example décadence thesis william shirers 1969 book collapse third republic french defeat explained result moral weakness cowardice french leaders108 shirer portrayed édouard daladier wellmeaning weak willed georges bonnet corrupt opportunist even willing deal nazis marshal maxime weygand reactionary soldier interested destroying third republic defending general maurice gamelin incompetent defeatist pierre laval crooked cryptofascist charles maurras shirer represented france’s influential intellectual preacher drivel marshal philippe pétain senile puppet laval french royalists paul reynaud petty politician controlled mistress countess hélène portes modern historians subscribe décadence argument take critical view frances pre1940 leadership without necessarily subscribing décadence thesis include talbot imlay anthony adamthwaite serge berstein michael carely nicole jordan igor lukes richard crane109
first historian denounce décadence concept explicitly canadian historian robert young 1978 book command france argued french society decadent defeat 1940 military factors moral failures third republics leaders done best difficult conditions 1930s110 young argued decadence existed impact french military planning readiness fight111112 young finds american reporters late 1930s portrayed calm united competent confident france praised french music literature theater fashion stressed french resilience pluck face growing nazi aggression brutality nothing tone content articles foretold crushing military defeat collapse june 1940113
