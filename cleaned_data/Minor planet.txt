distant minor planets umbrella term minor planets outer solar system

centaurs bodies outer solar system jupiter neptune unstable orbits gravitational influence giant planets therefore must come elsewhere probably outside neptune15

kuiper belt objects inside apparent population dropoff approximately

classical kuiper belt objects like makemake also known cubewanos primordial relatively circular orbits resonance neptune
