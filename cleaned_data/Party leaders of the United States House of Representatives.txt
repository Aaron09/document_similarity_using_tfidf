large extent minority leaders position 20thcentury innovation prior time congressional parties often relatively disorganized always evident functioned opposition floor leader decades went anything like modern twoparty congressional system emerged capitol hill official titles official leaders however beginning days congress various house members intermittently assumed role opposition leader scholars suggest representative james madison virginia informally functioned first minority leader first congress opposition treasury secretary alexander hamiltons fiscal policies17
early period usual neither major party grouping federalists democraticrepublicans official leader 1813 instance scholar recounts federalist minority members needed committee represent party comprising distinct minority coordinate actions already partisans cause18 1828 foreign observer house offered perspective absence formal party leadership capitol hill

found absolutely persons holding stations called england leaders either side house true certain members take charge administration questions certain others opposition questions obviously without concert among actual tacit nothing conceived less systematic completely desultory disjointed19

internal party disunity compounded difficulty identifying lawmakers might informally functioned minority leader instance seven fourteen speakership elections 1834 1859 least twenty different candidates field thirtysix competed 1839 ninetyseven 1849 ninetyone 1859 185520 many candidates competing speakership clear defeated lawmakers assumed mantle minority leader democratic minority 1861 1875 completely disorganized nominate candidate speaker seven congresses nominated five defeated candidates automatically looked leadership21
judgment political scientist randall ripley since 1883 candidate speaker nominated minority party clearly minority leader22 however assertion subject dispute december 1883 house elected democrat john carlisle kentucky speaker republicans placed nomination speakership warren keifer ohio speaker previous congress23 clearly keifer republicans minority leader discredited leader part speaker arbitrarily handed choice jobs close relatives handsome salaries24 keifer received empty honor minority nomination came sting naturally involves floor leadership deserted partisan associates career national figure terminated ingloriously25 representative thomas reed later became speaker assumed facto role minority floor leader keifers stead although keifer minoritys candidate speaker reed became acknowledged leader ever long served house remained conspicuous member party26
another scholar contends minority leader position emerged even 1883 democratic side serious caucus fights minority speakership nomination 1871 1873 indicating nomination carried vestige leadership27 republicans minority party nominated speaker series prominent lawmakers including exspeaker james blaine maine 1875 former appropriations chairman james garfield ohio 1876 1877 1879 exspeaker keifer 1883 hard believe house partisans would place speakership majority nominate office minority look legislative guidance27 case according observers respect exspeaker keifer
brief disagreement among historical analysts exact time period minority leadership emerged officially party position nonetheless seems safe conclude position emerged latter part 19th century period strong party organization professional politicians marked strong partisan attachments resilient patronagebased party organizations andhigh levels party voting congress28 plainly conditions conducive establishment highly differentiated house leadership structure29
