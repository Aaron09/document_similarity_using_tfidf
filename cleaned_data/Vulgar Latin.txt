simplification geminatesedit
reduction bisyllabic clusters identical consonants single syllableinitial consonant also typifies romance north west speziarimini results italian spanish provide clear illustrations siccus italian secco spanish seco cippus italian ceppo spanish cepo mittere italian mettere spanish meter
loss wordfinal medit
loss final process seems begun time earliest monuments latin language epitaph lucius cornelius scipio barbatus died around reads taurasia cisauna samnio cepit classical latin would taurāsiam cisaunam samnium cēpit captured taurasia cisauna samnium however explained different inscription simply fails note nasality final vowels like established custom writing consul
neutralization wedit
confusions show classical semivowel intervocalic partially merged become bilabial fricative classical semivowel became vulgar latin became allophone intervocalic position already century document eunus writes iobe iovem dibi divi16 romance varieties sound would develop notable exception betacist varieties hispanoromance represent phoneme allophone modern spanish well galician northern portuguese northern dialects catalan
consonant cluster simplificationedit
general many clusters simplified vulgar latin example reduced reflecting fact longer phonetically consonantal inscriptions mensis mesis month consul cosul consul15 descendants mensis include portuguese spanish catalan french meis modern french mois italian mese15 areas including much italy clusters ⟨ct⟩ assimilated second element ss15 thus inscriptions omnibus onibus dative plural indictione inditione indiction vixit bissit lived15 also threeconsonant clusters usually lost middle element example emptores imtores buyers
areas show development clusters however east italian octo otto eight nocte notte night romanian noapte15 contrast west turned french portuguese caused diphthongization previous vowel huit oito nuit noite spanish palatalized became oito ocho noite noche
also many clusters including simplified several groups seem never fully stableclarification needed facunt faciunt dropping resulted word parietem wall turning italian parete romanian păreteperete portuguese parede spanish pared french paroi french pareid17
cluster ⟨qu⟩ simplified instances find hypercorrective spelling quisquentis quiescentis person rests modern languages followed trend example latin become italian french quem became quien kjen spanish quem portuguese17 however survived front areas although french hence latin quattuor yields spanish cuatro kwatro portuguese quatro kwatru italian quattro kwattro french quatre katʀ spelling purely etymological17
spanish words consonant clusters syllablefinal position loanwords classical latin examples transporte tɾansˈporte transmitir tɾanzmiˈtir instalar instaˈlar constante konsˈtante obstante oβsˈtante obstruir oβsˈtɾwir perspectiva perspekˈtiβa istmo ˈistmo syllablefinal position cannot consonant dialects colloquial speech reflecting vulgar latin background realizations like trasˈporte tɾazmiˈtir istaˈlar kosˈtante osˈtante osˈtɾwir ˈizmo common many cases considered acceptable even formal speech

monophthongizationedit
many diphthongs begun monophthongization early presumed republican times become unstressed syllables phenomenon would spread stressed positions around century ad20 century instances spellings instead ⟨ae⟩21 ⟨oe⟩ always rare diphthong classical latin latin oinos regularly became unus became early imperial times thus find penam poenam20
however ⟨au⟩ lasted much longer monophthongized areas north central italy including rome retained vulgar latin survives modern romanian example aurum evidence french spanish monophthongization occurred independently languages20
loss distinctive length nearclose mergersedit
length confusions seem begun unstressed vowels soon generalized22 century sacerdos mentions peoples tendency shorten vowels word poets like commodian show inconsistencies long short vowels versification22 however loss contrastive length caused merger rest pairs remained distinct quality
also nearclose vowels became open varieties merged respectively23 result reflexes latin pira pear vēra true rhyme romance languages italian spanish pera vera similarly latin nucem walnut vōcem voice become italian noce voce portuguese
likely regional variation pronunciation romanian languages sardinian evolved differently24 sardinian corresponding short long vowels simply merged creating 5vowel system romanian front vowels evolved like western languages back vowels evolved sardinian southern italian languages southern corsican northernmost calabrian southern lucanian behave like sardinian pentavowel system case vegliote even partially western lucanian25 like romanian
phonologization stressedit
placement stress change classical vulgar latin words continued stressed syllable however loss distinctive length disrupted correlation syllable weight stress placement existed classical latin classical latin place accent predictable structure word longer vulgar latin stress become phonological property could serve distinguish forms otherwise homophones
lengthening stressed open syllablesedit
classical latin vowel length distinctions lost favor vowel quality system allophonic vowel quantity appeared sometime centuries around stressed vowels open syllables came pronounced long still keeping height contrasts rest became short example long venis ˈvɛːnis fori fɔːri cathedra ˈkaːtedra short vendo ˈvendo formas ˈformas26 allophonic length distinction persists italian however regions iberia gaul stressed vowels came pronounced long example porta ˈpɔːrta tempus ˈtɛːmpus26 many descendents several long vowels underwent form diphthongization extensively french five seven long vowels affected breaking

romance articlesedit
difficult place point definite article absent latin present romance languages arose largely highly colloquial speech arose seldom written daughter languages strongly diverged surviving texts early romance show articles fully developed

demonstrative used number contexts early texts ways suggest latin demonstrative losing force vetus latina bible contains passage tamen ille daemon sodalis peccati devil companion context suggests word meant little article need translate sacred texts originally koine greek definite article given christian latin incentive choose substitute aetheria uses ipse similarly mediam vallem ipsam middle valley suggesting weakening force14
another indication weakening demonstratives inferred fact time legal similar texts begin swarm praedictus supradictus forth meaning essentially aforesaid seem mean little gregory tours writes erat autem beatissimus anianus supradicta civitate episcopus blessed anianus bishop city original latin demonstrative adjectives longer felt strong specific enough14
less formal speech reconstructed forms suggest inherited latin demonstratives made forceful compounded ecce originally interjection behold also spawned italian ecco eccum contracted form ecce origin french ecce ille cist ecce iste ecce italian questo eccum istum quello eccum illum mainly tuscan codesto eccum tibi istum well eccu eccum spanish aquel portuguese aquele eccum ille spanish portuguese eccum spanish aquí portuguese aqui eccum portuguese acolá eccum illac aquém eccum inde romanian acest ecce iste acela ecce ille many forms
hand even oaths strasbourg demonstrative appears even places would clearly called later languages christian poblo christian people using demonstratives articles still considered overly informal royal oath century considerable variation exists romance vernaculars actual romanian articles suffixed noun adjective preceding members balkan sprachbund north germanic languages

french jaimerai aimer aimer love

periphrastic construction form late latin habere used future characteristic sardinian
