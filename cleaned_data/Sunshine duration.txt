sunshine hours redirects canadian show sunshine hour
sunshine duration sunshine hours climatological indicator measuring duration sunshine given period usually year given location earth typically expressed averaged value several years general indicator cloudiness location thus differs insolation measures total energy delivered sunlight given period
sunshine duration usually expressed hours year average hours first measure indicates general sunniness location compared places latter allows comparison sunshine various seasons location1 another oftenused measure percentage ratio recorded bright sunshine duration daylight duration observed period
important sunshine duration data characterize climate sites especially health resorts also takes account psychological effect strong solar light human wellbeing often used promote tourist destinations1

sunshine duration follows general geographic pattern subtropical latitudes northsouth highest sunshine values locations eastern sides subtropical high pressure systems associated largescale descent upperlevel tropopause many worlds driest climates found adjacent eastern sides subtropical highs create stable atmospheric conditions little convective overturning little moisture cloud cover desert regions nearly constant high pressure aloft rare condensation—like north africa southwestern united states western australia middle east—are examples sunny climates sunshine duration values high
major areas highest sunshine duration measured annual average central eastern sahara desert—covering vast mainly desert countries egypt sudan libya chad niger—and southwestern united states arizona california nevada4 city claiming official title sunniest world yuma arizona 4000 hours daylight time bright sunshine annually45 many climatological books suggest sunnier areas north africacitation needed belt encompassing northern chad tibesti mountains northern sudan southern libya upper egypt annual sunshine duration estimated 4000 hours also smaller isolated area sunshine maximum heart western section sahara desert around eglab massif chech along borders algeria mauritania mali 4000hour mark exceeded too6 places interior arabian peninsula receive 3600–3800 hours bright sunshine annually largest sunbaked region world 3000 hours yearly sunshine north africa sunniest month world december eastern antarctica almost hours bright daily7
conversely higher latitudes northsouth lying stormy westerlies much cloudier unstable rainy weather often lowest values sunshine duration annually temperate oceanic climates like northwestern europe western coast canada areas zealands south island examples cool cloudy humid climates cloudless sunshine duration values areas lowest sunshine duration annually mostly polar oceans well parts northern europe southern alaska northern russia areas near okhotsk cloudiest place united states cold alaska average days heavy overcast covering sky8 addition polar oceanic climates certain lowlatitude basins enclosed mountains like sichuan taipei basins sunshine duration 1000 hours year cool consistently sinks form fogs winds cannot dissipate9 tórshavn faroe islands among cloudiest places world yearly sunshine hours
