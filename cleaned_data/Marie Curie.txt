1897 daughter irène born support family curie began teaching école normale supérieure22 curies dedicated laboratory research carried converted shed next school physics chemistry22 shed formerly medical school dissecting room poorly ventilated even waterproof29 unaware deleterious effects radiation exposure attendant continued unprotected work radioactive substances school sponsor research would receive subsidies metallurgical mining companies various organizations governments222930
curies systematic studies included uranium minerals pitchblende torbernite also known chalcolite29 electrometer showed pitchblende four times active uranium chalcolite twice active concluded earlier results relating quantity uranium activity correct minerals must contain small quantities another substance active uranium2931 began systematic search additional substances emit radiation 1898 discovered element thorium also radioactive27 pierre increasingly intrigued work mid1898 invested decided drop work crystals join her2229
