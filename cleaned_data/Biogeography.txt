patterns species distribution across geographical areas usually explained combination historical factors speciation extinction continental drift glaciation observing geographic distribution species associated variations level river routes habitat river capture additionally science considers geographic constraints landmass areas isolation well available ecosystem energy supplies
periods ecological changes biogeography includes study plant animal species past andor present living refugium habitat interim living sites andor survival locales9 writer david quammen biogeography species also asks sometimes crucial not10
modern biogeography often employs geographic information systems understand factors affecting organism distribution predict future trends organism distribution11 often mathematical models employed solve ecological problems spatial aspect them12
biogeography keenly observed worlds islands habitats often much manageable areas study condensed larger ecosystems mainland13 islands also ideal locations allow scientists look habitats invasive species recently colonized observe disperse throughout island change apply understanding similar complex mainland habitats islands diverse biomes ranging tropical arctic climates diversity habitat allows wide range species study different parts world
scientist recognized importance geographic locations charles darwin remarked journal zoology archipelagoes well worth examination13 chapters origin species devoted geographical distribution
