phanerozoic biodiversity shown fossil record


fossil record appears show gaps mass extinctions becoming longer average background rates extinction decreasing phenomena could explained ways233

oceans become hospitable life last less vulnerable mass extinctions dissolved oxygen became widespread penetrated greater depths development life land reduced runoff nutrients hence risk eutrophication anoxic events marine ecosystems became diversified food chains less likely disrupted234235
reasonably complete fossils rare extinct organisms represented partial fossils complete fossils rarest oldest rocks paleontologists mistakenly assigned parts organism different genera often defined solely accommodate finds—the story anomalocaris example risk mistake higher older fossils often unlike parts living organism poorly conserved many superfluous genera represented fragments found superfluous genera appear become extinct quickly233

biodiversity fossil record number distinct genera alive given time whose first occurrence predates whose last occurrence postdates time236 shows different trend fairly swift rise slight decline devastating permian–triassic extinction event important factor swift rise present236
