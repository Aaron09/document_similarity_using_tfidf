general propertiesedit




plot proper inclination eccentricity numbered asteroids


large prominent families contain several hundred recognized asteroids many smaller objects either notyetanalyzed notyetdiscovered small compact families identified members asteroids main belt family members
reliably recognized families several tens less certain groupings asteroid families found main asteroid belt although several familylike groups pallas family hungaria family phocaea family smaller semimajor axis larger inclination main belt
family identified associated dwarf planet haumea1 studies tried find evidence collisional families among trojan asteroids present evidence inconclusive
origin evolutionedit
families thought form result collisions asteroids many cases parent body shattered also several families resulted large cratering event disrupt parent body vesta pallas hygiea massalia families cratering families typically consist single large body swarm asteroids much smaller families flora family complex internal structures satisfactorily explained moment several collisions region different times
method origin members closely matching compositions families notable exceptions families vesta family formed large differentiated parent body
asteroid families thought lifetimes order billion years depending various factors smaller asteroids lost faster significantly shorter solar systems relics early solar system decay families occurs slow dissipation orbits perturbations jupiter large bodies collisions asteroids grind small bodies small asteroids become subject perturbations yarkovsky effect push towards orbital resonances jupiter time relatively rapidly ejected asteroid belt tentative estimates obtained families ranging hundreds millions years less several million years compact karin family families thought contain small members basis determinations
supposed many families lost smaller mediumsized members leaving largest intact suggested example family remains metis amalthea pair evidence large number past families dispersed comes analysis chemical ratios iron meteorites show must least parent bodies large enough differentiated since shattered expose cores produce actual meteorites kelley gaffey 2000
identification members interlopersedit
interloper asteroid redirects meanings interloper interloper
orbital elements main belt asteroids plotted typically inclination eccentricity semimajor axis number distinct concentrations seen rather uniform background distribution generic asteroids concentrations asteroid families interlopers asteroids classified family members based socalled proper orbital elements spectroscopic properties distinct bulk family suggesting contrary true family members originate parent object fragmented upon collisional impact
descriptionedit




asteroid orbital elements standard keplerian left families indistinguishable proper elements right families visible


strictly speaking families membership identified analysing proper orbital elements rather current osculating orbital elements regularly fluctuate timescales tens thousands years proper elements related constants motion remain almost constant times least tens millions years perhaps longer
japanese astronomer kiyotsugu hirayama 1874–1943 pioneered estimation proper elements asteroids first identified several prominent families 1918 honor asteroid families sometimes called hirayama families particularly applies five prominent groupings discovered
hierarchical clustering methodedit
present computerassisted searches identified several tens asteroid families prominent algorithms hierarchical clustering method looks groupings small nearestneighbour distances orbital element space wavelet analysis method builds densityofasteroids orbital element space looks density peaks
boundaries families somewhat vague edges blend background density asteroids main belt reason number members even among discovered asteroids usually known approximately membership uncertain asteroids near edges
additionally interlopers heterogeneous background asteroid population expected even central regions family since true family members caused collision expected similar compositions interlopers principle recognised spectral properties match bulk family members prominent example ceres largest asteroid interloper family named ceres family gefion family
spectral characteristics also used determine membership otherwise asteroids outer regions family used vesta family whose members unusual composition
family typesedit
previously mentioned families caused impact disrupt parent body ejected fragments called cratering families terminology used distinguish various types groups less distinct less statistically certain prominent nominal families clusters term cluster also used describe small asteroid family karin cluster2 clumps groupings relatively members clearly distinct background juno clump clans groupings merge gradually background density andor complex internal structure making difficult decide whether complex group several unrelated overlapping groups flora family called clan tribes groups less certain statistically significant background either small density large uncertainty orbital parameters members
