1943 journal british astronomical association kenneth edgeworth hypothesized region beyond neptune material within primordial solar nebula widely spaced condense planets rather condensed myriad smaller bodies concluded outer region solar system beyond orbits planets occupied large number comparatively small bodies16 time time number wanders sphere appears occasional visitor inner solar system17 becoming comet
1951 paper astrophysics topical symposium gerard kuiper speculated similar disc formed early solar systems evolution think belt still existed today kuiper operating assumption common time pluto size earth therefore scattered bodies toward oort cloud solar system kuipers hypothesis correct would kuiper belt today18
