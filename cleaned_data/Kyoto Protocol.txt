analysts developed scenarios future changes emissions lead stabilization atmospheric concentrations ghgs57 climate models suggest lower stabilization levels associated lower magnitudes future global warming higher stabilization levels associated higher magnitudes future global warming figure opposite55
achieve stabilization global emissions must peak decline58 lower desired stabilization level sooner peak decline must occur figure opposite58 given stabilization level larger emissions reductions near term allow less stringent emissions reductions later59 hand less stringent near term emissions reductions would given stabilization level require stringent emissions reductions later on59
