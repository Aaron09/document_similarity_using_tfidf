etymologyedit
syllable anglonorman variation french sillabe latin syllaba koine greek συλλαβή syllabḗ greek pronunciation sylːabɛ̌ː συλλαβή means taken together referring letters taken together make single sound2
συλλαβή verbal noun verb συλλαμβάνω syllambánō compound preposition verb λαμβάνω lambánō take3 noun uses root appears aorist tense present tense stem λαμβάν formed adding nasal infix suffix end4
transcriptionedit
international phonetic alphabet period marks syllable breaks word astronomical ⟨æstrənɑmɪkəl⟩
practice however transcription typically divided words spaces often spaces also understood syllable breaks addition stress mark placed immediately stressed syllable stressed syllable middle word stress mark also marks syllable break example word understood ⟨ʌndəstʊd⟩
word space comes middle syllable syllable spans words used liaison french combination amis ⟨lez‿ami⟩ liaison also used join lexical words phonological words example ⟨ˈhɒt‿dɒɡ⟩

traditional chinese syllable structure


chinese syllable structure onset replaced initial semivowel liquid forms another segment called medial four segments grouped slightly different componentsexample needed

initial
optional onset excluding sonorants
final
medial nucleus final consonant

medial
optional semivowel liquid
nucleus
vowel syllabic consonant
coda
optional final consonant



many languages mainland southeast asia linguistic area chinese syllable structure expanded include additional optional segment known medial located onset often termed initial context rime medial normally semivowel reconstructions chinese generally include liquid medials modern reconstructions older versions many reconstructions middle chinese include medial contrast functions phonologically glide rather part nucleus addition many reconstructions middle chinese include complex medials medial groups phonologically rime rather onset combination medial rime collectively known final
linguists especially discussing modern chinese varieties terms final rimerhyme interchangeably historical chinese phonology however distinction final including medial rime including medial important understanding rime dictionaries rime tables form primary sources middle chinese result authors distinguish according definition

syllabificationedit
also syllabification phonotactics sonority hierarchy
syllabification separation word syllables whether spoken written languages actually spoken syllables basis syllabification writing weak correspondence sounds letters spelling modern english example written syllabification english based mostly etymological morphological instead phonetic principles english written syllables therefore correspond actually spoken syllables living language
phonotactic rules determine sounds allowed disallowed part syllable english allows complicated syllables syllables begin three consonants string splash occasionally many four prompts many languages much restricted japanese example allows chroneme coda theoretically consonant clusters onset composed consonant7

onset clusteredit
languages restrict onsets single consonant others allow multiconsonant onsets according various rules example english onsets possible possible greek however possible onsets contrarily classical arabic multiconsonant onsets allowed
null onsetedit
languages forbid null onsets languages words beginning vowel like english word impossible
less strange appear first languages allow syllables begin phonemic glottal stop sound middle english uhoh dialects double button represented english word begins vowel pronounced epenthetic glottal stop following pause though glottal stop phoneme language
languages make phonemic distinction word beginning vowel word beginning glottal stop followed vowel since distinction generally audible following another word however maltese polynesian languages make distinction hawaiian fire ʔahi tuna
hebrew arabic forbid empty onsets names israel abel abraham iran omar abdullah iraq appear onsets first syllable original hebrew arabic forms actually begin various consonants semivowel yisrāʔēl glottal fricative heḅel glottal stop ʔaḅrāhām ʔīrān pharyngeal fricative ʕumar ʕabduḷḷāh ʕirāq conversely arrernte language central australia prohibit onsets altogether syllables underlying shape vcc9
difference syllable null onset beginning glottal stop often purely difference phonological analysis rather actual pronunciation syllable cases pronunciation putatively vowelinitial word following another word particularly whether glottal stop inserted indicates whether word considered null onset example many romance languages spanish never insert glottal stop english time depending factors conversation speed cases suggests words question truly vowelinitial exceptions example standard german excluding many southern accents arabic require glottal stop inserted word following putatively vowelinitial word words said begin vowel german glottal stop arabic reason properties languages example glottal stop occur situations german consonant word hand arabic glottal stop occur situations classical saʔala asked raʔj opinion dˤawʔ light occurs alternations clearly indicative phonemic status classical kaːtib writer maktuːb written ʔaːkil eater maʔkuːl eaten

coda consists consonant cluster sonority decreases left right english word help called sonority profile14 english onset coda clusters therefore different onset strengths appear coda english word likewise coda ngths appear onset word
