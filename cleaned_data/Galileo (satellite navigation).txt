main objectivesedit
1999 different concepts three main contributors germany france italy11 galileo compared reduced joint team engineers three countries first stage galileo programme agreed upon officially 2003 european union european space agency system intended primarily civilian unlike militaryorientated systems united states russia glonass china beidou12 compass european system subject shutdown military purposes extreme circumstances like armed conflict12 available full precision civil military users countries contribute galileo project germany italy13
fundingedit
european commission difficulty funding projects next stage several allegedly annum sales projection graphs project exposed november 2001 cumulative projections year projected included previous years sales attention brought multibillioneuro growing error sales forecasts resulted general awareness commission elsewhere unlikely program would yield return investment previously suggested investors decisionmakers14better source needed january 2002 spokesman project stated result pressure economic difficulties galileo almost dead15
months later however situation changed dramatically european union member states decided important satellitebased positioning timing infrastructure could easily turn times political conflict16
european union european space agency agreed march 2002 fund project pending review 2003 completed 2003 starting cost period ending 2005 estimated billion required satellites planned number launched 2011 2014 system running civilian control 2019 final cost estimated billion including infrastructure earth constructed 2006 2007 plan private companies investors invest least twothirds cost implementation dividing remaining cost base open service available without charge anyone galileocompatible receiver encrypted higherbandwidth improvedprecision commercial service available cost early 2011 costs project initial estimates17
german aerospace center contributes largest portion galileo funds crucial development application system facilities earth observation center institute communication navigation neustrelitz18
tension united statesedit




december 2001 letter deputy secretary defense paul wolfowitz ministers states part uslobbying campaign galileo


galileo intended civilian gnss allows users access initially reserved highest quality signal military signal available civilian intentionally degraded selective availability changed president bill clinton signing policy directive 1996 turn selective availability since 2000 precision signal provided civilians military19
since galileo designed provide highest possible precision greater anyone concerned enemy could galileo signals military strikes allies weapons like missiles gnsss guidance frequency initially chosen galileo would made impossible block galileo signals without also interfering signals want lose gnss capability denying enemies gnss officials became especially concerned chinese interest galileo reported20
anonymous official claimed officials implied might consider shooting galileo satellites event major conflict galileo used attacks american forces21 stance galileo neutral technology available countries everyone first officials want change original plans galileo since reached compromise galileo different frequency allowed blocking jamming either gnss without affecting other22

reasons given developing galileo independent system position information made significantly inaccurate deliberate application universal selective availability military widely used worldwide civilian applications galileos proponents argued civil infrastructure including airplane navigation landing rely solely upon system vulnerability
2000 disabled president united states bill clinton late 2001 entity managing confirmed intend enable selective availability ever again23 though selective availability capability still exists september 2007 department defense announced newer satellites would capable implementing selective availability24 wave block satellites launched 2009 subsequent satellites stated support satellites replaced block iiia program cease optioncitation needed modernisation programme also contains standardised features allow galileo systems interoperate allowing receivers developed utilise galileo together create even precise gnss
cooperation united statesedit
june 2004 signed agreement united states european union agreed switch modulation known boc11 binary offset carrier allowing coexistence galileo future combined systems
european union also agreed address mutual concerns related protection allied national security capabilities12
first experimental satellites giovea giovebedit
first experimental satellite giovea launched december 2005 followed second test satellite gioveb launched april 2008 successful completion inorbit validation phase additional satellites launched november 2007 transport ministers involved reached agreement galileo operational 201325 later press releases suggest delayed 201426
funding governance issuesedit
mid2006 publicprivate partnership fell apart european commission decided nationalise galileo programme27
early 2007 decide system project said deep crisis lack public funds28 german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee particularly doubtful consortiums ability infighting time testbed satellite successfully launched
although decision reached july 200729 countries discussed cutting €548m 755m £370m unions competitiveness budget following year shifting funds parts financing move could meet part cost unions galileo satellite navigation system european union research development projects could scrapped overcome funding shortfall
november 2007 agreed reallocate funds agriculture administration budgets30 soften tendering process order invite companies31
april 2008 transport ministers approved galileo implementation regulation allowed €34bn released agriculture administration budgets32 allow issuing contracts start construction ground station satellites
june 2009 european court auditors published report pointing governance issues substantial delays budget overruns project stalling 2007 leading delays failures33
october 2009 european commission number satellites definitively planned plans order remaining later time also announced first signal would available 2013 time later billion budget 2006–2013 period considered insufficient34 2010 thinktank open europe estimated total cost galileo start years completion €222 billion borne entirely taxpayers original estimates made 2000 cost would billion billion borne taxpayers rest private investors35
november 2009 ground station galileo inaugurated near kourou french guiana36
launch first four inorbit validation satellites planned second half 2011 launch full operational capability satellites planned start late 2012
march 2010 verified budget galileo would available provide satellites 2014 funds committed bring constellation capacity37 paul verhoef satellite navigation program manager european commission indicated limited funding would serious consequences commenting point give idea would mean three weeks year satellite navigation reference proposed 18vehicle constellation
july 2010 european commission estimated delays additional costs project grow €15€17 billion moved estimated date completion 2018 completion system need subsidised governments €750 million year38 additional billion planned spent bringing system full complement satellites operational active spares1739
december 2010 ministers brussels voted prague czech republic headquarters galileo project40
january 2011 infrastructure costs 2020 estimated billion month wikileaks revealed berry smutny german satellite company ohbsystem said galileo stupid idea primarily serves french interests41 understood 2011 €500 million £440m would become available make extra purchase taking galileo within years operational satellites 2442
