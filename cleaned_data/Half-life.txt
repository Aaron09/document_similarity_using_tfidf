probabilistic natureedit




simulation many identical atoms undergoing radioactive decay starting either atoms left right number many halflives elapsed note consequence large numbers atoms overall decay regular predictable


halflife usually describes decay discrete entities radioactive atoms case work definition states halflife time required exactly half entities decay example radioactive atom halflife second half atom left second
instead halflife defined terms probability halflife time required exactly half entities decay average words probability radioactive atom decaying within halflife
example image right simulation many identical atoms undergoing radioactive decay note halflife exactly onehalf atoms remaining approximately random variation process nevertheless many identical atoms decaying right boxes large numbers suggests good approximation half atoms remain halflife
various simple exercises demonstrate probabilistic decay example involving flipping coins running statistical computer program234
