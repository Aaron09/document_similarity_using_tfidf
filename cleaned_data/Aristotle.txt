geology
quoted charles lyells principles geology

aristotle refers many examples changes constantly going insists emphatically great results must produce lapse ages instances particular cases lakes dried deserts length become watered rivers fertilized points growth nilotic delta since time homer shallowing palus maeotis within sixty years time alludes upheaving eolian islands previous volcanic eruption changes earth says slow comparison duration lives overlooked migrations people great catastrophes removal regions cause event forgotten

five elements
main article classical element
aristotle proposed fifth element aether addition four proposed earlier empedocles

earth cold corresponds modern idea solid
water cold corresponds modern idea liquid

fire corresponds modern ideas plasma heat
aether divine substance makes heavenly spheres heavenly bodies stars planets

four earthly elements natural place earthly tends toward center universe center earth water tends toward sphere surrounding center tends toward sphere surrounding water sphere fire tends toward lunar sphere moon orbits elements moved natural place naturally move back towards natural motion motion requiring extrinsic cause example water earthy bodies sink bubbles rise rain falls flame rises outside spheres heavenly fifth element manifested stars planets moves perfection circles
motion
main article potentiality actuality
aristotle defined motion actuality potentiality such37 aquinas suggested passage understood literally motion indeed understood active fulfillment potential transition toward potentially possible state actuality potentiality normally opposites aristotle commentators either suggest wording come erroneous addition definition critical understanding it38
causality four causes
main article four causes
aristotle suggested reason anything coming attributed four different types simultaneously active factors name aitia traditionally translated cause always refer temporal sequence might better translated explanation traditional rendering employed

material cause describes material something composed thus material cause table wood material cause rubber steel action mean domino knocks another domino
formal cause form arrangement matter tells thing thing determined definition form pattern essence whole synthesis archetype embraces account causes terms fundamental principles general laws whole macrostructure cause parts relationship known wholepart causation plainly formal cause idea existing first place exemplar mind sculptor second place intrinsic determining cause embodied matter formal cause could refer essential quality causation simple example formal cause mental image idea allows artist architect engineer create drawing
efficient cause primary source change consideration proceeds identifies makes made causes change changed suggests sorts agents nonliving living acting sources change movement rest representing current understanding causality relation cause effect covers modern definitions cause either agent agency particular events states affairs take dominoes time equal weighting first knocked causing second also fall
final cause telos purpose sake thing exists done including purposeful instrumental actions activities final cause purpose function something supposed serve covers modern ideas motivating causes volition need desire ethics spiritual beliefs

additionally things causes another causing reciprocally hard work causes fitness vice versa although function beginning change goal thus aristotle first suggested reciprocal circular causality relation mutual dependence influence cause upon effect moreover aristotle indicated thing cause contrary effects presence absence result different outcomes simply goal purpose brings event dominoes require someone something intentionally knock first domino cannot fall accord
aristotle marked modes causation proper prior causation accidental chance causation causes proper incidental spoken actual potential generic particular language refers effects causes actual effects assigned operating causes generic effects generic causes particular effects particular causes
optics
aristotle held accurate theories optical concepts philosophers second oldest written evidence camera obscura mozi found aristotles documentation device problemata aristotles apparatus contained dark chamber single small hole aperture allow sunlight enter aristotle used device make observations noted matter shape hole would still correctly displayed round object modern cameras analogous diaphragm aristotle also made observation distance aperture surface image increased image magnified39
chance spontaneity
according aristotle spontaneity chance causes things distinguishable types cause chance incidental cause lies realm accidental things spontaneous note spontaneous come chance better understanding aristotles conception chance might better think coincidence something takes place chance person sets intent thing take place result another thing intended taking place
example person seeks donations person find another person willing donate substantial however person seeking donations person donating purpose collecting donations purpose aristotle would call collecting donation particular donator result chance must unusual something happens chance words something happens time cannot chance
also specific kind chance aristotle names luck apply human beings sphere moral actions according aristotle luck must involve choice thus deliberation humans capable deliberation choice capable action cannot anything chance40

aristotle uses word memory basic abilities first actual retaining experience mnemonic imprint develop sensation second intellectual anxiety comes imprint impressed particular time processing specific contents abilities explained memory neither sensation thinking arises lapse time therefore memory past prediction future sensation present retrieval imprints cannot performed suddenly transitional channel needed located past experiences previous experience present experience

dreams
sleep
understanding aristotles views dreams first idea sleep must examined aristotle gives account explanation sleep sleep wakefulness70 sleep takes place result overuse senses71 digestion70 vital body including senses revitalized71 person asleep critical activities include thinking sensing recalling remembering function wakefulness71 since person cannot sense sleep also desire result sensation71 however senses able work sleep71 albeit differently person awake sleep person still sensory experiences70 also senses inactive sleep ones weary71
theory dreams
dreams involve actually sensing stimulus discussed senses work normally sleep71 dreams sensation still involved altered manner awake71 aristotle explains phenomenon occurs person stares moving stimulus waves body water70 look away stimulus next thing look appears moving wave like motion person perceives stimulus stimulus longer focus attention leaves impression70 body awake senses functioning properly person constantly encounters stimuli sense impressions left previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant71 however sleep impressions stimuli made throughout become noticed sensory experiences distract impressions made70 dreams result lasting impressions since impressions left exact stimuli dreams resemble actual experience occurred awake72
sleep person altered state mind70 aristotle compares sleeping person person overtaken strong feelings toward stimulus70 example person strong infatuation someone begin think person everywhere overtaken feelings70 person asleep senses acting awake results thinking like person influenced strong feelings70 since person sleeping suggestible state become easily deceived appears dreams70
asleep person unable make judgments awake70 senses functioning normally sleep unable help person judge happening dream70 turn leads person believe dream real70 dreams absurd nature senses able discern whether real not70 dreamer left accept dream lack choice judge
