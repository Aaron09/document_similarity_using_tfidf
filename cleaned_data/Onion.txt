irritationedit




onions emit certain compounds cause lacrimal glands eyes become irritated releasing tears






peeling onions


freshly onions often cause stinging sensation eyes people nearby often uncontrollable tears caused release volatile synpropanethialsoxide stimulates nerves creating stinging sensation7 produced chain reactions serve defence mechanism chopping onion causes damage cells releases enzymes called alliinases break amino acid sulfoxides generate sulfenic acids specific sulfenic acid 1propenesulfenic acid rapidly acted second enzyme lacrimatory factor synthase producing synpropanethialsoxide7 diffuses soon reaches eyes activates sensory neurons lacrimal glands produce tears dilute flush irritant39
irritation avoided cutting onions running water submerged basin water39 leaving root intact also reduces irritation onion base higher concentration sulphur compounds rest bulb40 refrigerating onions reduces enzyme reaction rate using blow away eyes often chops onions less experiences irritation41
