conceptsedit
skos vocabulary based concepts concepts units thought—ideas meanings objects events instances categories—which underlie many knowledge organization systems concepts exist mind abstract entities independent terms used label skos concept based class used represent items knowledge organization system terms ideas meanings systems conceptual organizational structure
conceptscheme analogous vocabulary thesaurus organizing concepts skos constrain concept within particular scheme provide declare complete scheme—there scheme consists certain members topconcept upper concepts hierarchical scheme
labels notationsedit
skos label string unicode characters optionally language tags associated concept preflabel preferred humanreadable string maximum language altlabel used alternative strings hiddenlabel used strings useful associate meant humans read
skos notation similar label literal string datatype like integer float date datatype even made notations typed literals datatypes skos reference notation useful classification codes strings recognizable words
documentationedit
documentation note properties provide basic information skos concepts concepts considered type skosnote provide specific kinds information property definition example contain full description subject resource specific note types defined skos extension desired query skosnote obtain notes including definitions examples scope history change editorial documentation
skos documentation properties refer several object types literal string resource node properties reference another document example using enables documentation metadata like creator creation date
specific guidance skos documentation properties found skos primer documentary notes
semantic relationsedit
skos semantic relations intended provide ways declare relationships concepts within concept scheme restrictions precluding concepts separate schemes discouraged likely overstate known schemes perhaps link inappropriately
property related simply makes association relationship concepts hierarchy generality relation implied properties broader narrower used assert direct hierarchical link concepts meaning unexpected relation broader means broader concept called b—hence broader narrower follows pattern
casual reader might expect broader narrower transitive properties skos declare rather properties broadertransitive narrowertransitive defined transitive superproperties broader narrower superproperties convention used declarative skos statements instead broader narrower relation used triple corresponding transitive superproperty also holds transitive relations inferred queried using superproperties
mappingedit
skos mapping properties intended express matching exact fuzzy concepts concept scheme another convention used connect concepts different schemes concepts relatedmatch broadmatch narrowmatch convenience meaning semantic properties related broader narrower previous section regarding meanings broader narrower
property relatedmatch makes simple associative relationship concepts concepts closely related generally used interchangeably exactmatch appropriate property exactmatch relations transitive unlike match relations closematch property indicates concepts sometimes used interchangeably transitive property
concept collectionsedit
