main processes involved embryonic development animals regional specification morphogenesis cell differentiation growth overall control timing explored evolutionary developmental biology
regional specification refers processes create spatial pattern ball sheet initially similar cells generally involves action cytoplasmic determinants located within parts fertilized inductive signals emitted signaling centers embryo early stages regional specification generate functional differentiated cells cell populations committed develop specific region part organism defined expression specific combinations transcription factors morphogenesis relates formation threedimensional shape mainly involves orchestrated movements cell sheets individual cells morphogenesis important creating three germ layers early embryo ectoderm mesoderm endoderm building complex structures organ development cell differentiation relates specifically formation functional cell types nerve muscle secretory epithelia differentiated cells contain large amounts specific proteins associated cell function growth involves overall increase size also differential growth parts allometry contributes morphogenesis growth mostly occurs cell division also changes cell size deposition extracellular materials control timing events integration various processes another least well understood area subject remains unclear whether animal embryos contain master clock mechanism
development plants involves similar processes animals however plant cells mostly immotile morphogenesis achieved differential growth without cell movements also inductive signals genes involved different control animal development

cell differentiationedit




notchdelta system neurogenesisslack essential biol 1412a


cell differentiation process whereby different functional cell types arise development example neurons muscle fibers hepatocytes liver cells well known types differentiated cell differentiated cells usually produce large amounts proteins required specific function gives characteristic appearance enables recognized light microscope genes encoding proteins highly active typically chromatin structure open allowing access transcription enzymes specific transcription factors bind regulatory sequences order activate gene expression12 example neurod transcription factor neuronal differentiation myogenin muscle differentiation hnf4 hepatocyte differentiation
cell differentiation usually final stage development preceded several states commitment visibly differentiated single tissue formed single type progenitor cell stem cell often consists several differentiated cell types control formation involves process lateral inhibition3 based properties notch signaling pathway4 example neural plate embryo system operates generate population neuronal precursor cells neurod highly expressed

initial stages human embryogenesis


sperm fuse process fertilization form fertilized zygote12 undergoes period divisions form ball sheet similar cells called blastula blastoderm cell divisions usually rapid growth daughter cells half size mother cell whole embryo stays size called cleavage divisions morphogenetic movements convert cell mass three layered structure consisting multicellular sheets called ectoderm mesoderm endoderm known germ layers process gastrulation cleavage gastrulation first regional specification events occur addition formation three germ layers often generate extraembryonic structures mammalian placenta needed support nutrition embryo13 also establish differences commitment along anteroposterior axis head trunk tail14

growth embryos mostly autonomous20 territory cells growth rate controlled combination genes active free living embryos grow mass external food supply embryos placenta extraembryonic yolk supply grow fast changes relative growth rate parts organisms help produce final overall anatomy
whole process needs coordinated time controlled understood master clock able communicate parts embryo controls course events timing depend simply local causal sequences events21
metamorphosisedit
developmental processes evident process metamorphosis occurs various types animal well known examples frog usually hatches tadpole metamorphoses adult frog certain insects hatch larva become remodeled adult form pupal stage
developmental processes listed occur metamorphosis examples especially well studied include tail loss changes tadpole frog xenopus2223 biology imaginal discs generate adult body parts drosophila melanogaster2425

plant development process structures originate mature plant grows studied plant anatomy plant physiology well plant morphology
plants constantly produce tissues structures throughout life meristems26 located tips organs mature tissues thus living plant always embryonic tissues contrast animal embryo early produce body parts ever life animal born hatches body parts point grow larger mature

growthedit
vascular plant begins single celled zygote formed fertilisation cell sperm cell point begins divide form plant embryo process embryogenesis happens resulting cells organize becomes first root forms shoot seed plants embryo develop seed leaves cotyledons embryogenesis young plant parts necessary begin life
embryo germinates seed parent plant begins produce additional organs leaves stems roots process organogenesis roots grow root meristems located root stems leaves grow shoot meristems located shoot28 branching occurs small clumps cells left behind meristem undergone cellular differentiation form specialized tissue begin grow root shoot growth meristem root shoot termed primary growth results lengthening root shoot secondary growth results widening root shoot divisions cells cambium29
addition growth cell division plant grow cell elongation occurs individual cells groups cells grow longer plant cells grow length cells side stem grow longer faster cells side stem bend side slower growing cells result directional growth occur plants response particular stimulus light phototropism gravity gravitropism water hydrotropism physical contact thigmotropism
plant growth development mediated specific plant hormones plant growth regulators pgrs ross 198330 endogenous hormone levels influenced plant cold hardiness dormancy metabolic conditions photoperiod drought temperature external environmental conditions exogenous sources pgrs externally applied rhizospheric origin
morphological variationedit
plants exhibit natural variation form structure organisms vary individual individual plants exhibit additional type variation within single individual parts repeated differ form structure similar parts variation easily seen leaves plant though organs stems flowers show similar variation three primary causes variation positional effects environmental effects juvenility
evolution plant morphologyedit
transcription factors transcriptional regulatory networks play roles plant morphogenesis evolution plant landing many novel transcription factor families emerged preferentially wired networks multicellular development reproduction organ development contributing complex morphogenesis land plants31
