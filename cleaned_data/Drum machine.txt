drum sound synthesisedit
difference early machines modern equipment sound synthesis rather digital sampling order generate sounds example snare drum maraca sound would typically created using burst white noise whereas bass drum sound would made using sine waves basic waveforms meant resulting sound close real instrument model tended unique character reason many early machines achieved certain cult status sought producers production modern electronic music notably roland tr80814
