system goes back proposal 1832 german mathematician carl friedrich gauss base system absolute units three fundamental units length mass time gauss chose units millimetre milligram second1 1874 extended british physicists james clerk maxwell william thomson electromagnetic units selection centimetre gram second naming cgs2
sizes many units turned inconvenient practical purposes example many everyday objects hundreds thousands centimetres long humans rooms buildings thus system never gained wide general outside field science starting 1880s significantly mid20th century gradually superseded internationally scientific purposes metre–kilogram–second system turn developed modern standard
since international adoption standard 1940s standard 1960s technical units gradually declined worldwide united states slowly elsewhere units today longer accepted house styles scientific journals textbook publishers standards bodies although commonly used astronomical journals astrophysical journal units still occasionally encountered technical literature especially united states fields material science electrodynamics astronomy continued usage units prevalent magnetism related fields primary unit tesla inconveniently large leading continued common gauss equivalent
units gram centimetre remain useful prefixed units within system especially instructional physics chemistry experiments match small scale tabletop setups however derived units needed ones generally used taught instead ones today example physics course might students record lengths centimetres masses grams force derived unit newtons usage consistent system
