natural fibers
main article natural fiber
natural fibers develop occur fiber shape include produced plants animals geological processes2 classified according origin

vegetable fibers generally based arrangements cellulose often lignin examples include cotton hemp jute flax ramie sisal bagasse banana plant fibers employed manufacture paper textile cloth dietary fiber important component human nutrition
wood fiber distinguished vegetable fiber tree sources forms include groundwood lacebark thermomechanical pulp bleached unbleached kraft sulfite pulps kraft sulfite also called sulphite refer type pulping process used remove lignin bonding original wood structure thus freeing fibers paper engineered wood products fiberboard
animal fibers consist largely particular proteins instances silkworm silk spider silk sinew catgut wool silk hair cashmere wool mohair angora sheepskin rabbit mink beaver
mineral fibers include asbestos group asbestos naturally occurring long mineral fiber minerals classified asbestos including chrysotile serpentine class belonging amphibole class amosite crocidolite tremolite anthophyllite actinolite short fiberlike minerals include wollastonite palygorskite
biological fibers also known fibrous proteins protein filaments consist largely biologically relevant biologically important proteins mutations genetic defects lead severe diseases instances collagen3 family proteins tendon muscle proteins like actin cell proteins like microtubules many others spider silk sinew hair

humanmade fibers
humanmade chemical fibers fibers whose chemical composition structure properties significantly modified manufacturing process4 manmade fibers consist regenerated fibers synthetic fibers
also fibre modification
semisynthetic fibers
semisynthetic fibers made materials naturally longchain polymer structure modified partially degraded chemical processes contrast completely synthetic fibers nylon polyamide dacron polyester chemist synthesizes lowmolecular weight compounds polymerization chainbuilding reactions earliest semisynthetic fiber cellulose regenerated fiber rayon5 semisynthetic fibers cellulose regenerated fibers
cellulose regenerated fibers
cellulose fibers subset manmade fibers regenerated natural cellulose cellulose comes various sources rayon tree wood fiber modal beech trees bamboo fiber bamboo seacell seaweed production fibers cellulose reduced fairly pure form viscous mass formed fibers extrusion spinnerets therefore manufacturing process leaves characteristics distinctive natural source material finished products
examples fiber type

rayon
bamboo fiber
lyocell brand rayon
modal using beech trees input
diacetate fiber
triacetate fiber

historically cellulose diacetate triacetate classified term rayon considered distinct materials
synthetic fibers
main article synthetic fiber
synthetic come entirely synthetic materials petrochemicals unlike manmade fibers derived natural substances cellulose protein6
fiber classification reinforced plastics falls classes short fibers also known discontinuous fibers general aspect ratio defined ratio fiber length diameter long fibers also known continuous fibers general aspect ratio 5007
metallic fibers
main article metallic fiber
metallic fibers drawn ductile metals copper gold silver extruded deposited brittle ones nickel aluminum iron also stainless steel fibers
carbon fiber
carbon fibers often based oxydized pyrolysis carbonized polymers like product almost pure carbon
silicon carbide fiber
silicon carbide fibers basic polymers hydrocarbons polymers carbon atoms replaced silicon atoms socalled polycarbosilanes pyrolysis yields amorphous silicon carbide including mostly elements like oxygen titanium aluminium mechanical properties similar carbon fibers
fiberglass
also glass fiberglass
fiberglass made specific glass optical fiber made purified natural quartz also manmade fibers come natural materials silica fiber made sodium silicate water glass basalt fiber made melted basalt
mineral fibers
mineral fibers particularly strong formed number surface defects asbestos common one8
polymer fibers

polymer fibers subset manmade fibers based synthetic chemicals often petrochemical sources rather arising natural materials purely physical process fibers made

polyamide nylon
polyester
phenolformaldehyde
polyvinyl chloride fiber vinyon
polyolefins olefin fiber
acrylic polyesters pure polyester fibers used make carbon fiber roasting oxygen environment traditional acrylic fiber used often synthetic replacement wool carbon fibers fibers noted resinbased fibers thermoplastic others melted
aromatic polyamids aramids twaron kevlar nomex thermally degrade high temperatures melt fibers strong bonding polymer chains
polyethylene eventually extremely long chains hmpe dyneema spectra
elastomers even used spandex although urethane fibers starting replace spandex technology
polyurethane fiber
elastolefin


coextruded fibers distinct polymers forming fiber usually coresheath sidebyside coated fibers exist nickelcoated provide static elimination silvercoated provide antibacterial properties aluminumcoated provide deflection radar chaff radar chaff actually spool continuous glass aluminum coated aircraftmounted high speed cutter chops spews moving aircraft confuse radar signals

microfibers
microfibers textiles refer subdenier fiber polyester drawn denier denier dtex measurements fiber yield based weight length fiber density known also fiber diameter otherwise simpler measure diameters micrometers microfibers technical fibers refer ultra fine fibers glass meltblown thermoplastics often used filtration newer fiber designs include extruding fiber splits multiple finer fibers synthetic fibers round crosssection special designs hollow oval starshaped trilobal latter design provides optically reflective properties synthetic textile fibers often crimped provide bulk woven woven knitted structure fiber surfaces also dull bright dull surfaces reflect light bright tends transmit light make fiber transparent
short andor irregular fibers called fibrils natural cellulose cotton bleached kraft show smaller fibrils jutting away main fiber structure9
