philosophical orientationedit
philosophy india aimed mainly spiritual liberation soteriological goals study mādhyamaka buddhist philosophy india peter deller santina writes6

attention must first drawn fact philosophical systems india seldom ever purely speculative descriptive virtually great philosophical systems india sāṅkhya advaitavedānta mādhyamaka forth preeminently concerned providing means liberation salvation tacit assumption systems philosophy correctly understood assimilated unconditioned state free suffering limitation could achieved fact overlooked often happens result propensity engendered formal occidental philosophy consider philosophical enterprise purely descriptive real significance indian buddhist philosophy missed

goal buddhist philosophy nirvana achieve needs investigate nature world indian buddhist philosophers teachings buddha meant taken faith alone confirmed logical analysis pramana world2 early buddhist texts mention person becomes follower buddhas teachings pondered wisdom gradual training also requires disciple “investigate” upaparikkhati “scrutinize” tuleti teachings7 buddha also expected disciples approach teacher critical fashion scrutinize actions words shown vīmaṃsaka sutta

buddha argued permanent self essence person makes means part person unchanging essential continuity means individual part person accounts identity person time27 opposition upanishadic concept unchanging ultimate self view eternal soul buddha held attachment appearance permanent self world change cause suffering main obstacle liberation
widely used argument buddha employed idea unchanging empiricist based observation five aggregates make person fact always changing argument way28

psychophysical processes skandhas impermanent
self would permanent




person five skandhas
self



argument requires implied premise five aggregates exhaustive account makes person else self could exist outside aggregates27
argument famously expounded anattalakkhana sutta according argument apparently fixed self merely result identification temporary aggregates changing processes making individual human view person convenient nominal designation certain grouping processes characteristics individual conceptual construction overlaid upon stream experiences like chariot merely conventional designation parts chariot together foundation argument empiricist based fact observe subject change especially everything observed looking inwardly meditation29
another argument nonself argument lack control30 based fact often seek change certain parts executive function mind finds certain things unsatisfactory attempts alter furthermore also based indian anti reflexivity principle states entity cannot operate control knife things finger point things means self could never desire change could buddha uses idea attack concept self argument could structured thus31

self existed would part person performs executive function controller
self could never desire changed antireflexivity principle
five kinds psychophysical element desire changed




person five skandhas
self



argument denies permanent controller person instead views person constantly changing processes include volitional events seeking change awareness desire change according mark siderits
buddhist mind occasion part person might perform executive function another occasion another part might would make possible every part subject control without part always fills role controller self occasions given part might fall controller side occasions might fall side controlled would explain possible seek change skandhas nothing skandhas32
noted norman richard gombrich buddha extended anatta critique brahmanical belief expounded brihadaranyaka upanishad self atman indeed whole world brahman3334 shown alagaddūpamasutta buddha argues individual cannot experience suffering entire world used example someone carrying burning grass sticks jeta grove monk would sense consider harmed action example buddha arguing direct experience entire world hence self cannot whole world sutta well soattā sutta buddha outlines wrong views self

wrong views unwise untrained person think body ‘this mine self’ think feelings perceptions volitions seen heard thought cognized reached sought considered mind sixth identify world self believe death shall become permanent eternal unchanging remain forever mine self’ wise welltrained person sees positions wrong worried something exist33

furthermore buddha argues world observed cause suffering brahman held ultimately blissful since cannot control world wish world cannot self idea cosmos self views rejected buddha along related monistic theory held everything oneness 1248 lokayatika sutta36 buddha also held understanding seeing truth notself unattachment hence cessation suffering ignorance true nature personality suffering
epistemologyedit
schools indian philosophy recognize various sets valid justifications knowledge pramāṇa many vedas providing access truth buddha denied authority vedas though like contemporaries affirmed soteriological importance proper understanding reality right view37 however understanding conceived primarily metaphysical cosmological knowledge knowledge arising cessation suffering human experience38 therefore buddhas epistemic project different modern philosophy primarily solution fundamental human spiritualexistential problem
buddhas epistemology compared empiricism sense based experience world senses3940 buddha taught empirical observation sense fields ayatanas proper verifying knowledge claims suttas stating everything exists sabbam sense spheres 3523 sabba sutta anyone attempts describe another unable lies beyond range42 sutta seems indicate buddha things noumena beyond epistemological reach avisaya43
furthermore kalama sutta buddha tells group confused villagers proper reason ones beliefs verification one’s personal experience experience wise denies verification stems personal authority sacred tradition anussava kind rationalism constructs metaphysical theories takka44 tevijja sutta buddha rejects personal authority brahmins none prove personal experience brahman buddha also stressed experience criterion verification truth passage majjhima nikaya mni265



monks speak known seen found

good monks instructed timeless doctrine realized verified leads goal understood intelligent



furthermore buddhas standard personal verification pragmatic salvific buddha belief counts truth leads successful buddhist practice hence destruction craving discourse prince abhaya mni392–4 buddha states pragmatic maxim saying belief accepted leads wholesome consequences45 tendency buddha true useful works called scholars rhys davids valléepoussin form pragmatism4647 however jayatilleke argues buddhas epistemology also taken form correspondence theory apannaka sutta elements coherentism buddha causally impossible something false lead suffering evil
buddha discouraged followers indulging intellectual disputation sake fruitless distracts goal awakening philosophy discussion pragmatic value liberation suffering seen important according scriptures lifetime buddha remained silent asked several metaphysical questions regarded basis unwise reflection unanswered questions avyākata regarded issues whether universe eternal noneternal whether finite infinite unity separation body self complete inexistence person nirvana death others buddha stated thinking imponderable acinteyya issues thicket views wilderness views contortion views writhing views fetter views aggivacchagotta sutta
explanation pragmatic suspension judgment epistemic epoché questions distract activity practical realizing enlightenment49 bring danger substituting experience liberation conceptual understanding doctrine religious faith according buddha dharma ultimate explanation metaphysical reality pragmatic teachings buddha used parables clarify point parable raft parable poisoned arrow50 dharma like raft sense pragmatic tool attaining nirvana purpose crossing purpose holding onto done discard raft also like medicine particulars injured poisoned arrow metaphysics matter removing curing arrow wound removing suffering sense buddha often called great physician goal cure human condition suffering first foremost speculate metaphysics51
said still clear resisting even refuting false slanted doctrine useful extricate interlocutor oneself error hence advance liberation witness buddhas confutation several doctrines nigantha nataputta purported sages sometimes large followings kula sutta sankha sutta brahmana sutta shows virtuous appropriate dialectics take place implication reasoning argument shouldnt disparaged buddhists
buddhas death buddhists dharmakirti went sayings buddha sound evidence equal perception inferencec
transcendenceedit
another possible reason buddha refused engage metaphysics ultimate reality nirvana devoid sensory mediation conception therefore language priori inadequate explain it52 thus buddhas silence indicate misology disdain philosophy rather indicates viewed answers questions understandable unenlightened52 dependent arising provides framework analysis reality based metaphysical assumptions regarding existence nonexistence instead imagining direct cognition phenomena presented mind yogic meditation
buddha earliest buddhists texts describes dharma sense truth beyond reasoning transcending logic sense reasoning subjectively introduced aspect unenlightened humans perceive things conceptual framework underpins cognitive process rather feature things really going beyond reasoning means context penetrating nature reasoning inside removing causes experiencing future stress result rather functioning outside system whole53
metaethicsedit
main article buddhist ethics
buddhas ethics based soteriological need eliminate suffering premise karma buddhist ethics termed eudaimonic goal wellbeing also compared virtue ethics approach began damien keown54 keown writes buddhist nirvana analogous aristotelian eudaimonia buddhist moral acts virtues derive value lead aspect nirvanic life
buddha outlined five precepts killing stealing sexual misconduct lying drinking alcohol followed disciples monastic various reasons buddha gave someone ethical
first universe structured someone intentionally commits misdeed karmic fruit result vice versa hence pragmatic point view best abstain negative actions bring forth negative results however important word intentionally buddha karma nothing else intentionvolition hence unintentionally harming someone create karmic results unlike jains believed karma quasiphysical element buddha karma volitional mental event richard gombrich calls ethicised consciousness’55
idea leads second moral justification buddha intentionally performing negative actions reinforces propagates mental defilements keep persons bound cycle rebirth interfere process liberation hence intentionally performing good karmic actions participating mental purification leads nirvana highest happiness perspective sees immoral acts unskillful akusala quest happiness hence pragmatic good
third metaethical consideration takes view notself natural desire suffering logical conclusion since self reason prefer welfare others ultimate grounding differentiation suffering someone elses instead enlightened person would work suffering tout court without thinking conventional concept persons56 according argument anyone selfish ignorance true nature personal identity irrationality
