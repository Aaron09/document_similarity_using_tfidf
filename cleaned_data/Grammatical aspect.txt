basic conceptedit
historyedit
indian linguist yaska century dealt grammatical aspect distinguishing actions processes bhāva action considered completed whole mūrta distinction imperfective perfective yaska also applied distinction verb versus action nominalcitation needed
grammarians greek latin languages also showed interest aspect idea enter modern western grammatical tradition 19th century study grammar slavic languages earliest term recorded oxford english dictionary dates 18533
modern usageedit
aspect often confused closely related concept tense convey information time tense relates time referent time commonly speech event aspect conveys temporal information duration completion frequency relates time action thus tense refers temporally aspect refers temporally aspect said describe texture time situation occurs single point time continuous range time sequence discrete points time whereas tense indicates location time
example consider following sentences eating eaten eating present tense indicated presenttense verb sentence since differ aspect conveys different information points view action pertains present
grammatical aspect formal property language distinguished overt inflection derivational affixes independent words serve grammatically required markers aspects example kiche language spoken guatemala inflectional prefixes mark incompletive completive aspect45 mandarin chinese aspect markers mark perfective durative stative durative progressive experiential aspects6 also marks aspect adverbs7 english marks continuous aspect verb coupled present participle perfect verb coupled past participle even languages mark aspect morphologically auxiliary verbs however convey distinctions adverbs syntactic constructions8

common aspectual distinctionsedit
fundamental aspectual distinction represented many languages perfective aspect imperfective aspect basic aspectual distinction slavic languages semantically corresponds distinction morphological forms known respectively aorist imperfect greek preterite imperfect spanish simple past passé simple imperfect french perfect imperfect latin latin perfectus meaning completed
essentially perfective aspect looks event complete action imperfective aspect views event process unfolding repeated habitual event thus corresponding progressivecontinuous aspect events shortterm duration habitual aspect longer terms events short durations past distinction often coincides distinction english language simple past compared progressive xing compare wrote letters morning finished writing letters action completed writing letters morning describing longer time periods english needs context maintain distinction habitual called often past habit point completion perfective called action completed although construct used marks habitual aspect past tense used aspectual distinction otherwise clear
sometimes english lexical distinction languages distinction grammatical aspect example english verbs know state knowing find knowing viewed completed action correspond imperfect perfect forms equivalent verbs french spanish savoir saber also true sense verb know know somebody case opposed aspect verb meet even construction know correspond imperfect perfect forms conocer spanish german hand distinction also lexical english verbs lernen kennenlernen although semantic relation forms much straightforward since kennen means know lernen means learn
aspect tenseedit
germanic languages combine concept aspect concept tense although english largely separates tense aspect formally aspects neutral progressive perfect progressive perfect past tense habitual correspond closely distinction perfective imperfective found languages aspect furthermore separation tense aspect english maintained rigidly instance alternation forms english sentences eaten another pluperfect eaten sometimes represents combination past tense perfect full already eaten sometimes simply represents past action anterior another past action little eaten friend arrived latter situation often represented languages simple perfective tense formal spanish french past anterior tense cases
like tense aspect verbs represent time however rather locating event state time tense aspect describes internal temporal constituency situation words aspect conceiving flow process itself9 english aspectual distinctions past tense include went used going gone present tense lose losing lost losing going lose future modal seeing seen going distinguishes aspects within tense necessarily event occurs time occurs viewed complete ongoing consequential planned
dialects ancient greek aspect indicated uniquely verbal morphology example frequently used aorist though functional preterite indicative mood conveys historic immediate aspect subjunctive optative perfect moods used aspectual marker conveying sense resultant state ὁράω present εἶδον aorist οἶδα state seen know perfect
many sinotibetan languages like mandarin lack grammatical tense rich aspectcitation needed
lexical grammatical aspectedit
main article lexical aspect
distinction grammatical aspect described lexical aspect lexical aspect inherent property verb verbcomplement phrase marked formally distinctions made part lexical aspect different grammatical aspect typical distinctions states owned activities shopped accomplishments painted picture achievements bought punctual semelfactive events sneezed distinctions often relevant syntactically example states activities usually achievements used english prepositional forphrase describing time duration five hours shopped five hours bought five hours lexical aspect sometimes called aktionsart especially german slavic linguists lexical situation aspect marked athabaskan languages
factors situation aspect telicity telicity might considered kind lexical aspect except typically property verb isolation rather property entire verb phrase achievements accomplishments semelfactives telic situation aspect states activities atelic situation aspect
factor situation aspect duration also property verb phrase accomplishments states activities duration achievements semelfactives
indicating aspectedit
languages aspect time clearly separated making much distinct speakers number languages mark aspect much saliently time prominent category chinese american sign language differentiate many aspects rely exclusively optional timeindicating terms pinpoint action respect time language groups example modern indoeuropean languages except slavic languages aspect become almost entirely conflated verbal morphological system time
russian aspect salient tense narrative russian like slavic languages uses different lexical entries different aspects whereas languages mark morphologically still others auxiliaries english
literary arabic الفصحى alfuṣḥā verb aspecttenses perfective past imperfective nonpast disagreement among grammarians whether view distinction distinction aspect tense past verb الفعل الماضي alfiʿl almāḍī denotes event ḥadaṯ completed past says nothing relation past event present status example waṣala arrived indicates arrival occurred past without saying anything present status arriver maybe stuck around maybe turned around left aspect past event except insofar completeness considered aspectual past verb clearly similar identical greek aorist considered tense aspect marker arabic aorist aspect logical consequence past tense contrast verb similarity الفعل المضارع alfiʿl almuḍāriʿ called resemblance active participial noun considered denote event present future without committing specific aspectual sense beyond incompleteness implied tense يضرب yaḍribu strikesis strikingwill strikeetc tenses arabic counting command tradition counts denoting future events least thats tradition sees explicitly mark aspect arabic uses variety lexical syntactic devices
contemporary arabic dialects another matter major change alfuṣḥā prefix particle dialects explicitly mark progressive continuous habitual aspect بيكتب biyiktib writing writes time

important qualifications

although perfective often thought representing momentary action strictly correct equally well used action took time long conceived unit clearly defined start last summer visited france
grammatical aspect represents formal distinction encoded grammar language although languages described imperfective perfective aspects agree cases aspects agree every situation example

languages additional grammatical aspects spanish ancient greek example perfect perfective refers state resulting previous action also described previous action relevance particular time previous action viewed perspective later time corresponds roughly construction english recently eaten languages lack aspect portuguese closely related spanish often past perfective render present perfect compare roughly synonymous english sentences eaten
languages formal representation aspect optional omitted aspect clear context need emphasized case example mandarin chinese perfective suffix especially imperfective
verbs languages difference perfective imperfective conveys additional meaning difference cases aspects typically translated using separate verbs english greek example imperfective sometimes adds notion something socalled conative imperfect hence verb imperfective present imperfect aorist respectively used convey look search find listen hear example ηκουομεν ēkouomen listened ηκουσαμεν ēkousamen heard spanish similar pairs certain verbs imperfect preterite respectively sabía knew supe found podía able pude succeeded something quería wanted quise tried quería want quise refused something differences often highly languagespecific

english tense–aspect system morphologically distinct tenses present past marker future tense exists verb english futurity event expressed auxiliary verbs shall present form plus adverb tomorrow york city means past distinguished present–future contrast internal modifications verb tenses modified progressive aspect also called continuous aspect perfect aspectual forms also referred ing10 en11 respectively avoids unfamiliar terminology
aspects present tense

present simple progressive perfect
present progressive progressive perfect eating
present perfect progressive perfect eaten

note aspectual systems certain dialects english africanamerican vernacular english example habitual creoles based english vocabulary hawaiian creole english quite different standard english often distinguish aspect expense tense
german vernacular colloquialedit
although standard german aspects many upper german languages west central german languages vernacular german languages make aspectual distinction colloquial languages many regions socalled german regiolects officially discouraged schools seen language local english teachers like distinction corresponds well english continuous form formed conjugated auxiliary verb sein followed preposition infinitive nominalized verb latter phonetically indistinguishable writing capitalization differs essen essen eating compared standard german approximation beim essen forms standardized thus relatively infrequently written printed even quotations direct speech
tyrolean bavarian regiolect prefix found form perfective aspects gleant habe gelernt learnt daleant habe dalernt succeeded learning

dutch west germanic language types continuous form used types considered standard dutch
first type similar nonstandard german type formed conjugated auxiliary verb zijn followed gerund dutch matches infinitive example

present progressive werken working
past progressive werken working
future progressive werken zijn working

second type formed conjugated auxiliary verbs liggen zitten hangen hang staan stand lopen walk followed preposition infinitive conjugated verbs indicate stance subject performing undergoing action

present progressive eten eating sitting hangt drogen laundry drying hanging
past progressive lezen reading lying stond kijken watching standing
future progressive zitten werken working sitting

sometimes meaning auxiliary verb diminished engaged take instance examples

italian language example using verb mangiare
mood indicativo indicative

presente present mangio eating merges habitual continuous aspects among others
passato prossimo recent past mangiato eaten merges perfective perfect
imperfetto imperfect mangiavo eating usually merges habitual progressive aspects
trapassato prossimo recent pluperfect avevo mangiato eaten tense ordinarily marked aspect
passato remoto past mangiai perfective aspect
trapassato remoto pluperfect ebbi mangiato eaten tense
futuro semplice simple future mangerò shall tense
futuro anteriore future perfect avrò mangiato shall eaten future tense perfect tenseaspect

three types aspects must consider analyzing tokelauan language inherent aspect situation aspect viewpoint aspect13
inherent aspect describes purpose verb separates verbs another according vendler inherent aspect categorized four different types activities achievements accomplishments states simple activities include verbs pull jump punch achievements continue driveacar accomplishment hate example state another recognize state inherent aspect note whether changes example someone hate vegetables allergic state hate unchanging thus state inherent aspect hand achievement unlike state lasts short amount time achievement highpoint action13
another type aspect situation aspect situation aspect described experiencing life circumstance therefore understanding situation situation aspect abstract terms physically tangible also used based upon ones point view example professor student comes minute class starts punctual student based upon professors judgment punctuality make assumption situation student situation aspect firstly divided states occurrences later subdivided occurrences processes events lastly events accomplishments achievements13
third type aspect viewpoint aspect viewpoint aspect likened situation aspect take consideration ones inferences however viewpoint aspect diverges situation aspect decides view event perfect example glass metaphor glass half full half empty choice half full represents optimistic viewpoint choice half empty represents pessimistic viewpoint viewpoint aspect separate negative positive rather different point views people describe painting bring different viewpoints describe situation aspect perfect imperfect perfect situation aspect entails event reference time imperfect situation aspect makes reference time observation13
