brick making beginning 20th century


three basic types brick unfired fired chemically bricks type manufactured differently
mudbrick

unfired bricks also known mudbricks made claycontaining soil mixed straw similar binders airdried ready
fired brick




bricks sundrying fired


fired bricks burned kiln makes durable modern fired clay bricks formed three processes soft press extruded depending country either extruded soft method common since economical
normally bricks contain following ingredients15

silica sand weight
alumina clay weight
lime weight
iron oxide weight
magnesia less weight

shaping methods
three main methods used shaping materials bricks fired

molded bricks bricks start clay preferably 25–30 sand reduce shrinkage clay first ground mixed water desired consistency clay pressed steel moulds hydraulic press shaped clay fired burned 900–1000 achieve strength
drypressed bricks drypress method similar softmud moulded method starts much thicker clay forms accurate sharperedged bricks greater force pressing longer burn make method expensive
extruded bricks extruded bricks clay mixed 10–15 water stiff extrusion 20–25 water soft extrusion pugmill mixture forced create long cable material desired width depth mass bricks desired length wall wires structural bricks made method produces hard dense bricks suitable dies produce perforations well introduction holes reduces volume clay needed hence cost hollow bricks lighter easier handle different thermal properties solid bricks bricks hardened drying hours fired heat drying often waste heat kiln
