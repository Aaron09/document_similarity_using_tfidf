business world 808xbased machines msdos tied faced competition unix operating system many different hardware architectures microsoft sold version unix called xenix
emerging world home users variety computers based various processors serious competition apple early apple macintosh commodore others 808x processor many 808x machines different architectures used custom versions msdos first machines competition time hardware configuration became dominant 808x market software written communicate directly hardware without using standard operating system calls much faster true pccompatibles nonpccompatible 808x machines small market fast software written alone market remained open machines closely imitated architecture running either single version msdos compatible equivalent clones cost much less ibmbranded machines similar performance became widely used home users large share business computer market
microsoft together began intended followon msdospc called released 1987 microsoft began advertising campaign announcing dead stating version last full release designed efficient multitasking standard operating systems since 1963 offered number advanced features designed together similar look feel seen legitimate heir kludgy platform
msdos grown spurts many significant features taken duplicated microsofts products operating systems msdos also grew incorporating direct licensing feature duplicating functionality tools utilities developed independent companies norton utilities tools microsoft antivirus qemm expanded memory manager stacker disk compression others
period digital research competing operating system market computers like amstrad pc1512 sold floppy disks operating systems could used time msdos cpm86 derivative digital research produced plus compatible msdos supported cpm86 programs additional features including multitasking could read write disks msdos format
protracted development digital research released msdos compatible included features available thirdparty addons msdos unwilling lose portion market microsoft responded announcing pending release msdos 1990 effectively killed sales actual release msdos june 1991 digital research brought sold well preannouncement msdos stifled sales
microsoft accused carefully orchestrating leaks future versions msdos attempt create industry called fear uncertainty doubt regarding example october 1990 shortly release long eventual june 1991 release msdos stories feature enhancements msdos started appear infoworld week brad silverberg vice president systems software microsoft general manager windows msdos business unit wrote forceful letter week november 1990 denying microsoft engaged tactics serve customers better decided forthcoming version denying microsoft copied features

undocumented apisedit
microsoft also used variety tactics msdos several applications development tools operating perfectly running genuine msdos would break another vendors implementation notable examples practice included

microsofts quickpascal released early 1989 first product checked msdos modifying programs program segment prefix using undocumented functions checked whether associated value changed fixed position within data segment also undocumented check also made later products including microsoft quickc programmers workbench microsoft v6032
aard code block code windows launcher wincom system files windows encrypted selfmodifying deliberately obfuscated using various undocumented structures functions determine whether windows really running msdos32 beta versions displayed error message test genuine msdos failed prompting user abort continue abort default final release version code still message prompt disabled added flag byte rendering probably ineffectual

note windows beta code gave warning windows would operate properly foreign fact fine
