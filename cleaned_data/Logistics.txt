fundamentally different forms logistics optimizes steady flow material network transport links storage nodes coordinates sequence resources carry project restructuring warehouse
nodes distribution networkedit
nodes distribution network include

factories products manufactured assembled
depot deposit standard type warehouse thought storing merchandise high level inventory
distribution centers order processing order fulfillment lower level inventory also receiving returning items clients
transit points built cross docking activities consist reassembling cargo units based deliveries scheduled moving merchandise
traditional retail stores variety modern supermarkets hypermarkets discount stores also voluntary chains consumers cooperative groups consumer collective buying power note subsidiaries mostly owned another company franchisers although using company brands actually point sale

intermediaries operating representative matters nodes sales agents brokers
logistic families metricsedit
logistic family products share common characteristic weight volumetric characteristics physical storing needs temperature radiation handling needs order frequency package size following metrics used company organize products different families17

physical metrics used evaluate inventory systems include stocking capacity selectivity superficial utilization volumetric utilization transport capacity transport capacity utilization
monetary metrics used include space holding costs building shelving services handling costs people handling machinery energy maintenance

metrics present physical monetary form standard inventory turnover

similarly production systems logistic systems need properly configured managed actually number methodologies directly borrowed operations management using economic order quantity models managing inventory nodes network21 distribution resource planning similar except doesnt concern activities inside nodes network planning distribution moving goods links network
traditionally logistics configuration level warehouse node level distribution system network
regarding single warehouse besides issue designing building warehouse configuration means solving number interrelated technicaleconomic problems dimensioning rack cells choosing palletizing method manual robots rack dimensioning design number racks number typology retrieval systems stacker cranes important constraints satisfied fork load beams resistance bending proper placement sprinklers although picking tactical planning decision configuration problem important take account deciding racks layout inside warehouse buying tools handlers motorized carts since decisions taken work constraints managing warehouse reasoning sorting designing conveyor system installing automatic dispensers
configuration level distribution system concerns primarily problem location nodes geographic space distribution capacity among nodes first referred facility location special case site selection latter capacity allocation problem outsourcing typically arises level nodes supply chain rarely owned single enterprise distribution networks characterized numbers levels namely number intermediary nodes supplier consumer

direct store delivery zero levels
level network central warehouse
