user interface interaction designedit




graphical user interface presented displayed computer screen result processed user input usually main interface humanmachine interaction touch user interfaces popular small mobile devices overlay visual output visual input


designing visual composition temporal behavior important part software application programming area human–computer interaction goal enhance efficiency ease underlying logical design stored program design discipline named usability methods usercentered design used ensure visual language introduced design welltailored tasks
visible graphical interface features application sometimes referred chrome pronounced gooey78 typically users interact information manipulating visual widgets allow interactions appropriate kind data hold widgets welldesigned interface selected support actions necessary achieve goals users model–view–controller allows flexible structure interface independent indirectly linked application functions customized easily allows users select design different skin eases designers work change interface user needs evolve good user interface design relates users system architecture less
large widgets windows usually provide frame container main presentation content page email message drawing smaller ones usually userinput tool

xerox parc user interface consisted graphical elements windows menus radio buttons check boxes concept icons later introduced david canfield smith written thesis subject guidance kay121314 parc user interface employs pointing device along keyboard aspects emphasized using alternative term acronym windows icons menus pointing device wimp effort culminated 1973 xerox alto first computer though system never reached commercial production

commandline interfacesedit




modern


since commands available command line interfaces many complex operations performed using short sequence words symbols allows greater efficiency productivity many commands learned123 reaching level takes time command words easily discoverable mnemonic also using command line become slow errorprone users must enter long commands comprising many parameters several different filenames however windows icons menus pointer wimp interfaces present users many widgets represent trigger systems available commands
guis made quite hard dialogs buried deep system moved different places redesigns also icons dialog boxes usually harder users script
wimps extensively modes meaning keys clicks specific positions screen redefined time command line interfaces modes limited forms current directory environment variables
modern operating systems provide level although guis usually receive attention usually wimpbased although occasionally metaphors surface used microsoft 3dwm file system visualizer
wrappersedit
graphical user interface wrappers circumvent commandline interface versions typically linux unixlike software applications textbased user interfaces typed command labels commandline textbased application allow users program noninteractively wrappers atop avoid steep learning curve commandline requires commands typed keyboard starting wrapper users intuitively interact start stop change working parameters graphical icons visual indicators desktop environment example applications also provide interfaces usually wimp wrapper around commandline version especially common applications designed unixlike operating systems latter used implemented first allowed developers focus exclusively products functionality without bothering interface details designing icons placing buttons designing programs also allows users program shell script
threedimensional user interfacesedit
section user interfaces software physical inputoutput devices interaction user interfaces
typical computer displays threedimensional misnomer—their displays twodimensional semantically however graphical user interfaces three dimensions height width offer third dimension layering stacking screen elements another represented visually screen illusionary transparent effect offers advantage information background windows still read interacted environment simply hide background information possibly making distinction apparent drawing drop shadow effect
environments methods graphics project virtual three dimensional user interface objects onto screen often shown science fiction films examples processing power computer graphics hardware increases becomes less obstacle smooth user experience
threedimensional graphics currently mostly used computer games computeraided design threedimensional computing environment also useful uses like molecular graphics aircraft design
several attempts made create multiuser threedimensional environment including croquet project suns project looking glass

threedimensional graphics become increasingly common mainstream operating systems creating attractive interfaces termed candy functional purposes possible using three dimensions example user switching represented rotating cube faces users workspace window management represented rolodexstyle flipping mechanism windows vista windows flip cases operating system transforms windows onthefly continuing update content windows
interfaces window system also implemented advanced threedimensional user interfaces compositing window managers beryl compiz kwin using aiglx architectures allowing opengl animate user interactions desktop
another branch threedimensional desktop environment threedimensional guis take desktop metaphor step like bumptop users manipulate documents windows physical documents realistic movement physics
zooming user interface related technology promises deliver representation benefits environments without usability drawbacks orientation problems hidden objects logical advance blending threedimensional movement twodimensional vector objects 2006 hillcrest labs introduced first zooming user interface television31
science fictionedit
threedimensional guis appeared science fiction literature films technically feasible common example 1993 american film jurassic park features silicon graphics threedimensional file manager file system navigator reallife file manager unix operating systems film minority report scenes police officers using specialized data systems prose fiction threedimensional user interfaces portrayed immersible environments like william gibsons cyberspace neal stephensons metaverse many futuristic imaginings user interfaces rely heavily objectoriented user interface ooui style especially objectoriented graphical user interface oogui style32
