support deregulationedit
supporters taxicab deregulation argue deregulation causes following benefits56

lower prices taxis competing market56
lower operating costs incentivized competition56
competition adds quality pressure enhance ones reputation56
innovations sharedride markets special services disabled market niches56
demand taxi services increases prices fall quality improves56

however appears consensus taxi deregulation less impressive advocates hoped56 possible reasons include overestimation deregulation could deliver insufficiently thorough deregulation56
deregulation advocates claim taxi service level increases poorest sections city effect highest peak hours weather demand highest56
deregulation advocates also claim deregulated environment57

black market taxis become legal possibly eliminating problems57
cities save money plan enforce regulation57

nearly deregulating cities number taxis increased people employed drivers deregulation advocates claim needs better satisfied58
existing taxi companies limit competition potential entrants example york city monopoly advantage taxi license holders million early 1980s city 1400 fewer licenses 1937 proponents deregulation argue main losers carless poor disabled59 taxi owners form strong lobby network marginalizes drivers taxi users also pays local government officials uphold taxi regulation60 regulators usually wish rise taxiowner lobby61 politicians want taxi drivers negative opinion them62
taxi deregulation proponents claims immigrants poor minorities suffer taxi regulation work requires relatively little education regulation makes entrance taxi business particularly difficult them63 elderly disabled housewives poor taxis often others56
according moore rose better address potential problems deregulation directly instead regulating number taxi licences example regulators want increase safety make safety statutes publish public list safe taxi operators64
also proponents deregulation claim officials want regulate prices standardize measures rather command prices example require distance tariffs first miles every subsequent miles make easier compare prices different taxis prohibit pricing distance pricing65 deregulation advocates claim regulators limited information market
airport taxis special caseedit
deregulation proponents less opposed airport taxi regulation regulation taxi services argue airport regulates prices taxis taxi queues regulation fewer disadvantages citywide regulation airport determine prices organize different queues taxi services different qualities prices argued whether rules owner airport regulation business model65
partial deregulation failureedit
proponents deregulation argue partial deregulation cause many cases deregulation failing achieve desirable results united states cities many cities retained regulations prices services allowing free entrance taxi business deregulation advocates argue prevented market mechanisms solving information problems entrants found difficult customers using services cheap prices also ridesharing often prohibited65
often officials also prohibited pricing would made short rides sparsely populated areas profitable thus drivers refused take customers therefore partial deregulation always enough enhance situation65 study claims deregulation applied small area58
taxi regulation report concluded grounds limiting number taxi companies cars limitations cause disproportionate burden income people better increase unprofitable areas force taxis serve areas67
according report experience free entry price competition mainly positive prices fallen waiting times shortened market shares biggest companies fallen city councils saved time licensing fare setting however airports either price ceilings allow price competition altering queue system67
opposition deregulationedit
opponents taxi deregulation argue deregulation result high taxi driver turnover rates cause number lessqualified taxi drivers increase dishonest business practices price gouging especially airport routes circuitous routing poor customer service68
connecticut general assembly report argues deregulation fails cause price decreases taxi passengers typically price comparison shop searching taxicabs fares usually increased deregulation higher supply taxis caused drivers’ earning potential decrease69 report claims deregulation resulted dramatically increased taxi supply especially already overserved airport locations fare increases every city increase shorttrip refusals taxicab drivers69
report argues deregulation undesirable results several american cities seattle deregulated taxis 1980 resulting high supply taxicabs variable rates price gouging shorthaul refusals poor treatment passengers69 result seattle reregulated 1984 reinstating restriction taxicab licenses fare controls69 louis deregulation produced rise taxi fares taxicab drivers complained waiting hours airports customers taxicab stands69 taxicab companies claimed increased fares order make lost competition resulting increased supply taxis result louis city council froze taxicab licenses 200269
study deregulation taxis sweden 1991 showed taxicab supply increased average fares also increased almost cases70 specifically average fares hour increased trips average fares also increased fares calculated distance kilometer almost every category studied customerpaid trips municipalities sizes small medium large increased municipalitypaid trips small large municipalities fares decreased municipalitypaid trips mediumsized municipalities calculated kilometer70 deregulation also resulted decreased taxicab productivity decreased taxicompany revenues70 study concluded deregulation resulted increased fares especially rural areas authors argued increased fares taxi company revenues deregulation70
black market taxis often problems safety poor customer service fares situation made worse customer patronize taxis cannot complain police media however proponent taxi deregulation argue illegal taxis become legalized behavior improve complaints officials formerly illegal taxis would allowed57
taxi companies claim deregulation lead unstable taxi market however proderegulation study kitch isaacson kasper claims previous argument myth ignores free taxi competition 192966
taxi companies claim deregulation would cause problems raise prices lower service level certain hours certain places
medallion systemwhen defined as71 defended experts argue medallion system similar brandname capital asset enforces quality service quality service results higher ridership thus increasing value owning medallion72 argue issuing medallions would decrease medallion value thus incentive medallion owner provide quality service comply city regulations72 also argue medallion preferable alternate systems regulation fines required bonds seizures interest payments bonds violations licensing wouldbe taxis revocation license violations fines difficult collect license revocation sufficient deterrent profitable violations price cheating using penalties bond interest payments give regulators incentive impose penalties collect revenue rather legitimate violations73 medallions earn interest thus inappropriate seizures interest regulators possible74
