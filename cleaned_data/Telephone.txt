early commercial instruments
early telephones technically diverse used water microphone metal diaphragm induced current electromagnet wound around permanent magnet dynamic diaphragm vibrated coil wire field permanent magnet coil vibrated diaphragm soundpowered dynamic variants survived small numbers 20th century military maritime applications ability create electrical power crucial however used edisonberliner carbon transmitter much louder kinds even though required induction coil impedance matching transformer make compatible impedance line edison patents kept bell monopoly viable 20th century time network important instrument
early telephones locally powered using either dynamic transmitter powering transmitter local battery jobs outside plant personnel visit telephone periodically inspect battery 20th century telephones powered telephone exchange wires carried voice signals became common
early telephones used single wire subscribers line ground return used complete circuit used telegraphs earliest dynamic telephones also port opening sound user alternately listening speaking rather shouting hole sometimes instruments operated pairs making conversation convenient also expensive
first benefits telephone exchange exploited instead telephones leased pairs subscriber arrange telegraph contractor construct line example home shop users wanted ability speak several different locations would need obtain three four pairs telephones western union already using telegraph exchanges quickly extended principle telephones york city francisco bell slow appreciating potential
signalling began appropriately primitive manner user alerted exchange operator whistling transmitter exchange operation soon resulted telephones equipped bell ringer first operated second wire later wire condenser capacitor series bell coil allow ringer signal still blocking keeping phone hook telephones connected earliest strowger switch automatic exchanges seven wires knife switch telegraph bell pushbutton speaking large wall telephones early 20th century usually incorporated bell separate bell boxes desk phones dwindled away middle century
rural telephones common battery exchange magneto handcranked generator produce high voltage alternating signal ring bells telephones line alert operator local farming communities connected main networks barbed wire telephone lines exploited existing system field fences transmit signal
1890s smaller style telephone introduced packaged three parts transmitter stood stand known candlestick shape receiver hung hook switch known switchhook previous telephones required user operate separate switch connect either voice bell kind user less likely leave phone hook phones connected magneto exchanges bell induction coil battery magneto separate bell ringer box7 phones connected common battery exchanges ringer installed desk place since need battery magneto
cradle designs also used time handle receiver transmitter attached called handset separate cradle base housed magneto crank parts larger candlestick popular
disadvantages single wire operation crosstalk nearby power wires already twisted pairs long distance telephones fourwire circuits users beginning 20th century place long distance calls telephones made appointment special soundproofed long distance telephone booth furnished latest technology
turned popular longest lasting physical style telephone introduced early 20th century including bells 202type desk carbon granule transmitter electromagnetic receiver united single molded plastic handle cradle base unit circuit diagram model shows direct connection transmitter line receiver induction coupled local battery configurations local loop long provide sufficient current exchange transmitter powered local battery inductively coupled receiver included local loop8 coupling transformer ringer mounted separate enclosure called subscriber dial switch base interrupted line current repeatedly briefly disconnecting line times digit hook switch center circuit diagram disconnected line transmitter battery handset cradle
1930s telephone sets developed combined bell induction coil desk obviating separate ringer rotary dial becoming commonplace 1930s many areas enabled customerdialed service magneto systems remained even 1960s worldwar telephone networks rapid expansion efficient telephone sets model telephone united states developed permitted larger local networks centered around central offices breakthrough technology introduction touchtone signaling using pushbutton telephones american telephone telegraph company 1963

development digital data communications method protocols used internet became possible digitize voice transmit realtime data across computer networks giving rise field internet protocol telephony also known voice internet protocol voip term reflects methodology memorably voip proven disruptive technology rapidly replacing traditional telephone network infrastructure
january 2005 telephone subscribers japan south korea switched digital telephone service january 2005 newsweek article suggested internet telephony next thing9 2006 many voip companies offer service consumers businesses
customer perspective telephony uses highbandwidth internet connection specialized customer premises equipment transmit telephone calls internet modern private data network customer equipment analog telephone adapter interfaces conventional analog telephone networking equipment phone networking interface technology built desktop provides traditional familiar parts telephone handset dial keypad ringer package usually resembles standard telephone
addition many computer software vendors telephony operators provide softphone application software emulates telephone attached microphone audio headset loud speaker
despite features conveniences telephones notable disadvantages compared traditional telephones unless telephones components backed uninterruptible power supply emergency power source phone ceases function power outage occur emergency disaster phone needed traditional phones connected older pstn network experience problem since powered telephone companys battery supply continue function even prolonged power outage another problem internetbased services lack fixed physical location impacting provisioning emergency services police fire ambulance someone call unless registered user updates phones physical address location moving residence emergency services dispatched wrong location
