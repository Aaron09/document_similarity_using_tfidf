palms monophyletic group plants meaning group consists common ancestor descendants13 extensive taxonomic research palms began botanist moore organized palms major groups based mostly general morphological characteristics following classification proposed dransfield 1987 revision moores classification organizes palms subfamilies14

coryphoideae
calamoideae
nypoideae
ceroxyloideae
arecoideae
phytelephantoideae

general traits subfamily listed
coryphoideae diverse subfamily paraphyletic group meaning members group share common ancestor group include ancestors descendants palms subfamily palmately lobed leaves solitary flowers three sometimes four carpels fruit normally develops carpel
subfamily calamoideae includes climbing palms rattans leaves usually pinnate derived characters synapomorphies include spines various organs organs specialized climbing extension main stem leafbearing reflexed spines overlapping scales covering fruit ovary
subfamily nypoideae contains species nypa fruticans15 large pinnate leaves fruit unusual floats stem dichotomously branched also unusual palms
subfamily ceroxyloideae small mediumsized flowers spirally arranged gynoecium three joined carpels
arecoideae largest subfamily diverse tribes areceae caryoteae cocoeae geonomeae iriarteeae podococceae containing genera tribes pinnate bipinnate leaves flowers arranged groups three central pistillate staminate flowers
phytelephantoideae monoecious subfamily members group distinct monopodial flower clusters distinct features include gynoecium five joined carpels flowers three parts whorl fruits multipleseeded multiple parts16
currently extensive phylogenetic studies arecaceae exist 1997 baker explored subfamily tribe relationships using chloroplast genera subfamilies tribes results strongly showed calamoideae monophyletic ceroxyloideae coryphoideae paraphyletic relationships arecoideae uncertain possibly related ceroxyloideae phytelephantoideae studies suggested lack fully resolved hypothesis relationships within family variety factors including difficulties selecting appropriate outgroups homoplasy morphological character states slow rates molecular evolution important standard markers character polarization17 however hybridization observed among orbignya phoenix species using chloroplast cladistic studies produce inaccurate results maternal inheritance chloroplast chemical molecular data nonorganelle example could effective studying palm phylogeny16
