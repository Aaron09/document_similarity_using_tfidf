asexual
main article asexual reproduction
asexual reproduction process organisms create genetically similar identical copies without contribution genetic material another organism bacteria divide asexually binary fission viruses take control host cells produce viruses hydras invertebrates order hydroidea yeasts able reproduce budding organisms often possess different sexes capable splitting copies plants ability reproduce asexually species mycocepurus smithii thought reproduce entirely asexual means
species capable reproducing asexually like hydra yeast mating yeasts jellyfish also reproduce sexually instance plants capable vegetative reproduction—reproduction without seeds spores—but also reproduce sexually likewise bacteria exchange genetic information conjugation
ways asexual reproduction include parthenogenesis fragmentation spore formation involves mitosis parthenogenesis growth development embryo seed without fertilization male parthenogenesis occurs naturally species including lower plants called apomixis invertebrates water fleas aphids bees parasitic wasps vertebrates reptiles3 fish rarely birds4 sharks5 sometimes also used describe reproduction modes hermaphroditic species selffertilize
sexual

sexual reproduction biological process creates organism combining genetic material organisms process starts meiosis specialized type cell division parent organisms contributes half offsprings genetic makeup creating haploid gametes organisms form different types gametes anisogamous species sexes referred male producing sperm microspores female producing megaspores isogamous species gametes similar identical form isogametes separable properties given different names isogamy example green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii socalled plus minus gametes types organisms many fungi ciliate paramecium aurelia6 sexes called syngens animals including humans plants reproduce sexually sexually reproducing organisms different sets genes every trait called alleles offspring inherit allele trait parent thus offspring combination parents genes believed masking deleterious alleles favors evolution dominant diploid phase organisms alternate haploid diploid phases recombination occurs freely78
bryophytes reproduce sexually larger commonlyseen organisms haploid produce gametes gametes fuse form zygote develops sporangium turn produces haploid spores diploid stage relatively small shortlived compared haploid stage haploid dominance advantage diploidy heterosis exists diploid life generation bryophytes retain sexual reproduction despite fact haploid stage benefit heterosis indication sexual reproduction advantages heterosis genetic recombination members species allowing expression wider range traits thus making population able survive environmental variation
allogamy
main article allogamy
allogamy fertilization combination gametes parents generally ovum individual spermatozoa another isogamous species gametes defined either sperm ovum
autogamy
main article autogamy
selffertilization also known autogamy occurs hermaphroditic organisms gametes fused fertilization come individual many vascular plants foraminiferans ciliates term autogamy sometimes substituted autogamous pollination necessarily leading successful fertilization describes selfpollination within flower distinguished geitonogamous pollination transfer pollen different flower flowering plant9 within single monoecious gymnosperm plant
mitosis meiosis
mitosis meiosis types cell division mitosis occurs somatic cells meiosis occurs gametes
mitosis resultant number cells mitosis twice number original cells number chromosomes offspring cells parent cell

meiosis resultant number cells four times number original cells results cells half number chromosomes present parent cell diploid cell duplicates undergoes divisions tetraploid diploid haploid process forming four haploid cells process occurs phases meiosis meiosis

samesex
recent decades developmental biologists researching developing techniques facilitate samesex reproduction10 obvious approaches subject growing amount activity female sperm male eggs female sperm closer reality humans given japanese scientists already created female sperm chickens however ratio produced chromosomebearing wbearing spermatozoa fell substantially expectations therefore concluded wbearing could differentiate spermatozoa restricted spermatogenesis11 2004 altering function genes involved imprinting japanese scientists combined mouse eggs produce daughter mice12
strategies
information modes reproduction
wide range reproductive strategies employed different species animals human northern gannet reach sexual maturity many years birth even produce offspring others reproduce quickly normal circumstances offspring survive adulthood example rabbit mature months produce 10–30 offspring year fruit mature 10–14 days produce offspring year main strategies known kselection offspring rselection many offspring strategy favoured evolution depends variety circumstances animals offspring devote resources nurturing protection individual offspring thus reducing need many offspring hand animals many offspring devote fewer resources individual offspring types animals common many offspring soon birth enough individuals typically survive maintain population organisms honey bees fruit flies retain sperm process called sperm storage thereby increasing duration fertility
types
main article semelparity iteroparity

polycyclic animals reproduce intermittently throughout lives
semelparous organisms reproduce lifetime annual plants including grain crops certain species salmon spider bamboo century plant often shortly reproduction often associated rstrategists
iteroparous organisms produce offspring successive annual seasonal cycles perennial plants iteroparous animals survive multiple seasons periodic condition changes associated kstrategists

asexual sexual reproduction




illustration twofold cost sexual reproduction organism contribute number offspring population remains size generation asexual population doubles size generation


organisms reproduce asexual reproduction tend grow number exponentially however rely mutation variations members species similar vulnerabilities organisms reproduce sexually yield smaller number offspring large amount variation genes makes less susceptible disease
many organisms reproduce sexually well asexually aphids slime molds anemones species starfish fragmentation many plants examples environmental factors favorable asexual reproduction employed exploit suitable conditions survival abundant food supply adequate shelter favorable climate disease optimum proper lifestyle requirements populations organisms increase exponentially asexual reproductive strategies take full advantage rich supply resources
food sources depleted climate becomes hostile individual survival jeopardized adverse change living conditions organisms switch sexual forms reproduction sexual reproduction ensures mixing gene pool species variations found offspring sexual reproduction allow individuals better suited survival provide mechanism selective adaptation occur meiosis stage sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair damages meiosis bernstein al13 addition sexual reproduction usually results formation life stage able endure conditions threaten offspring asexual parent thus seeds spores eggs pupae cysts overwintering stages sexual reproduction ensure survival unfavorable times organism wait adverse situations swing back suitability occurs
life without
existence life without reproduction subject speculation biological study origin life produced reproducing organisms nonreproducing elements called abiogenesis whether several independent abiogenetic events biologists believe last universal ancestor present life earth lived billion years
scientists speculated possibility creating life nonreproductively laboratory several scientists succeeded producing simple viruses entirely nonliving materials14 however viruses often regarded alive nothing protein capsule metabolism replicate assistance hijacked cells metabolic machinery
production truly living organism simple bacterium ancestors would much complex task well possible degree according current biological knowledge synthetic genome transferred existing bacterium replaced native resulting artificial production mycoides organism15
debate within scientific community whether cell considered completely synthetic16 grounds chemically synthesized genome almost copy naturally occurring genome recipient cell naturally occurring bacterium craig venter institute maintains term synthetic bacterial cell also clarify consider creating life scratch rather creating life already existing life using synthetic dna17 venter plans patent experimental cells stating pretty clearly human inventions16 creators suggests building synthetic life would allow researchers learn life building rather tearing apart also propose stretch boundaries life machines overlap yield truly programmable organisms18 researchers involved stated creation true synthetic biochemical life relatively close reach current technology cheap compared effort needed place moon19
lottery principle
sexual reproduction many drawbacks since requires energy asexual reproduction diverts organisms pursuits argument many species george williams used lottery tickets analogy explanation widespread sexual reproduction20 argued asexual reproduction produces little genetic variety offspring like buying many tickets number limiting chance winning producing surviving offspring sexual reproduction argued like purchasing fewer tickets greater variety numbers therefore greater chance success point analogy since asexual reproduction produce genetic variations little ability quickly adapt changing environment lottery principle less accepted days evidence asexual reproduction prevalent unstable environments opposite predicts
