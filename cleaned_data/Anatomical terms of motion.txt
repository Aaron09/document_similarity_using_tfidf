classificationedit
motions classified anatomical planes occur although movement often combination different motions occurring simultaneously several planes2 motions split categories relating nature joints involved

gliding motions occur flat surfaces intervertebral discs carpal metacarpal bones hand1
angular motions occur synovial joints causes either increase decrease angles bones1
rotational motions move structure rotational motion along longitudinal axis turning head look either side3

apart motions also divided

linear motions translatory motions move line points rectilinear motion motion straight line points whereas curvilinear motion motion following curved path2
angular motions rotary motions occur object around another object increasing decreasing angle different parts object move distance examples include movement knee lower changes angle compared femur movements ankle2

study movement known kinesiology4 categoric list movements human body muscles involved found list movements human body
abnormal motionedit
prefix hyper sometimes added describe movement beyond normal limits hypermobility hyperflexion hyperextension range motion describes total range motion joint able example part body joint overstretched bent backwards exaggerated extension motion described hyperextended hyperextension increases stress ligaments joint always voluntary movement result accidents falls causes trauma also used surgery temporarily dislocating joints surgical procedures
general motionedit
general terms used describe movements body makes terms clear opposite treated pairs7
flexion extensionedit




flexion extension


also list flexors human body list extensors human body
flexion extension describe movements affect angle parts body terms come latin words meaninga
flexion describes bending movement decreases angle segment proximal segment9 example bending elbow clenching hand fist examples flexion sitting knees flexed joint move forward backward neck trunk flexion refers movement anterior direction10 flexion shoulder refers movement forward11
extension opposite flexion describing straightening movement increases angle body parts12 joint move forward backward neck trunk extension refers movement posterior direction10 example standing knees extended extension shoulder moves backward11 chin chest head flexed trunk flexed person leans forward

abduction adductionedit




abduction adduction


also list abductors human body list adductors human body
abduction motion structure away midline adduction refer motion towards centre body13 centre body defined midsagittal plane3 terms come latin words similar meanings latin prefix indicating away indicating toward ducere meaning draw pull english words duct conduct inductionb
abduction refers motion pulls structure part away midline body case fingers toes refers spreading digits apart away centerline hand foot abduction wrist also called radial deviation13 example raising arms tightropewalking example abduction shoulder11 legs splayed star jump split legs abducted hip3
adduction refers motion pulls structure part toward midline body towards midline limb case fingers toes refers bringing digits together towards centerline hand foot adduction wrist also called ulnar deviation dropping arms sides bringing knees together examples adduction13
ulnar deviation hand moving towards ulnar styloid towards pinkyfifth digit radial deviation hand moving towards radial styloid towards thumbfirst digit15
elevation depressionedit
also list elevators human body list depressors human body
terms elevation depression refer movement horizontal derive latin terms similar meaningsc
elevation refers movement superior direction17 example shrugging example elevation scapula
depression refers movement inferior direction opposite elevation19
rotationedit




rotation


also list internal rotators human body list external rotators human body
rotation body parts referred internal external referring rotation towards away center body20
internal rotation medial rotation refers rotation towards axis body20
external rotation lateral rotation refers rotation away center body20







lotus position yoga demonstrating external rotation









rotating away body external rotation









rotating closer body internal rotation




otheredit

anterograde retrograde flow refers movement blood fluids normal anterograde abnormal retrograde direction21
circumduction refers conical movement body part ball socket joint circumduction combination flexion extension adduction abduction circumduction best performed ball socket joints shoulder also performed parts body fingers hands feet head22 example circumduction occurs spinning performing serve tennis bowling cricket ball
reduction refers motion returning bone original state24 shoulder reduction following shoulder dislocation reduction hernia








swinging action made tennis serve example circumduction




special motionedit
hands feetedit
flexion extension footedit
dorsiflexion plantar flexion refer extension flexion foot ankle terms refer flexion foot bodys dorsal surface considered front flexion foot bodys plantar surface considered back leg25 terms used resolve confusion technically extension joint refers dorsiflexion could considered counterintuitive motion reduces angle foot
dorsiflexion toes brought closer shin decreases angle dorsum foot leg27 example walking heels ankle described dorsiflexion26
plantar flexion movement decreases angle sole foot back example movement depressing pedal standing tiptoes described plantar flexion26







ballerina demonstrating plantar flexion feet









dorsi plantar flexion foot




flexion extension handedit
palmarflexion dorsiflexion refer movement flexion palmarflexion extension dorsiflexion hand wrist28 terms refer flexion hand bodys dorsal surface anatomical position considered back flexion hand bodys palmar surface anatomical position considered anterior side arm29 direction terms opposite foot embryological rotation limbs opposite directions10
palmarflexion refers decreasing angle palm anterior forearm28
dorsiflexion refers extension ankle wrist joint brings hand closer dorsum body28







praying hands albrecht dürer demonstrating dorsiflexion hands




pronation supinationedit
also pronation foot
pronation proʊˈneɪʃən supination suːpɪˈneɪʃən refer generally assuming prone supine positions often used specific sense referring rotation forearm foot standard anatomical position palm sole facing anteriorly supination posteriorly pronation30
pronation forearm rotational movement hand upper turned inwards pronation foot refers turning sole outwards weight borne medial part foot31
supination forearm occurs forearm palm rotated outwards supination foot refers turning sole foot inwards shifting weight lateral edge32







supination pronation foot









supination pronation




inversion eversionedit
inversion eversion refer movements tilt sole foot away eversion towards inversion midline body33
eversion movement sole foot away median plane34 inversion movement sole towards median plane example inversion describes motion ankle twisted27







example showing inversion eversion foot









eversion right foot









inversion right foot




eyesedit
main article movement terminology
unique terminology also used describe example

version movement involving eyes moving synchronously symmetrically direction35
torsion refers movement affects vertical axis eye36 movement made looking nose

teethedit

occlusion refers motion mandibula towards maxilla making contact teeth37
protrusion retrusion sometimes used describe anterior protrusion posterior retrusion movement jaw38








examples showing protrusion retrusion









elevation depression




otheredit
terms include

nutation counternutationd refer movement sacrum defined rotation promontory downwards anteriorly lumbar extension nutation upwards posteriorly lumbar flexion counternutation40
opposition refers movement involves grasping thumb fingers41
protraction retraction refer anterior protraction posterior retraction movement42 shoulders although terms criticised nonspecific43
reciprocal motion refers alternating motions opposing directions44
reposition refers restoring object natural condition45








nutation left counternutation right









example opposition
