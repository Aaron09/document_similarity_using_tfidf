oceanic highland climate also known marine maritime climate köppen classification climate typical west coasts higher middle latitudes continents generally features cool summers relative latitude cool winters relatively narrow annual temperature range extremes temperature exception transitional areas continental subarctic highland climates oceanic climates defined monthly mean temperature warmest month coldest month
typically lacks season precipitation evenly dispersed throughout year predominant climate type across much western europe pacific northwest region united states canada portions central mexico southwestern south america southeastern australia including tasmania zealand well isolated locations elsewhere oceanic climates generally warm summers cool cold winters characterised narrower annual range temperatures encountered places comparable latitude generally extremely summers mediterranean climates summers humid subtropical1 oceanic climates dominant europe spread much farther inland continents2
oceanic climates much storm activity located belt stormy westerlies many oceanic climates frequent cloudy overcast conditions near constant storms lows tracking near annual range temperatures smaller typical climates latitudes constant stable marine masses pass oceanic climates lack warm cool fronts

precipitation adequate reliable throughout year oceanic climates extended months rain cloudy conditions common oceanic climates seattle example october seattle experiences high rainfall mostly partly cloudy every seven days3
areas oceanic climate precipitation comes form rain majority year however areas climate snowfall annually winter oceanic climate zones least part experience least snowfall year poleward locations oceanic climate zone subpolar oceanic climates described greater detail snowfall frequent commonplace
temperatureedit
overall temperature characteristics oceanic climates feature cool temperatures infrequent extremes temperature köppen climate classification oceanic climates mean temperature higher coldest month compared continental climates coldest month mean temperature summers cool warmest month mean temperature poleward latter zone aforementioned subpolar oceanic climate köppen cfc4 long relatively mild latitude winters cool short summers average temperatures least three months examples climate include parts coastal iceland northern hemisphere extreme southern chile argentina southern hemisphere examples include ushuaia punta arenas
causationedit
oceanic climates necessarily always found coastal locations aforementioned parallels however cases oceanic climates parallel higher middle latitude oceans polar stream moves west east direction across middle latitudes advancing pressure systems storms fronts coastal areas higher middle latitudes 45–60° latitude prevailing onshore flow creates basic structure oceanic climates oceanic climates product reflection ocean adjacent fall winter early spring polar stream active frequent passing marine weather systems creates frequent cloudy skies light drizzle often associated oceanic climates summer high pressure often pushes prevailing westerlies north many oceanic climates often creating drier summer climate example pacific northwest united states canada
north atlantic gulf stream tropical oceanic current passes north caribbean east coast united states north carolina heads eastnortheast azores thought greatly modify climate northwest europe5 result gulf stream westcoast areas located high latitudes like ireland norway much milder winters latitude would otherwise case lowland attributes western europe also help drive marine masses continental areas enabling cities dresden prague vienna maritime climates spite located well inland ocean

subtropical highland variety oceanic climate exists elevated portions world within either tropics subtropics though typically found mountainous locations tropical countries despite latitude higher altitudes regions mean climate tends share characteristics oceanic climates though also tends experience noticeably drier weather lowersun winter season locations outside tropics drying trend winter subtropical highland climates tend essentially identical oceanic climate mild summers noticeably cooler winters plus instances snowfall tropics subtropical highland climate tends feature springlike weather yearround temperatures remain relatively constant throughout year snowfall seldom seen
areas climate feature monthly averages using american standards least months average temperature without elevation many regions would likely feature either tropical humid subtropical climates regions usually designated even temperate highland

temperate cfbedit
temperate oceanic climates also known marine mild winter climates12 simply oceanic climates found either middle latitudes equatorial areas higher altitudes often found near west coast continents hence another name marine west coast climates
