history nucleic acidsedit

nuclein discovered friedrich miescher 18693
1889 richard altmann discovered nuclein acidic properties became called nucleic acid
1938 astbury bell published first xray diffraction pattern dna4
1953 watson crick determined structure dna5

experimental studies nucleic acids constitute major part modern biological medical research form foundation genome forensic science biotechnology pharmaceutical industries678
occurrence nomenclature9edit
term nucleic acid overall name members family biopolymers10 synonymous polynucleotide nucleic acids named initial discovery within nucleus presence phosphate groups related phosphoric acid11 although first discovered within nucleus eukaryotic cells nucleic acids known found life forms including within bacteria archaea mitochondria chloroplasts viruses viroids12 note debate whether viruses living nonliving living cells contain except cells mature blood cells viruses contain either usually both13 basic component biological nucleic acids nucleotide contains pentose sugar ribose deoxyribose phosphate group nucleobase14 nucleic acids also generated within laboratory enzymes15 polymerases solidphase chemical synthesis chemical methods also enable generation altered nucleic acids found nature16 example peptide nucleic acids
molecular composition size17edit
nucleic acids generally large molecules indeed molecules probably largest individual molecules known wellstudied biological nucleic acid molecules range size nucleotides small interfering large chromosomes human chromosome single molecule contains million base pairs18
cases naturally occurring molecules doublestranded molecules singlestranded19 numerous exceptions however—some viruses genomes made doublestranded viruses singlestranded genomes20 circumstances nucleic acid structures three four strands form21
nucleic acids linear polymers chains nucleotides nucleotide consists three components purine pyrimidine nucleobase sometimes termed nitrogenous base simply base pentose sugar phosphate group substructure consisting nucleobase plus sugar termed nucleoside nucleic acid types differ structure sugar nucleotides–dna contains 2deoxyribose contains ribose difference presence hydroxyl group also nucleobases found nucleic acid types different adenine cytosine guanine found thymine occurs uracil occurs
sugars phosphates nucleic acids connected alternating chain sugarphosphate backbone phosphodiester linkages17 conventional nomenclature carbons phosphate groups attach 3end 5end carbons sugar gives nucleic acids directionality ends nucleic acid molecules referred 5end 3end nucleobases joined sugars nglycosidic linkage involving nucleobase ring nitrogen pyrimidines purines carbon pentose sugar ring
nonstandard nucleosides also found usually arise modification standard nucleosides within molecule primary initial transcript transfer trna molecules contain particularly large number modified nucleosides22
topologyedit
doublestranded nucleic acids made complementary sequences extensive watsoncrick base pairing results highly repeated quite uniform doublehelical threedimensional structure23 contrast singlestranded molecules constrained regular double helix adopt highly complex threedimensional structures based short stretches intramolecular basepaired sequences including watsoncrick noncanonical base pairs wide range complex tertiary interactions24
nucleic acid molecules usually unbranched occur linear circular molecules example bacterial chromosomes plasmids mitochondrial chloroplast usually circular doublestranded molecules chromosomes eukaryotic nucleus usually linear doublestranded molecules13 molecules linear singlestranded molecules circular branched molecules result splicing reactions9the total amount pyrimidine equal total amount purines diameter helix
