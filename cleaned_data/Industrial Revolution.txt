important technological developments
commencement industrial revolution closely linked small number innovations22 beginning second half 18th century 1830s following gains made important technologies

textiles mechanised cotton spinning powered steam water increased output worker factor around power loom increased output worker factor 4023 cotton increased productivity removing seed cotton factor 5017 large gains productivity also occurred spinning weaving wool linen great cotton24
steam power efficiency steam engines increased used onefifth onetenth much fuel adaptation stationary steam engines rotary motion made suitable industrial uses25 high pressure engine high power weight ratio making suitable transportation26 steam power underwent rapid expansion 1800
iron making substitution coke charcoal greatly lowered fuel cost iron wrought iron production27 using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces2829 resulting economies scale cast iron blowing cylinder first used 1760 later improved making double acting allowed higher blast furnace temperatures puddling process produced structural grade iron lower cost finery forge30 rolling mill fifteen times faster hammering wrought iron blast 1828 greatly increased fuel efficiency iron production following decades
