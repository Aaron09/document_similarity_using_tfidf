since forces perceived pushes pulls provide intuitive understanding describing forces3 physical concepts temperature intuitive understanding forces quantified using precise operational definitions consistent direct observations compared standard measurement scale experimentation determined laboratory measurements forces fully consistent conceptual definition force offered newtonian mechanics

galileo galilei first point inherent contradictions contained aristotles description forces


dynamic equilibrium first described galileo noticed certain assumptions aristotelian physics contradicted observations logic galileo realized simple velocity addition demands concept absolute rest frame exist galileo concluded motion constant velocity completely equivalent rest contrary aristotles notion natural state rest objects mass naturally approached simple experiments showed galileos understanding equivalence constant velocity rest correct example mariner dropped cannonball crows nest ship moving constant velocity aristotelian physics would cannonball fall straight ship moved beneath thus aristotelian universe falling cannonball would land behind foot mast moving ship however experiment actually conducted cannonball always falls foot mast cannonball knows travel ship despite separated since forward horizontal force applied cannonball falls conclusion left cannonball continues move velocity boat falls thus force required keep cannonball moving constant forward velocity9
moreover object traveling constant velocity must subject zero force resultant force definition dynamic equilibrium forces object balance still moves constant velocity
simple case dynamic equilibrium occurs constant velocity motion across surface kinetic friction situation force applied direction motion kinetic friction force exactly opposes applied force results zero force since object started nonzero velocity continues move nonzero velocity aristotle misinterpreted motion caused applied force however kinetic friction taken consideration clear force causing constant velocity motion45
