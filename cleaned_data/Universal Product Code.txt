proposaledit
around late 1969 research triangle park north carolina assigned george laurer determine make supermarket scanner label late 1970 heard baumeister provided equations calculate characters inch achievable codes delta delta february 1971 baumeister joined laurer
1971 william bill crouse invented code called delta achieved four times characters inch delta delta compared widths space width code bits extremely sensitive spread much pressure would cause edges spread outward little cause shrink make worse bars spread spaces shrink vice versa delta achieved higher performance using leading leading trailing trailing edges unaffected uniform spread code provided best performance defined character fixed reference distance spanned preferably character august 1971 crouse joined scanner effort several months made progress aware bull’s label could scanned simple straight line laser scanner readable label large although litton industries proposed bull’s symbol half reduce area still large presented smear printing problems symbol redundancy checking ability removed completely also aware many proposals around world none feasible




label showing general characteristics baumeisters proposals


spring 1972 baumeister announced breakthrough proposed label bars slightly longer distance across bars needed read single pass label could scanned simple scanner slightly complex straight line laser scanner next baumeister suggested label split halves lengths could nearly half proposals reduced area bull’s third sixth image right shows label proposed baumeister specify specific code well understood except coding digits label today proposal shortly baumeister transferred another area
laurer proceeded define details label write proposal woodland assigned planner project aided laurer writing proposal
laurer’s first attempt code used delta resulting label size inches three inches large crouse suggested laurer delta code provided copy patent sample alphanumeric character rules generate size alphabets reduced label size later laurer asked crouse assistance scanner could detect label together defined guard bars definition detect label guard bars also provided identification half label discrimination training bars scanner threshold circuits laurer complete label definition proceeded write proposal9
previously crouse idea simple wand worn like ring bracelet decided develop wand provide demonstration labelcitation needed
december 1972 presented laurers proposal super market committee rochester minnesota location would develop scanner presentation crouse gave demonstration read upclike labels ring wand addition reading regular labels read large twopage centerfold label proposal booklet turned page showing photo labeled items sitting table labels small flawed resolution printed photo wand read many demonstration showed robustness pure delta code proposal accepted
month later january 1973 crouse transferred back ibms advanced technology group laurer remained full responsibility label
dymo industries makers handheld printing devices insisted code character independentclarification needed handheld printing devices could produce code store items barcoded manufacturers dymos proposal accepted incorporated ibms latest proposal
decided halves label different numeric characters character laurer derived delta patent used seven printable increments units bars spaces would printed yielded twenty combinations characters pairs read delta rules yielded code pair since eighteen characters enough laurer tried adding unit character yielded twentysix delta characters could provide sets decimal characters also added fourteen percent width label thereby height would thirty percent increase area label 17”x103” laurer felt acceptable returned original character twenty characters four pairs delta reading decided distinguish pairs would measure width pairs distinguish pair bars would units wide laurer didn’t apply baumeister’s equations felt width measurement would serious turned would required fifty percent increase width height area increase double laurer later admitted four characters responsible scanner read errors
david savir mathematician given task proving symbol could printed would meet reliability requirements likely unaware baumeister’s equations laurer added digits error correction detection decided oddeven parity number units filled bars side oddeven parity technique used detect number errors stream decided half even would provide additional indication half ticket read meant every width read accurately provide good reading also meant every space would also known requiring every width read precisely basically nullified delta advantage except delta reference measurement strange character size label remains shadow delta code size still calculated pure delta label size properly recalculated taking account required width measurements label would large acceptable
mechanical engineering electronic circuit design commonly require worst case designs using known tolerances many engineers working codes little experience things used somewhat intuitive methods cause poor performance delta code quite likely failure rca’s bull’s scanner

check digit calculationedit
formally upca check digit











displaystyle

meets check digit equation













































































































displaystyle 3x1x23x3x43x5x63x7x83x9x103x11x12equiv 0pmod



generally upca system check digit calculated follows

digits oddnumbered positions first third fifth eleventh
multiply result
digit evennumbered positions second fourth sixth tenth result
find result modulo remainder divided
result subtract result

example upca barcode 03600029145x unknown check digit calculated

oddnumbered digits
multiply result
evennumbered digits
find result modulo
result subtract result

thus check digit
note

upca detect single digit errors
