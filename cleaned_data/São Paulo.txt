paulo history actions projects plans related urban planning traced governments antonio silva prado baron duprat washington luis francisco prestes maia however general city formed 20th century growing village metropolis series informal processes irregular urban sprawl123
urban growth paulo followed three patterns since beginning 20th century according urban historians since late 19th century 1940s paulo condensed city different social groups lived small urban zone separated type housing 1940s 1980s paulo followed model centerperiphery social segregation upper middleclasses occupied central modern areas poor moved towards precarious selfbuilt housing periphery 1980s onward transformations brought social classes closer together spatial terms separated walls security technologies seek isolate richer classes name security124
thus paulo differs considerably brazilian cities belo horizonte goiânia whose initial expansion followed determinations plan city like brasília whose master plan fully developed prior construction125
effectiveness plans seen planners historians questionable scholars argue plans produced exclusively benefit wealthier strata population working classes would relegated traditional informal processes paulo mid1950s plans based idea demolish rebuild including former mayor prestes maia paulos road plan known avenues plan saturnino britos plan tietê river
plan avenues implemented 1920s sought build large avenues connecting city center outskirts plan included renewing commercial city center leading real estate speculation gentrification several downtown neighborhoods plan also expansion services would soon replace trolley preliminary transportation system126 contributed outwards expansion paulo peripherization poorer residents peripheral neighborhoods usually unregulated consisted mainly selfbuilt singlefamily houses124
1968 urban development plan proposed basic plan integrated development paulo administration figueiredo ferraz main result zoning laws lasted 2004 basic plan replaced current master plan127
zoning adopted 1972 designated areas residential areas designed elites mixed zone lacking clear definitions characteristics zoning encouraged growth suburbs minimal control major speculation128
1970s peripheral regulation increased infrastructure periphery improved driving land prices poorest newcomers unable purchase build house forced look housing alternative result favelas precarious tenements cortiços appeared129 housing types often located closer center city favelas could sprawl terrain previously utilized often dangerous unsanitary decaying abandoned buildings tenements abundant inside city favelas went back urban perimeter occupying small lots occupied urbanization—alongside polluted rivers railways bridges130
