historyedit
encoding data discrete bits used punched cards invented basile bouchon jeanbaptiste falcon 1732 developed joseph marie jacquard 1804 later adopted semen korsakov charles babbage hermann hollerith early computer manufacturers like another variant idea perforated paper tape systems medium card tape conceptually carried array hole positions position could either punched thus carrying information encoding text bits also used morse code 1844 early digital communications machines teletypes stock ticker machines 1870
ralph hartley suggested logarithmic measure information 19286 claude shannon first used word seminal 1948 paper mathematical theory communication7 attributed origin john tukey written bell labs memo january 1947 contracted binary information digit simply interestingly vannevar bush written 1936 bits information could stored punched cards used mechanical computers time8 first programmable computer built konrad zuse used binary notation numbers
physical representationedit
stored digital device physical system exists either possible distinct states stable states flipflop positions electrical switch distinct voltage current levels allowed circuit distinct levels light intensity directions magnetization polarization orientation reversible double stranded
bits implemented several forms modern computing devices usually represented electrical voltage current pulse electrical state flipflop circuit
devices using positive logic digit value logical value true represented positive voltage relative representation specific voltages different different logic families variations permitted allow component aging noise immunity example transistor–transistor logic compatible circuits digit values output device represented higher volts lower volts respectively inputs specified recognize volts volts
transmission processingedit
bits transmitted time serial transmission multiple number bits parallel transmission bitwise operation optionally process bits time data transfer rates usually measured decimal multiples unit second bits kbits
storageedit
earliest nonelectronic information processing devices jacquards loom babbages analytical engine often stored position mechanical lever gear presence absence hole specific point paper card tape first electrical devices discrete logic elevator traffic light control circuits telephone switches konrad zuses computer represented bits states electrical relays could either open closed relays replaced vacuum tubes starting 1940s computer builders experimented variety storage methods pressure pulses traveling mercury delay line charges stored inside surface cathoderay tube opaque spots printed glass discs photolithographic techniques
1950s 1960s methods largely supplanted magnetic storage devices magnetic core memory magnetic tapes drums disks represented polarity magnetization certain area ferromagnetic film change polarity direction principle later used magnetic bubble memory developed 1980s still found various magnetic strip items metro tickets credit cards
modern semiconductor memory dynamic randomaccess memory values represented levels electric charge stored capacitor certain types programmable logic arrays readonly memory represented presence absence conducting path certain point circuit optical discs encoded presence absence microscopic reflective surface onedimensional codes bits encoded thickness alternating black white lines
unit symboledit
defined international system units however international electrotechnical commission issued standard 60027 specifies symbol binary digit used multiples kbit kilobit9 however lowercase letter widely used well recommended ieee 1541 standard 2002 contrast upper case letter standard customary symbol byte

multiple bitsedit
multiple bits expressed represented several ways convenience representing commonly reoccurring groups bits information technology several units information traditionally used common unit byte coined werner buchholz june 1956 historically used represent group bits used encode single character text utf8 multibyte encoding took computer1011121314 reason used basic addressable element many computer architectures trend hardware design converged common implementation using eight bits byte widely used today however ambiguity relying underlying hardware design unit octet defined explicitly denote sequence eight bits
computers usually manipulate bits groups fixed size conventionally named words like byte number bits word also varies hardware design typically bits even specialized computers 21st century retail personal server computers word size bits
international system units defines series decimal prefixes multiples standardized units commonly also used byte prefixes kilo yotta 1024 increment multiples 1000 corresponding units kilobit kbit yottabit ybit
information capacity information compressionedit
information capacity storage system communication channel presented bits bits second often refers binary digits computer hardware capacity store binary data current information capacity storage system upper bound quantity information stored therein possible values storage equally likely storage contains less information indeed value completely predictable reading value provides information zero entropic bits resolution uncertainty occurs therefore information available computer file uses bits storage contains bits information information principle encoded bits least average principle basis data compression technology using analogy hardware binary digits refer amount storage space available like number buckets available store things information content filling comes different levels granularity fine coarse compressed uncompressed information granularity finer—when information compressed—the bucket hold
example estimated combined technological capacity world store information provides 1300 exabytes hardware digits 2007 however storage space filled corresponding content optimally compressed represents exabytes information15 optimally compressed resulting carrying capacity approaches shannon information information entropy
bitbased computingedit
certain bitwise computer processor instructions operate level manipulating bits rather manipulating data interpreted aggregate bits
1980s bitmapped computer displays became popular computers provided specialized block transfer bitblt blit instructions copy bits corresponded given rectangular area screen
computers programming languages within group bits byte word referred usually specified number upwards corresponding position within byte word however refer either least significant depending context
