historical originsedit
early work operational research carried individuals charles babbage research cost transportation sorting mail englands universal penny post 1840 studies dynamical behaviour railway vehicles defence gwrs broad gauge7 percy bridgman brought operational research bear problems physics 1920s would later attempt extend social sciences8
modern operational research originated bawdsey research station 1937 result initiative stations superintendent rowe rowe conceived idea means analyse improve working early warning radar system chain home initially analysed operating radar equipment communication networks expanding later include operating personnels behaviour revealed unappreciated limitations network allowed remedial action taken9

second world waredit
modern field operational research arose world world operational research defined scientific method providing executive departments quantitative basis decisions regarding operations control10 names included operational analysis ministry defence 196211 quantitative management12
second world close 1000 women britain engaged operational research operational research scientists worked british army13
patrick blackett worked several different organizations early working royal aircraft establishment team known circus helped reduce number antiaircraft artillery rounds needed shoot enemy aircraft average 20000 start battle britain 4000 194114
