existence precedes essenceedit
main article existence precedes essence
sartre claimed central proposition existentialism existence precedes essence means important consideration individuals individuals—independently acting responsible conscious beings existence—rather labels roles stereotypes definitions preconceived categories individuals essence actual life individuals constitutes could called true essence instead arbitrarily attributed essence others define thus human beings consciousness create values determine meaning life21 although sartre explicitly coined phrase similar notions found thought existentialist philosophers heidegger kierkegaard

subjective thinker’s form form communication style form must manifold opposites holds together systematic eins zwei drei abstract form also must inevitably trouble whenever applied concrete degree subjective thinker concrete degree form must also concretely dialectical poet ethicist dialectician also form none directly form must first last related existence regard must disposal poetic ethical dialectical religious subordinate character setting belong wellbalanced character esthetic production breadth subjective thinker setting—existence—and nothing localities things setting fairyland imagination poetry produces consummation setting laid england historical accuracy concern setting inwardness existing human concretion relation existencecategories another historical accuracy historical actuality breadth søren kierkegaard concluding postscript hong 357–58

interpret imperative define oneself meaning anyone wish anything however existentialist philosopher would wish constitutes inauthentic existence sartre would call faith instead phrase taken people defined insofar responsible actions example someone acts cruelly towards people defined cruel person furthermore action cruelty persons responsible identity cruel persons opposed genes human nature bearing blame
sartre writes work existentialism humanism first exists encounters surges world—and defines afterwards course positive therapeutic aspect also implied person choose different good person instead cruel person also clear since humans choose either cruel good fact neither things essentially22
sartres definition existentialism based heideggers magnum opus time letters heidegger implies sartre misunderstood purposes subjectivism mean actions take precedence long actions reflected upon living heidegger called average everydayness

main article facticity
facticity concept defined sartre nothingness initself delineates humans modalities easily understood considering facticity relation temporal dimension past ones past sense coconstitutes oneself however ones past would ignore significant part reality present future saying ones past would entirely detach oneself denial ones concrete past constitutes inauthentic lifestyle goes kinds facticity human body doesnt allow person faster speed sound identity values etc30
facticity limitation condition freedom limitation large part ones facticity consists things couldnt chosen birthplace condition freedom sense ones values likely depend however even though ones facticity stone past instance cannot determine person value ascribed ones facticity still ascribed freely person example consider memory past remembers everything committed many crimes first knowing nothing leads rather normal life second feeling trapped past continues life crime blaming past trapping life nothing essential committing crimes ascribes meaning past
however disregard ones facticity continual process selfmaking projects oneself future would oneself denial oneself thus would inauthentic words origin ones projection must still ones facticity though mode essentially example focusing solely ones possible projects without reflecting ones current facticity30 continually thinks future possibilities related rich better bigger house better quality life without considering facticity currently financial means example considering facticity transcendence authentic mode would considering future projects might improve ones current finances putting extra hours investing savings order arrive futurefacticity modest rise leading purchase affordable
another aspect facticity entails angst sense freedom produces angst limited facticity sense lack possibility facticity step take responsibility something done also produces angst
