three main macronutrients along carbohydrate protein1 fats also known triglycerides esters three fatty acid chains alcohol glycerol terms lipid often confused lipid general term though lipid necessarily triglyceride normally refers lipid short unsaturated fatty acid chains liquid room temperature strict sense specifically refer lipids solids room temperature however broad sense used food science synonym lipid fats like lipids generally hydrophobic soluble organic solvents insoluble water
important foodstuff many forms life fats serve structural metabolic functions necessary part diet heterotrophs including humans fatty acids free digestion fats called essential cannot synthesized body simpler constituents essential fatty acids efas human nutrition alphalinolenic acid omega3 fatty acid linoleic acid omega6 fatty acid23 lipids needed body synthesized fats fats lipids broken body enzymes called lipases produced pancreas
fats oils categorized according number bonding carbon atoms aliphatic chain fats saturated fats double bonds carbons chain unsaturated fats double bonded carbons chain nomenclature based nonacid noncarbonyl chain called omega nend thus alphalinolenic acid called omega3 fatty acid carbon first double bonded carbon chain counting oils fats multiple double bonds therefore called polyunsaturated fats unsaturated fats divided fats common nature trans fats rare nature unsaturated fats altered reaction hydrogen effected catalyst action called hydrogenation tends break double bonds makes fully saturated make vegetable shortening liquid cisunsaturated fats vegetable oils hydrogenated produce saturated fats desirable physical properties melt desirable temperature 30–40 store well whereas polyunsaturated oils rancid react oxygen however trans fats generated hydrogenation contaminants created unwanted side reaction catalyst partial hydrogenation
saturated fats stack closely packed arrangement solidify easily typically solid room temperature example animal fats tallow lard high saturated fatty acid content solids olive linseed oils hand unsaturated liquid fats serve energy sources body stores energy excess body needs immediately gram burned metabolized releases food calories kcal3 fats broken healthy body release constituents glycerol fatty acids glycerol converted glucose liver become source energy

chemical structure
main article triglyceride




example natural triglyceride three different fatty acids fatty acid saturated blue highlighted another contains double bond within carbon chain green highlighted third fatty acid polyunsaturated fatty acid highlighted contains three double bonds within carbon chain carboncarbon double bonds shown isomers


many different kinds fats variation chemical structure fats derivatives fatty acids glycerol fats glycerides particularly triglycerides triesters glycerol chain fatty acid bonded three groups glycerol reaction carboxyl fatty acid cooh alcohol three chains molecule water eliminated carbons linked bond dehydration synthesis process called esterification fats therefore esters simple visual illustration kinks angles chains straightened molecule would shape capital letter fatty acids would horizontal line glycerol backbone would vertical line joins horizontal lines fats therefore ester bonds
properties specific molecule depend particular fatty acids constitute fatty acids form family compounds composed increasing numbers carbon atoms linked zigzag chain hydrogen atoms side carbon atoms fatty acid longer chain long chains susceptible intermolecular forces attraction case waals forces longer ones melt higher temperature melting point

examples fatty acids

trans unsaturated example shown elaidic acid
unsaturated example shown oleic acid
saturated example shown stearic acid







elaidic acid principal trans unsaturated fatty acid often found partially hydrogenated vegetable oils36
oleic acid unsaturated fatty acid making 55–80 olive oil37
stearic acid saturated fatty acid found animal fats intended product full hydrogenation stearic acid neither trans carboncarbon double bonds


fatty acid chains also differ length often categorized short long

shortchain fatty acids scfa fatty acids aliphatic tails fewer carbons butyric acid4
mediumchain fatty acids mcfa fatty acids aliphatic tails 6–125 carbons form mediumchain triglycerides
longchain fatty acids lcfa fatty acids aliphatic tails carbons6
long chain fatty acids vlcfa fatty acids aliphatic tails carbons

aliphatic fatty acid chains glycerated resultant fats tails different lengths short triformin long cerotic acid hexacosanoic acid 26carbon longchain saturated fatty acid long chain fats exemplified tallow lard whose chains carbons long fats found food whether vegetable animal made medium longchain fatty acids usually equal nearly equal length many cell types either glucose fatty acids energy particular heart skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids despite longstanding assertions contrary fatty acids also used source fuel brain cellscitation needed
importance living organisms
fats also sources essential fatty acids important dietary requirement provide energy noted vitamins fatsoluble meaning digested absorbed transported conjunction fats fats play vital role maintaining healthy skin hair insulating body organs shock maintaining body temperature promoting healthy cell function also serves useful buffer host diseases particular substance whether chemical biotic reaches unsafe levels bloodstream body effectively dilute—or least maintain equilibrium of—the offending substances storing tissue helps protect vital organs time offending substances metabolized removed body means excretion urination accidental intentional bloodletting sebum excretion hair growth
adipose tissue




obese mouse left large stores adipose tissue comparison mouse normal amount adipose tissue shown right


main article adipose tissue
animals adipose tissue fatty tissue bodys means storing metabolic energy extended periods time adipocytes cells store derived diet liver metabolism energy stress cells degrade stored supply fatty acids also glycerol circulation metabolic activities regulated several hormones insulin glucagon epinephrine adipose tissue also secretes hormone leptin
location tissue determines metabolic profile visceral located within abdominal wall beneath wall abdominal muscle whereas subcutaneous located beneath skin includes located abdominal area beneath skin abdominal muscle wall visceral recently discovered significant producer signaling chemicals hormones among several involved inflammatory tissue responses resistin linked obesity insulin resistance type diabetes latter result currently controversial reputable studies supporting sides issue
fatty acids human health
dietary consumption fatty acids effects human health studies found replacing saturated fats unsaturated fats diet reduces risk cardiovascular disease example 2015 systematic review randomized control trials cochrane library concluded lifestyle advice risk cardiovascular disease lower risk population groups continue include permanent reduction dietary saturated partial replacement unsaturated fats5
numerous studies also found consumption trans fats increases risk cardiovascular disease23 harvard school public health advises replacing trans fats saturated fats monounsaturated polyunsaturated fats beneficial health6
