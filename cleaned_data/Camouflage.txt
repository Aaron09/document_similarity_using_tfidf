draco indochinensis uses several methods camouflage including disruptive coloration lying flat concealment shadow


information list camouflage methods
camouflage achieved different methods described methods contribute crypsis helping hide background mimesis motion dazzle protect without hiding methods applied combination
crypsisedit
also crypsis
crypsis means making animal military equipment hard detect ways sound scent visual crypsis achieved many different ways living underground active night well variety methods camouflage73
resemblance surroundingsedit
animals colours patterns resemble particular natural background important component camouflage environments instance treedwelling parakeets mainly green woodcocks forest floor brown speckled reedbed bitterns streaked brown buff case animals coloration matches hues habitat7475 similarly desert animals almost desert coloured tones sand buff ochre brownish grey whether mammals like gerbil fennec birds desert lark sandgrouse reptiles like skink horned viper76military uniforms generally resemble backgrounds example khaki uniforms muddy dusty colour originally chosen service south asia77many78 moths show industrial melanism including peppered moth coloration blends tree bark79 coloration insects evolved 1860 1940 match changing colour tree trunks rest pale mottled almost black polluted areas78c taken zoologists evidence camouflage influenced natural selection well demonstrating changes necessary resemble local background78

disruptive colorationedit
main article disruptive coloration




illustration principle maximum disruptive contrast hugh cott 1940


disruptive patterns strongly contrasting nonrepeating markings spots stripes break outlines animal military vehicle80 conceal telltale features especially eyes common frog81 disruptive patterns method defeat visual systems edge detection82 predators like leopard disruptive camouflage help approach prey potential prey like egyptian nightjar avoid detection predators83 disruptive patterning common military usage uniforms military vehicles disruptive patterning however always achieve crypsis animal military target given away factors like shape shine shadow848586
presence bold skin markings prove animal relies camouflage depends behaviour87 example although giraffes high contrast pattern could disruptive coloration adults extremely conspicuous open authors argued adult giraffes cryptic since standing among trees bushes hard even metres distance88 however adult giraffes move gain best view approaching predator relying size ability defend even lions rather camouflage88 different explanation implied fact young giraffes vulnerable predation adults half giraffe calves within year88 giraffe mothers hide calves spend much time lying cover mothers away feeding since presence mother nearby affect survival argued young giraffes must extremely well camouflaged supported fact coat markings strongly inherited88

eliminating shadowedit




camouflaged animals vehicles readily given away shapes shadows flange helps hide shadow pale fringe breaks averages shadow remains


animals horned lizards north america evolved elaborate measures eliminate shadow bodies flattened sides thinning edge animals habitually press bodies ground sides fringed white scales effectively hide disrupt remaining areas shadow edge body89 theory body shape horned lizards live open desert adapted minimise shadow supported species lacks fringe scales roundtail horned lizard lives rocky areas resembles rock species threatened makes look much like rock possible curving back emphasizing threedimensional shape89 species butterflies speckled wood pararge aegeria minimise shadows perched closing wings backs aligning bodies tilting side towards shadow becomes thin inconspicuous line rather broad patch90 similarly groundnesting birds including european nightjar select resting position facing sun90 elimination shadow identified principle military camouflage second world war91

main article distractive camouflage
many prey animals conspicuous highcontrast markings paradoxically attract predators gazed92 distractive markings serve camouflage distracting predators attention recognising prey whole example keeping predator identifying preys outline experimentally search times blue tits increased artificial prey distractive markings93
selfdecorationedit
animals actively seek hide decorating materials twigs sand pieces shell environment break outlines conceal features bodies match backgrounds example caddis larva builds decorated case lives almost entirely inside decorator crab covers back seaweed sponges stones73 nymph predatory masked uses hind legs tarsal decorate body sand dust layers bristles trichomes body nymph spreads inner layer fine particles outer layer coarser particles camouflage conceal predators prey9495
similar principles applied military purposes instance sniper wears ghillie suit designed camouflaged decoration materials tufts grass snipers immediate environment suits used early 1916 british army adopted coats motley stripes paint snipers96 cott takes example larva blotched emerald moth fixes screen fragments leaves specially hooked bristles argue military camouflage uses method pointing device essentially widely practised great concealment caterpillars caterpillartractors battery positions observation posts forth9798

countershadingedit
main article countershading




countershading acts form camouflage painting selfshadowing body object result flat appearance instead solid appearance body countershading


countershading uses graded colour counteract effect selfshadowing creating illusion flatness selfshadowing makes animal appear darker grading light dark countershading paints tones darkest lightest making countershaded animal nearly invisible suitable background121 thayer observed animals painted nature darkest parts tend lighted skys light vice versa accordingly principle countershading sometimes called thayers law122 countershading widely used terrestrial animals gazelles123 grasshoppers marine animals sharks dolphins124 birds snipe dunlin125126

transparencyedit




many animals open like aurelia labiata jellyfish largely transparent


many marine animals float near surface highly transparent giving almost perfect camouflage136 however transparency difficult bodies made materials different refractive indices seawater marine animals jellyfish gelatinous bodies composed mainly water thick mesogloea acellular highly transparent conveniently makes buoyant also makes large muscle mass cannot swim fast making form camouflage costly tradeoff mobility136 gelatinous planktonic animals percent transparent transparency percent enough make animal invisible predator depth metres 2130 better transparency required invisibility shallower water light brighter predators better example prey percent transparent optimal lighting shallow water therefore sufficient transparency camouflage easily achieved deeper waters136

transparency cannot achieved imitated effectively silvering make animals body highly reflective medium depths light comes mirror oriented vertically makes animals fish invisible side fish upper ocean sardine herring camouflaged silvering139
marine hatchetfish extremely flattened laterally leaving body millimetres thick body silvery resemble aluminium foil mirrors consist microscopic structures similar used provide structural coloration stacks crystals guanine spaced wavelength apart interfere constructively achieve nearly cent reflection deep waters hatchetfish lives blue light wavelength nanometres percolates needs reflected mirrors nanometres apart provide good camouflage139
fish herring live shallower water mirrors must reflect mixture wavelengths fish accordingly crystal stacks range different spacings complication fish bodies rounded crosssection mirrors would ineffective laid flat skin would fail reflect horizontally overall mirror effect achieved many small reflectors oriented vertically139 silvering found marine animals well fish cephalopods including squid octopus cuttlefish multilayer mirrors made protein rather guanine139

mimesis also called masquerade camouflaged object looks like something else special interest observer140 mimesis common prey animals example peppered moth caterpillar mimics twig grasshopper mimics leaf141 also found nest structures eusocial wasps leipomeles dorsata build nest envelope patterns mimic leaves surrounding nest142
mimesis also employed predators parasites lure prey example flower mantis mimics particular kind flower orchid143 tactic occasionally used warfare example heavily armed qships disguised merchant ships144145146
