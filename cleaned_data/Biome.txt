history concept
term suggested 1916 clements originally synonym biotic community möbius 18774 later gained current definition based earlier concepts phytophysiognomy formation vegetation used opposition flora inclusion animal element exclusion taxonomic element species composition56 1935 tansley added climatic soil aspects idea calling ecosystem78 international biological program 1964–74 projects popularized concept biome9
however contexts term biome used different manner german literature particularly walter terminology term used similarly biotope concrete geographical unit biome definition used article used international nonregional terminology irrespectively continent area present takes biome name corresponds zonobiome orobiome pedobiome biomes determinated climate zone altitude soil10
brazilian literature term biome sometimes used synonym biogeographic province area based species composition term floristic province used plant species considered also synonym morphoclimatic phytogeographical domain absáber geographic space subcontinental dimensions predominance similar geomorphologic climatic characteristics certain vegetation form includes many biomes fact51112

whittaker classified biomes using abiotic factors precipitation temperature scheme seen simplification holdridges readily accessible missing holdridges greater specificity
whittaker based approach theoretical assertions empirical sampling unique position make holistic assertion previously compiled review biome classifications18
definitions understanding whittakers scheme

physiognomy apparent characteristics outward features appearance ecological communities species
biome grouping terrestrial ecosystems given continent similar vegetation structure physiognomy features environment characteristics animal communities
formation major kind community plants given continent
biometype grouping convergent biomes formations different continents defined physiognomy
formationtypea grouping convergent formations

whittakers distinction biome formation simplified formation used applied plant communities biome used concerned plants animals whittakers convention biometype formationtype simply broader method categorize similar communities19
whittakers parameters classifying biometypes
whittaker seeing need simpler express relationship community structure environment used called gradient analysis ecocline patterns relate communities climate worldwide scale whittaker considered four main ecoclines terrestrial realm19

intertidal levels wetness gradient areas exposed alternating water dryness intensities vary location high tide
climatic moisture gradient
temperature gradient altitude
temperature gradient latitude

along gradients whittaker noted several trends allowed qualitatively establish biometypes

gradient runs favorable extreme corresponding changes productivity
changes physiognomic complexity vary favorable environment exists decreasing community structure reduction stratal differentiation environment becomes less favorable
trends diversity structure follow trends species diversity alpha beta species diversities decrease favorable extreme environments
growthform grasses shrubs characteristic place maximum importance along ecoclines
growth forms dominant similar environments widely different parts world

whittaker summed effects gradients overall temperature gradient combined gradient moisture gradient express conclusions known whittaker classification scheme scheme graphs average annual precipitation xaxis versus average annual temperature yaxis classify biometypes
