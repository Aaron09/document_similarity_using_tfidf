criticisms rousseauedit




portrait rousseau later life


first criticize rousseau fellow philosophes voltaire according jacques barzun voltaire annoyed first discourse outraged second voltaires reading second discourse rousseau would like reader walk fours befitting savage121
barzun states contrary myth rousseau primitivist

model independent farmer free superiors selfgoverning cause enough philosophes hatred former friend rousseaus unforgivable crime rejection graces luxuries civilized existence voltaire sung superfluous necessary thing high bourgeois standard living rousseau would substitute middling peasants country versus city—an exasperating idea amazing fact every work rousseaus huge success whether subject politics theater education religion novel love122

early 1788 madame staël published letters works character rousseau123 1819 famous speech ancient modern liberty political philosopher benjamin constant proponent constitutional monarchy representative democracy criticized rousseau rather radical followers specifically abbé mably allegedly believing everything give collective restrictions individual rights would amply compensated participation social powercitation needed
frederic bastiat severely criticized rousseau several works notably analyzing rousseaus passages stated

part persons play merely machine motion fact merely considered material machine made thus relationship exists legislator prince exists agricultural expert farmer relationship prince subjects farmer land high mankind writer public affairs placed124

bastiat strongly believed rousseau wished ignore forms social order created people people thoughtless mass philosophers shape bastiat considered thinkers associated austrian school economics precursors spontaneous order125 presented vision considered natural order presented simple economic chain multiple parties might live different states likely even know cooperate fulfill others needs accordance basic economic laws laws supply demand chain order produce clothing multiple parties independently farmers fertilize cultivate land order produce fodder sheep another person shear several different persons transport wool turn cloth another tailor sell persons engage economic exchange nature dont need ordered efforts need centrally coordinated chains present every branch human activity individuals produce exchange goods services together naturally create complex social order require external inspiration central coordination efforts form bureaucratic control benefit society whole according bastiat proof humanity capable creating complex socioeconomic order might likely superior arbitrary vision philosopher126
bastiat also believed rousseau contradicted presenting views concerning human nature nature sufficiently invincible regain empire would need philosophers direct back natural conversely believed humanity accordance natural instincts would choose would chosen left alone accordance laws economy human nature itself127
another point criticism raised bastiat whether better state nature working isolation bastiat provided example laborer time thanks division labor free society easily obtain several pieces clothing bread shelter division labor leaves producing cots others bread others building shelters benefits pain obtaining things alone without cooperation bastiat concluded returning illusionary state nature economic sense rousseau means essentially isolation efforts would doom mankind force suffer unncesessary hardships128
rousseaus sociological political concepts discourse inequality social contract state nature civilization catalyst corruption evil humans signing contract mutually give freedoms protection rights part implicitly parodied inspiration marquis sade particularly justine misfortunes virtue 1791 comte gernande justine instance thérèse asks justifies abusing torturing women states

necessity mutually render another happy cannot legitimately exist save persons equally furnished capacity another hurt consequently persons commensurate strength association never come unless contract pacte immediately formed persons obligates employ kind force injurious either sort fool would stronger order subscribe agreement129

edmund burke formed unfavorable impression rousseau latter visited england hume later drew connection rousseaus egoistic philosophy personal vanity saying rousseau entertained principle vanity vice possessed degree little short madness130
1919 irving babbitt founder movement called humanism wrote critique called sentimental humanitarianism blamed rousseau131 babbitts depiction rousseau countered celebrated much reprinted essay lovejoy 1923132page needed france fascist theorist charles maurras founder action française compunctions laying blame romantisme révolution firmly rousseau 1922133
cold rousseau criticized association nationalism attendant abuses example talmon jacob leib 1952 origins totalitarian democracy came known among scholars totalitarian thesis political scientist maloy states twentieth century added nazism stalinism jacobinism list horrors rousseau could blamed rousseau considered advocated sort invasive tampering human nature totalitarian regimes midcentury tried instantiate adds totalitarian thesis rousseau studies discredited attribution real historical influence134
arthur melzer however conceding rousseau would approved modern nationalism observes theories contain seeds nationalism insofar forth politics identification rooted sympathetic emotion melzer also believes admitting peoples talents unequal rousseau therefore tacitly condones tyranny many135 others counter however rousseau concerned concept equality equality talentscitation needed stephen engel hand rousseaus nationalism anticipated modern theories imagined communities transcend social religious divisions within states136
similar grounds rousseaus strongest critics second half 20th century political philosopher hannah arendt using rousseaus thought example arendt identified notion sovereignty general according desire establish single unified based stifling opinion favor public passion contributed excesses french revolution137
