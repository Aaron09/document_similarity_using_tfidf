telephone operator manually connecting calls cord pairs telephone switchboard






modern central office equipped voice communication broadband data


telephone exchange telecommunications system used public switched telephone network large enterprises exchange consists electronic components older systems also human operators interconnect switch telephone subscriber lines virtual circuits digital systems establish telephone calls subscribers
historical perspective telecommunication terms used different semantics time term telephone exchange often used synonymously central office bell system term often central office defined building used house inside plant equipment potentially several telephone exchanges serving certain geographical area area also referred exchange central office locations also identified north america wire centers designating facility telephone obtains dial tone1 business billing purposes telephony carriers also define rate centers larger cities clusters central offices define specified geographical locations determining distance measurements
united states canada bell system established 1940s uniform system identifying central offices threedigit central office code used prefix subscriber telephone numbers central offices within larger region typically aggregated state assigned common numbering plan area code development international transoceanic telephone trunks especially driven direct customer dialing similar efforts systematic organization telephone networks occurred many countries mid20th century
corporate enterprise private telephone exchange often referred private branch exchange connections public switched telephone network installed enterprise facilities typically collocated large office spaces within organizational campus serve local private telephone system private leased line circuits smaller installations might deploy telephone system office receptionist

telephone exchange telephone system located service centers central offices responsible small geographic area provided switching interconnection individual subscriber lines calls made rather requiring direct lines subscriber stations made possible subscribers call homes businesses public spaces made telephony available comfortable communication tool everyday gave impetus creation whole industrial sector
first propose telephone exchange hungarian tivadar puskás 1877 working thomas edison45678 first experimental telephone exchange based ideas puskás built bell telephone company boston 18779 worlds first commercial telephone exchange opened november 1877 friedrichsberg close berlin10 george designed built first commercial telephone exchange opened connecticut january 1878 switchboard built carriage bolts handles teapot lids bustle wire could handle simultaneous conversations11 charles glidden also credited establishing exchange lowell subscribers 1878
europe early telephone exchanges based london manchester opened bell patents 187912 belgium first international bell exchange antwerp year later
1887 puskás introduced multiplex switchboardvague
later exchanges consisted several hundred plug boards staffed switchboard operators operator front vertical panel containing banks ¼inch tipringsleeve 3conductor jacks local termination subscribers telephone line front jack panel horizontal panel containing rows patch cords pair connected cord circuit

early manual switchboards required operator operate listening keys ringing keys late 1910s 1920s advances switchboard technology features allowed call automatically answered immediately operator inserted answering cord ringing would automatically begin soon operator inserted ringing cord called party’s jack operator would disconnected circuit allowing handle another call caller heard audible ringback signal operator would periodically report continuing ring line15
ringdown method originating operator called another intermediate operator would call called subscriber passed another intermediate operator16 chain intermediate operators could complete call intermediate trunk lines available centers time 1943 military calls priority crosscountry call might take long hours request schedule cities used manual switchboards toll calls
march 1891 almon brown strowger undertaker kansas city missouri patented stepping switch device automation telephone circuit switching many extensions adaptations initial patent best known consists levels banks contacts arranged semicircle used rotary telephone dial pair digits caused shaft central contact hand stepping switch first step ratchet level pulse first digit swing horizontally contact small rotation pulse next digit
later stepping switches arranged banks first stage linefinder hundred subscriber lines receiver lifted hook linefinder connected subscribers line free first selector returned subscriber dial tone show ready receive dialed digits subscribers dial pulsed pulses second although speed depended standard particular telephone administration
exchanges based strowger switch eventually challenged exchange types later crossbar technology exchange designs promised faster switching would accept pulses faster strowgers typical pps—typically later date many also accepted dtmf touch tones tone signaling systems

many terms used telecommunication technology differ meaning usage among various english speaking regions purpose article following definitions made

manual service condition human telephone operator routes calls inside exchange without dial
dial service exchange routes calls switch interpreting dialed digits
telephone switch switching equipment exchange

bell system trunks common pulsepersecond crossbar switches crossbar tandems twice rate western electricbell system telephone dials using faster pulsing rate made trunk utilization efficient switch spent half long listening digits dtmf used trunk signaling
multifrequency last predigital methods used different tones sent pairs like dtmf dialing preceded special keypulse signal followed start variations bell system tone scheme became ccitt standard similar schemes used americas european countries including spain digit strings switches often abbreviated improve utilization
example switch might send last four five digits telephone number case seven digit numbers preceded digit differentiate area codes office codes twodigitpercall savings improved revenue trunk reduced number digit receivers needed switch every task electromechanical switches done metallic pieces hardware every fractional second call time meant fewer racks equipment handle call traffic
examples signals communicating supervision call progress include signaling signaling robbedbit signaling physical carrier trunk circuits trunks four wire fifty trunks would require hundred pair cable switches example conductors common circuit configuration named ring mouth ring voicecarrying pair named ring three conductor cords manual operators console
twoway trunks signaling handshake took place prevent switches colliding dialing calls trunk time changing state leads ground volts switches stepped handshake protocol using voltage changes local switch would send signal ready call remote switch would reply acknowledgment ahead dial pulsing done relay logic discrete electronics
voltage changes trunk circuit would cause pops clicks audible subscriber electrical handshaking stepped protocol another handshake start timing billing purposes caused second clunks called party answered
