indigenous american communities narratives storytelling often told number elders community stories never static shaped relationship narrator audience thus individual story countless variations narrators often incorporate minor changes story order tailor story different audiences9
aesthetics approachedit
narrative highly aesthetic thoughtfully composed stories number aesthetic elements elements include idea narrative structure identifiable beginnings middles ends expositiondevelopmentclimaxdenouement coherent plot lines strong focus temporality including retention past attention present action protentionfuture anticipation substantial focus character characterization arguably important single component novel david lodge fiction different voices interacting sound human voice many voices speaking variety accents rhythms registers lodge fiction also theory mikhail bakhtin expansion idea narrator narratorlike voice addresses interacts reading audiences reader response theory communicates wayne boothesque rhetorical thrust dialectic process interpretation times beneath surface forming plotted narrative times much visible arguing various positions relies substantially literary tropes hayden white metahistory expansion idea often intertextual literatures commonly demonstrates effort toward bildungsroman description identity development effort evince becoming character communityjargon

inquiry approachedit
order avoid hardened stories narratives become contextfree portable ready used anywhere anytime illustrative purposes used conceptual metaphors defined linguist george lakoff approach called narrative inquiry proposed resting epistemological assumption human beings make sense random complex multicausal experience imposition story structures1617 human propensity simplify data predilection narratives complex data sets typically leads narrative fallacy easier human mind remember make decisions basis stories meaning remember strings data reason narratives powerful many classics humanities social sciences written narrative format humans read meaning data compose stories even unwarranted narrative inquiry avoid narrative fallacy different avoid error scholarly research applying usual methodical checks validity reliability data collected analyzed presentedcitation needed several criteria assessing validity narrative research proposed including objective aspect emotional aspect socialmoral aspect clarity story

musicedit
linearity several narrative qualities found musical composition23 noted american musicologist edward cone narrative terms also present analytical language music24 different components fugue subject answer exposition discussion summary cited example25 however several views concept narrative music role plays theory theodore adorno suggested ‘music recites context narrates without narrative’25 another carolyn abbate suggested ‘certain gestures experienced music constitute narrating voice’24 still others argued narrative semiotic enterprise enrich musical analysis25 french musicologist jeanjacques nattiez contends ‘the narrative strictly speaking music plot imagined constructed listeners’26 argues discussing music terms narrativity simply metaphorical ‘imagined plot’ influenced works title programmatic information provided composer26 however abbate revealed numerous examples musical devices function narrative voices limiting music’s ability narrate rare ‘moments identified bizarre disruptive effect’26 various theorists share view narrative appearing disruptive rather normative moments music final word said regarding narratives music still much determined

american indian elders also state storytelling invites listeners especially children draw conclusions perspectives selfreflecting upon lives30 furthermore insist narratives help children grasp obtain wide range perspectives help interpret lives context story american indian community members emphasize children method obtaining knowledge found stories passed generation moreover community members also children interpret build different perspective story30
historiographyedit
historiography according lawrence stone narrative traditionally main rhetorical device used historians 1979 time social history demanding socialscience model analysis stone detected move back toward narrative stone defined narrative organized chronologically focused single coherent story descriptive rather analytical concerned people abstract circumstances dealing particular specific rather collective statistical reported historians trying discover going inside peoples heads past like live past questions inevitably lead back narrative34
philosophers identify narratives type explanation mark bevir argues example narratives explain actions appealing beliefs desires actors locating webs beliefs context historical traditions narrative alternative form explanation associated natural science
historians committed social science approach however criticized narrowness narrative preference anecdote analysis clever examples rather statistical regularities35
storytelling rightsedit
storytelling rights notably important genre personal experience narrative english academics academic disciplines english performance folklore literature anthropology cultural studies social sciences interested exploring storytelling rights storytelling rights hinges ethics
storytelling rights retelling people’s stories explored asking questions like whose story story used story promise empathy redemption meaning whose benefit ethics storytelling rights— includes empathy representation— helps people organizations media government agencies clearly understand stories personal experience narratives achieve status authenticity representation36 violating representation storytelling rights creates negative repercussions individuals engaging storytelling process also damages social order like communities institutions networks people involved “voice” used powerful tool agency advocacy
misrepresentation voice often leads misunderstanding exploitation storytelling rights example would stories abused women women told government agencies telling stories heard helped truth irony domestic violence become ‘big business system listen voices battered women37 example illustrates women reshape stories gain assistance shelter charities women reshaping stories violates ethics storytelling rights fuels “big business” domestic violence
another study hurricane katrina survivors media misrepresented voices survivors manipulated public negative media press turned whole country community desperately needed help journalist reshaped stories survivors television broadcasts newspaper articles nevertheless study contradicted media used voice” prove media misrepresented stories survivors38 article readers learned media actually misrepresenting community orleans truth heard “voice” survivors people’s stories revealed community actually helping destructive time
empathy important aspect storytelling rights audience empathy towards story less chance violating ethics empathy presumes ability understand another’s life story opposite inability empathize reserved situations normal person cannot imagine including notably unspeakable evils insanity empathy describes sphere normal allows imagine normal person would do36 words listener narrative able comprehend story without empathy empathy important component concerning storytelling rights
examples domestic violence women survivors hurricane katrina show stories reshaped either narrators others highlights important issue regarding ethics storytelling rights narration listener audience infringes storytelling rights sometimes listening “voice” teller ultimately narrator reshapes story “voice” becomes lost muddled ears audience logically narrator’s voice adequately represented ethics storytelling rights honored
