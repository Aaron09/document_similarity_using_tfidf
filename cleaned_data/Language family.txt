language family group languages related descent common ancestral language parental language called protolanguage family term family reflects tree model language origination historical linguistics makes metaphor comparing languages people biological family tree subsequent modification species phylogenetic tree evolutionary taxonomy linguists therefore describe daughter languages within language family genetically related1
according ethnologue 7099 living human languages distributed different language families2 living language simply used primary form communication group people also many dead extinct languages well still insufficiently studied classified even unknown outside respective speech communities
membership languages language family established comparative linguistics sister languages said genetic genealogical relationship latter term older3 speakers language family belong common speech community divergence protolanguage daughter languages typically occurs geographical separation original speech community gradually evolving distinct linguistic units individuals belonging speech communities also adopt languages different language family language shift process4
genealogically related languages present shared retentions features protolanguage reflexes features cannot explained chance borrowing convergence membership branch group within language family established shared innovations common features languages found common ancestor entire family example germanic languages germanic share vocabulary grammatical features believed present protoindoeuropean language features believed innovations took place protogermanic descendant protoindoeuropean source germanic languages

structure familyedit
language families divided smaller phylogenetic units conventionally referred branches family history language family often represented tree diagram family monophyletic unit members derive common ancestor attested descendants ancestor included family thus term family analogous biological term clade
taxonomists restrict term family certain level little consensus affix labels also subdivide branches groups groups complexes toplevel largest family often called phylum stock closer branches closer languages related means branch protolanguage branches also sister language fourth branch sister languages closely related common ancestral protolanguage
term macrofamily superfamily sometimes applied proposed groupings language families whose status phylogenetic units generally considered unsubstantiated accepted historical linguistic methods example celtic germanic slavic romance indoiranian language families branches larger indoeuropean language family remarkably similar pattern shown linguistic tree genetic tree human ancestry5 verified statistically6 languages interpreted terms putative phylogenetic tree human languages transmitted great extent vertically ancestry opposed horizontally spatial diffusion7
dialect continuaedit
main article dialect continuum
closely knit language families many branches within larger families take form dialect continua clearcut borders make possible unequivocally identifying defining counting individual languages within family however differences speech different regions extremes continuum great mutual intelligibility occurs arabic continuum cannot meaningfully seen single language
speech variety also considered either language dialect depending social political considerations thus different sources especially time give wildly different numbers languages within certain family classifications japonic family example range language language isolate dialects nearly twenty—until classification ryukyuan separate languages within japonic language family rather dialects japanese japanese language considered language isolate therefore language family
isolatesedit
main article language isolate
worlds languages known related others known relatives family relationships tentatively proposed called language isolates essentially language families consisting single language example basque general assumed language isolates relatives relatives point history time depth great linguistic comparison recover
language isolated branch within family armenian within indoeuropean often also called isolate meaning word isolate cases usually clarified modifier instance armenian referred indoeuropean isolate contrast known basque language absolute isolate shown related language despite numerous attempts another wellknown isolate mapudungun mapuche language araucanían language family chile language said isolate currently historically related extinct relatives attested aquitanian language spoken roman times ancestor basque could also sister language ancestor basque latter case basque aquitanian would form small family together ancestors considered distinct members family
protolanguagesedit
main article protolanguage
protolanguage also referred mother language mother tongue person exposed birth8 common ancestor language family seldom known directly since languages relatively short recorded history however possible recover many features protolanguage applying comparative method reconstructive procedure worked 19th century linguist august schleicher demonstrate validity many proposed families list language families example reconstructible common ancestor indoeuropean language family called protoindoeuropean protoindoeuropean attested written records conjectured spoken invention writing
sometimes however protolanguage identified historically known language instance dialects norse protolanguage norwegian swedish danish faroese icelandic likewise appendix probi depicts protoromance language almost unattested prestige classical latin highly stylised literary register representative speech ordinary people
although many languages related protolanguage mean speakers language necessarily understand cases speakers language able understand successfully communicate sister languages also cases onesided meaning communicator able understand language cannot example would many spanish speakers understand italian however italians unable comprehend spanish speakers saying languages share protolanguage bits understood

sprachbundedit
main article sprachbund
shared innovations acquired borrowing means considered genetic bearing language family concept asserted example many striking features shared italic languages latin oscan umbrian might well areal features however similarlooking alterations systems long vowels west germanic languages greatly postdate possible notion protolanguage innovation cannot readily regarded areal either since english continental west germanic linguistic area similar vein many similar unique innovations germanic baltic slavic likely areal features traceable common protolanguage legitimate uncertainty whether shared innovations areal features coincidence inheritance common ancestor leads disagreement proper subdivisions large language family
sprachbund geographic area several languages feature common linguistic structures similarities languages caused language contact chance common origin recognized criteria define language family example sprachbund would indian subcontinent
contact languagesedit
main articles mixed language creole language
concept language families based historical observation languages develop dialects time diverge distinct languages however linguistic ancestry less clearcut familiar biological ancestry species crossbreed like evolution microbes extensive lateral gene transfer quite distantly related languages affect language contact extreme cases lead languages single ancestor whether creoles mixed languages addition number sign languages developed isolation appear relatives nonetheless cases relatively rare wellattested languages unambiguously classified belonging language family another even familys relation families known
