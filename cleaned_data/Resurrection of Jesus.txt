historical eventedit
testament scholar theologian sanders argues concerted plot foster belief resurrection would probably resulted consistent story involved events gave lives belief sanders offers hypothesis saying seems competition women first didnt on33 defending historicity resurrection sanders goes state jesus’ followers later paul resurrection experiences judgment fact reality gave rise experiences know34
james dunn writes whereas apostle pauls resurrection experience visionary character nonphysical nonmaterial accounts gospels different contends massive realismof gospel appearances described visionary great difficulty luke would certainly reject description inappropriate earliest conception resurrection jerusalem christian community physical35 conversely helmut koester writes stories resurrection originally epiphanies disciples called ministry risen jesus interpreted physical proof event secondary stage contends detailed accounts resurrection also secondary come historically trustworthy sources instead belong genre narrative types36
wright argues account empty tomb visionary experiences point towards historical reality resurrection37 suggests multiple lines evidence testament early christian beliefs reflects shows would highly unlikely belief empty tomb would simply appear without clear basis memory early christians tandem historically certain visionary experiences early disciples apostles jesus resurrection historical reality becomes plausible wright treats resurrection historical accessible event rather supernatural metaphysical event
summarizing traditional analysis catholic church stated catechism although resurrection historical event could verified sign empty tomb reality apostles encounters risen christ still remains heart mystery faith something transcends surpasses history38
metaphoredit
book first coming kingdom became christianity thomas sheehan argues even pauls account resurrection meant taken referring literal physical rising grave stories bodily resurrection appear much half century following crucifixion39 instead sheehan believes pauls understanding resurrection perhaps peters well metaphysical stories jesuss figurative resurrection reflecting triumphant entry gods eschatological presence40 pauls reference jesus risen third corinthians chronological designation apocalyptic symbol gods eschatological saving strictly speaking date history thus third refer sunday april moment time regards place resurrection occurred formula first corinthians assert jesus raised tomb raising physical therefore temporal resuscitation without committed preternatural physics resurrection phrase raised third simply expresses belief jesus rescued fate utter absence death admitted saving presence eschatological future41

peter kirby founder earlychristianwritingscom states many scholars doubt historicity empty tomb43a according robert price christian apologists love make claims resurrection jesus best attested event history probabilistic arguments show resurrection anything openandshut case44 robert greg cavin professor philosophy religious studies cypress college states sources potential evidence testament easter traditions fall short providing kind information necessary establishing resurrection hypothesis45b
biblical scholar géza vermes analyzes subject book resurrection concludes eight possible theories explain resurrection jesus vermes outlines boundaries follows

discounted extremes susceptible rational judgment blind faith fundamentalist believer outofhand rejection inveterate skeptic fundamentalists accept story written testament texts reshaped transmitted interpreted church tradition smooth rough edges abstain asking tiresome questions unbelievers turn treat whole resurrection story figment early christian imagination inquirers smattering knowledge history religions find poles46

analysis vermes presents remaining possibilities explain resurrection jesus account body removed someone unconnected jesus body jesus stolen disciples empty tomb tomb jesus buried alive jesus later left tomb jesus recovered coma departed judea possibility spiritual bodily resurrection vermes states none possibilities likely historical47
according wright book resurrection question paul firm believer bodily resurrection stands fellow jews massed ranks pagans fellow pharisees jews48 according gary habermas many scholars spoken support bodily notion jesus’ resurrection49
habermas also argues three facts support pauls belief physical resurrection body paul pharisee therefore unlike sadducees believes physical resurrection philippians paul says attain anastasis outresurrection dead according habermas means goes comes philippians 320–21 look heaven jesus change vile soma body like unto soma body according habermas paul meant would change spiritual body paul would used greek pneuma instead soma50 although others argue body soma spirit body necessarily flesh order body according pauls words corinthians regarding spiritual body true resurrection nonetheless51
flavius josephus 37–c roman citizen worked patronage emperor vespasian titus wrote antiquities jews contains passage known testimonium flavianum passage mentions john baptist jesus holy among jews52 modern scholars believe original text work changed christian editors text mentions death resurrection jesus pilate upon accusation first amongst condemned jesus crucified formerly loved cease follow appeared third living divine prophets foretold along myriad marvellous things concerning him53
various arguments historicity resurrection story example number historical figures gods similar death resurrection accounts pointed out54c however majority consensus among biblical scholars genre gospels kind ancient biography myth55 robert price claims resurrection could fact proven science historical evidence event would lose miraculous qualities54 focused argument carrier asserts surviving evidence legal historical suggests jesus formally buried friday night placed saturday night special public graveyard reserved convicts theory women visited tomb sunday morning mistook vacancy56
testament historian bart ehrman recognizes scholars argued plausible fact jesus placed common burial plot sometimes happened many crucified people simply left eaten scavenging animals elaborates saying accounts fairly unanimous saying earliest accounts unanimous saying jesus fact buried fellow joseph arimathea relatively reliable thats happened57
