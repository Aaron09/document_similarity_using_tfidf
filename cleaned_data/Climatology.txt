average temperature years data sets formed longterm average historical weather parameters sometimes called climatology


climatology approached various ways paleoclimatology seeks reconstruct past climates examining records cores tree rings dendroclimatology paleotempestology uses records help determine hurricane frequency millennia study contemporary climates incorporates meteorological data accumulated many years records rainfall temperature atmospheric composition knowledge atmosphere dynamics also embodied models either statistical mathematical help integrating different observations testing together modeling used understanding past present potential future climates historical climatology study climate related human history thus focuses last thousand years
climate research made difficult large scale long time periods complex processes govern climate climate governed physical laws expressed differential equations equations coupled nonlinear approximate solutions obtained using numerical methods create global climate models climate sometimes modeled stochastic process generally accepted approximation processes otherwise complicated analyze
