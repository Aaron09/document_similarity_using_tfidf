effects precessionedit




right ascension blue declination green seen outside celestial sphere


main article axial precession
earths axis rotates slowly westward poles ecliptic completing circuit 26000 years effect known precession causes coordinates stationary celestial objects change continuously rather slowly therefore equatorial coordinates including declination inherently relative year observation astronomers specify reference particular year known epoch coordinates different epochs must mathematically rotated match match standard epoch4
currently used standard epoch j20000 january 2000 1200 prefix indicates julian epoch prior j20000 astronomers used successive besselian epochs b18750 b19000 b195005
starsedit
stars direction remains nearly fixed vast distance right ascension declination change gradually precession equinoxes proper motion cyclically annual parallax declinations solar system objects change rapidly compared stars orbital motion close proximity
seen locations earths northern hemisphere celestial objects declinations greater observers latitude appear circle daily around celestial pole without dipping horizon therefore called circumpolar stars similarly occurs southern hemisphere objects declinations less negative −90° always negative number southern latitudes extreme example pole star declination near circumpolar seen anywhere northern hemisphere except close equator
circumpolar stars never horizon conversely stars never rise horizon seen given point earths surface except extremely close equator flat terrain distance within varies based observer altitude surrounding terrain generally star whose declination circumpolar observer either positive negative star whose declination never rises horizon seen observer neglects effect atmospheric refraction likewise star circumpolar observer latitude never rises horizon seen observer latitude
neglecting atmospheric refraction declination always east west points horizon north point south point −90° poles declination uniform around entire horizon approximately

relation latitudeedit
object directly overhead declination almost always within degree observers latitude would exactly equal except complications6citation needed
first complication applies celestial objects objects declination equals observers astronomic latitude term latitude ordinarily means geodetic latitude latitude maps devices continental united states surrounding area difference vertical deflection typically arcseconds arcsecond 13600 degree great arcseconds7
second complication assuming deflection vertical overhead means perpendicular ellipsoid observers location perpendicular line pass center earth almanacs give declinations measured center earth ellipsoid approximation level mathematically manageable8 moon discrepancy reach 0003 degree planets hundreds times distant discrepancy proportionately smaller stars unmeasurable
