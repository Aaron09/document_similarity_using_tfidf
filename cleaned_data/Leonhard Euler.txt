euler arrived saint petersburg 1727 promoted junior post medical department academy position mathematics department lodged daniel bernoulli often worked close collaboration euler mastered russian settled life saint petersburg also took additional medic russian navy15
academy saint petersburg established peter great intended improve education russia close scientific western europe result made especially attractive foreign scholars like euler academy possessed ample financial resources comprehensive library drawn private libraries peter nobility students enrolled academy order lessen facultys teaching burden academy emphasized research offered faculty time freedom pursue scientific questions11
academys benefactress catherine continued progressive policies late husband died eulers arrival russian nobility gained power upon ascension twelveyearold peter nobility suspicious academys foreign scientists thus funding caused difficulties euler colleagues
conditions improved slightly death peter euler swiftly rose ranks academy made professor physics 1731 years later daniel bernoulli censorship hostility faced saint petersburg left basel euler succeeded head mathematics department16
