nerve supplyedit
afferent nerves supplying uterus sympathetic supply hypogastric plexus ovarian plexus parasympathetic supply second third fourth sacral nerves
developmentedit

various congenital conditions uterus develop utero though uncommon double uterus didelphic uterus bicornate uterus others17
functionedit
reproductive function uterus accept fertilized ovum passes uterotubal junction fallopian tube uterine tube fertilized ovum divides become blastocyst implants endometrium derives nourishment blood vessels develop exclusively purpose fertilized ovum becomes embryo attaches wall uterus creates placenta develops fetus gestates childbirth anatomical barriers pelvis uterus pushed partially abdomen expansion pregnancy even pregnancy mass human uterus amounts kilogram pounds
uterus also plays role sexual response directing blood flow pelvis ovaries external genitals including vagina labia clitoris
clinical significanceedit
hysterectomy surgical removal uterus carried number reasons including ridding tumours benign malignant complete hysterectomy involves removal body fundus cervix uterus partial hysterectomy involve removal uterine body leaving cervix intact commonly performed gynecological surgical procedure
pathological states include

prolapse uterus
carcinoma cervix malignant neoplasm

fibroids benign neoplasms
adenomyosis ectopic growth endometrial tissue within myometrium
endometritis infection uterine cavity
pyometra infection uterus commonly seen dogs
uterine malformations mainly congenital malformations including uterine didelphys bicornuate uterus septate uterus also includes congenital absence uterus rokitansky syndrome
ashermans syndrome also known intrauterine adhesions occurs basal layer endometrium damaged instrumentation infection endometrial tuberculosis resulting endometrial scarring followed adhesion formation partially completely obliterates uterine cavity
hematometra accumulation blood within uterus





transvaginal ultrasonography showing uterine fluid accumulation postmenopausal woman



accumulation fluids blood unknown constitution study came conclusion postmenopausal women endometrial fluid collection gynecologic ultrasonography undergo endometrial biopsy endometrial lining thicker endometrial fluid echogenic cases lining less clear endometrial fluid endometrial biopsy regarded necessary endocervical curettage rule endocervical cancer recommended18

animalsedit
animals eggs birds reptiles including ovoviviparous species oviduct instead uterus however recent research biology viviparous merely ovoviviparous skink trachylepis ivensi revealed development close analogue eutherian mammalian placental development20
monotremes mammals eggs namely platypus echidnas either term uterus oviduct used describe organ develop placenta within mother thus receive nourishment formation fertilization
marsupials uteri connect lateral vagina third middle vagina functions birth canal21 marsupial embryos form choriovitelline placenta thought something monotreme true placenta eggs yolk supplies large part embryos nutrition also attaches uterine wall takes nutrients mothers bloodstream however bandicoots also rudimentary chorioallantoic placenta similar placental mammals

fetus usually develops fully placental mammals partially marsupials including kangaroos opossums marsupials uterus forms duplex organ uteri monotremes egglaying mammals platypus uterus duplex rather nurturing embryo secretes shell around essentially identical shell gland birds reptiles uterus homologous22
mammals four main forms uterus duplex bipartite bicornuate simplex23

duplex
wholly separate uteri fallopian tube found marsupials kangaroos tasmanian devils opossums rodents mice rats guinea pigs lagomorpha rabbits hares
bipartite
uteri separate length share single cervix found ruminants deer moose hyraxes cats horses
bicornuate
upper parts uterus remain separate lower parts fused single structure found dogs pigs elephants whales dolphins tarsiers strepsirrhine primates among others
simplex
entire uterus fused single organ found higher primates including humans chimpanzees occasionally individual females including humans bicornuate uterus uterine malformation parts uterus fail fuse completely fetal development

uteri usually form initially female usually male fetus placental mammals partially completely fuse single uterus depending species many species uteri functional humans higher primates chimpanzees usually single completely fused uterus although individuals uteri completely fused
