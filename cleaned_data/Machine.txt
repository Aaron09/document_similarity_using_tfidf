etymology
english word machine comes middle french latin machina2 turn derives greek doric μαχανά makhana ionic μηχανή mekhane contrivance machine engine3 derivation μῆχος mekhos means expedient remedy4 word mechanical comes greek roots however ancient greeks probably borrowed word mekhane ancient hebrews word mekhonot plural mekhona singular mentioned hebrew bible torah mekhonot contraption four wheels stood holy temple jerusalem built king solomon chronicles ancient greeks familiar hebrew scriptures language often borrowed words terms
wider meaning fabric structure found classical latin greek usage meaning found late medieval french adopted french english mid16th century
17th century word could also mean scheme plot meaning expressed derived machination modern meaning develops specialized application term stage engines used theater military siege engines late 16th early 17th centuries traces formal modern meaning john harris lexicon technicum 1704

machine engine mechanicks whatsoever hath force sufficient either raise stop motion body simple machines commonly reckoned number ballance leaver pulley wheel wedge screw compound machines engines innumerable

word engine used nearsynonym harris later language derives ultimately french latin ingenium ingenuity invention
