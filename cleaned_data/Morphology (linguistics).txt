inflection word formationedit
given notion lexeme possible distinguish kinds morphological rules morphological rules relate different forms lexeme rules relate different lexemes rules first kind inflectional rules second kind rules word formation generation english plural dogs inflectional rule compound phrases words like catcher dishwasher examples word formation informally word formation rules form words accurately lexemes inflection rules yield variant forms word lexeme
distinction inflection word formation clear many examples linguists fail agree whether given rule inflection word formation next section attempt clarify distinction
word formation process combines complete words whereas inflection combine suffix verb change form subject sentence example present indefinite ‘go’ subject iweyouthey plural nouns whereas third person singular pronouns hesheit singular nouns ‘goes’ ‘es’ inflectional marker used match subject difference word formation resultant word differ source word’s grammatical category whereas process inflection word never changes grammatical category

linguistic paradigm complete related word forms associated given lexeme familiar examples paradigms conjugations verbs declensions nouns also arranging word forms lexeme tables classifying according shared inflectional categories tense aspect mood number gender case organizes example personal pronouns english organized tables using categories person first second third number singular plural gender masculine feminine neuter case nominative oblique genitive
inflectional categories used group word forms paradigms cannot chosen arbitrarily must categories relevant stating syntactic rules language person number categories used define paradigms english english grammatical agreement rules require verb sentence appear inflectional form matches person number subject therefore syntactic rules english care difference dogs choice forms determines form verb used however syntactic rule difference catcher dependent independent first nouns second adjectives
important difference inflection word formation inflected word forms lexemes organized paradigms defined requirements syntactic rules corresponding syntactic rules word formation relationship syntax morphology called morphosyntax concerns inflection paradigms word formation compounding
allomorphyedit
morphological rules described analogies word forms dogs cats dish dishes case analogy applies form words meaning pair first word means second difference always plural form affixed second word signaling distinction singular plural entities
largest sources complexity morphology onetoone correspondence meaning form scarcely applies every case language english word form pairs like oxoxen goosegeese sheepsheep difference singular plural signaled departs regular pattern signaled even cases regarded regular simple dogs pronounced cats plurals dishes vowel added cases distinction effected alternative forms word constitute allomorphy
phonological rules constrain sounds appear next language morphological rules applied blindly would often violate phonological rules resulting sound sequences prohibited language question example form plural dish simply appending word would result form dɪʃs permitted phonotactics english order rescue word vowel sound inserted root plural marker dɪʃɪz results similar rules apply pronunciation dogs cats depends quality voiced unvoiced final preceding phoneme

morphemebased morphology tree word independently


morphemebased morphology word forms analyzed arrangements morphemes morpheme defined minimal meaningful unit language word independently morphemes said depend depend root morphemes case derivational affixes14 words dogs root inflectional morpheme simplest naïve form analyzing word forms called itemandarrangement treats words made morphemes concatenated like beads string recent sophisticated approaches distributed morphology seek maintain idea morpheme accommodating nonconcatenated analogical processes proven problematic itemandarrangement theories similar approaches
morphemebased morphology presumes three basic axioms15

baudoin’s single morpheme hypothesis roots affixes status morphemes
bloomfield’s sign base morpheme hypothesis morphemes dualistic signs since phonological form meaning
bloomfield’s lexical morpheme hypothesis morphemes affixes roots alike stored lexicon

morphemebased morphology comes flavours bloomfieldian hockettian16 bloomfield morpheme minimal form meaning meaning itselfclarification needed hockett morphemes meaning elements form elements morpheme plural using allomorphs within much morphemebased morphological theory views mixed unsystematic ways writer refer morpheme plural morpheme sentence
lexemebased morphologyedit
lexemebased morphology usually takes called itemandprocess approach instead analyzing word form morphemes arranged sequence word form said result applying rules alter wordform stem order produce inflectional rule takes stem changes required rule outputs word form derivational rule takes stem changes requirements outputs derived stem compounding rule takes word forms similarly outputs compound stem
wordbased morphologyedit
wordbased morphology usually wordandparadigm approach theory takes paradigms central notion instead stating rules combine morphemes word forms generate word forms stems wordbased morphology states generalizations hold forms inflectional paradigms major point behind approach many generalizations hard state either approaches examples usually drawn fusional languages given piece word morphemebased theory would call inflectional morpheme corresponds combination grammatical categories example thirdperson plural morphemebased theories usually problems situation since says given morpheme categories itemandprocess theories hand often break cases like often assume separate rules third person plural distinction turns artificial approaches treat whole words related analogical rules words categorized based pattern applies existing words ones application pattern different used historically give rise word older replacing elder older follows normal pattern adjectival superlatives cows replacing kine cows fits regular pattern plural formation
morphological typologyedit
main article morphological typology
19th century philologists devised classic classification languages according morphology languages isolating little morphology others agglutinative whose words tend lots easily separable morphemes others inflectional fusional inflectional morphemes fused together leads bound morpheme conveying multiple pieces information standard example isolating language chinese agglutinative language turkish latin greek prototypical inflectional fusional languages
clear classification clearcut many languages latin greek among neatly types continuum complex morphology language adopted
three models morphology stem attempts analyze languages less match different categories typology itemandarrangement approach fits naturally agglutinative languages itemandprocess wordandparadigm approaches usually address fusional languages
little fusion involved word formation classical typology mostly applies inflectional morphology depending preferred expressing noninflectional notions languages classified synthetic using word formation analytic using syntactic phrases
examplesedit
pingelapese micronesian language spoken pingelap atoll eastern caroline islands called high island pohnpei similar languages words pingelapese take different forms even change meaning verbal suffixes morphemes added word change form prefixes added front example pingelapese suffix –kin means ‘with’ added verb
iuskin
mwahu good mwahukin good
example verbal prefix added beginning word means ‘not’
pwung correct sapwung incorrect
also directional suffixes added root word gives listener better idea subject headed verb means walk directional suffix used give detail
‘up’ aluhda walk
‘down’ aluhdi walk
‘away speaker listener’ aluheng walk away
