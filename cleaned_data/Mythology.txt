plato famously condemned poetic myth discussing education republic critique primarily grounds uneducated might take stories gods heroes literally nevertheless constantly referred myths throughout writings platonism developed phases commonly called middle platonism neoplatonism writers plutarch porphyry proclus olympiodorus damascius wrote explicitly symbolic interpretation traditional orphic myths73
