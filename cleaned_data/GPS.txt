augmentationedit
integrating external information calculation process materially improve accuracy augmentation systems generally named described based information arrives systems transmit additional error information clock drift ephemera ionospheric delay others characterize prior errors third group provides additional navigational vehicle information
examples augmentation systems include wide area augmentation system waas european geostationary navigation overlay service egnos differential dgps inertial navigation systems assisted standard accuracy meters feet augmented meters 98–164 dgps meters feet waas129
precise monitoringedit
accuracy improved precise monitoring measurement existing signals additional alternate ways
largest remaining error usually unpredictable delay ionosphere spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters errors remain reason spacecraft transmit least frequencies ionospheric delay welldefined function frequency total electron content along path measuring arrival time difference frequencies determines thus precise ionospheric delay frequency
military receivers decode code transmitted without decryption keys still possible codeless technique compare codes gain much error information however technique slow currently available specialized surveying equipment future additional civilian codes expected transmitted frequencies modernization users able perform dualfrequency measurements directly compute ionospheric delay errors
second form precise monitoring called carrierphase enhancement cpgps corrects error arises pulse transition instantaneous thus correlation satellite–receiver sequence matching operation imperfect cpgps uses carrier wave period

additional clock signal resolve uncertainty phase difference error normal amounts meters 7–10 ambiguity cpgps working within perfect transition reduces error centimeters ambiguity eliminating error source cpgps coupled dgps normally realizes 20–30 centimeters 8–12 absolute accuracy
relative kinematic positioning third alternative precise gpsbased positioning system approach determination range signal resolved precision less centimeters done resolving number cycles signal transmitted received receiver using combination differential dgps correction data transmitting signal phase information ambiguity resolution techniques statistical tests—possibly processing realtime realtime kinematic positioning
timekeeping edit
leap secondsedit
clocks derive time coordinated universal time atomic clocks satellites time gpst page united states naval observatory difference time corrected match rotation earth contain leap seconds corrections periodically added time match 1980 since diverged lack corrections means time remains constant offset international atomic time seconds periodic corrections performed onboard clocks keep synchronized ground clocks130
navigation message includes difference time january 2017 time seconds ahead leap second added december 2016131 receivers subtract offset time calculate specific timezone values units show correct time receiving offset message gpsutc offset field accommodate leap seconds eight bits
accuracyedit
time theoretically accurate nanosecondsper relative what132 however receivers lose accuracy interpretation signals accurate nanoseconds133134
formatedit

carrier phase tracking surveyingedit
another method used surveying applications carrier phase tracking period carrier frequency multiplied speed light gives wavelength meters carrier accuracy within wavelength detecting leading edge reduces component pseudorange error little millimeters compares meters code meters code
however millimeter accuracy requires measuring total phase—the number waves multiplied wavelength plus fractional wavelength requires specially equipped receivers method many surveying applications accurate enough realtime tracking slow motions tectonic plates typically 0–100 inches year
triple differencing followed numerical root finding mathematical technique called least squares estimate position receiver given position another first compute difference satellites receivers finally epochs orders taking differences equally valid detailed discussion errors omitted
