skillsedit








player attacking mode bottom player tries block opponents attack


several basic skills competitive players need master serving passing setting attacking blocking digging
serving putting ball play striking hand behind rear court boundary serving take form underhand serve overhand serve jump serve underhand overhand serves similar beach indoors exception beach wind often significant effect trajectory ball although serve used offensive weapon rallies receiving team first attack opportunity
pass first teams allowed contacts also similar beach indoors however standards hand setting handling ball overhand using finger action hands separated stricter beach practice means players effectively forbidden setting ball serve receive similarly players seldom hand setting motion first except hard driven attack last three allowed team contacts digging similar skill passing term used describe receiving serve free ball rather refers attempt prevent opponents attack touching court
second team contact purpose position ball attack third hand setting motion often used bump setting underhand motion ball bounces forearms also common using hand motion contact setting players hands must contact ball simultaneously referee determines doublehit occurred point given team excessive spin ball often used indicator double contact fault causing ball spin setting explicitly prohibited completing contact setter typically turns attention defense communicates partner whether blocker area court open second contact also used attack ball
attacking includes skills spiking—hitting ball hard open hand downward trajectory rolling—a similar motion spiking softer arcing trajectory dinking—directing ball softly attack hits also frequently made poking motion knuckles stiff straight fingers
blocking attempt direct attack opponents back court reaching players often decide blocking pass good position produce spike attack instead peel peeling action skill almost exclusive beach volleyball
participantsedit
team composed exclusively players must always play cannot subjected substitutions replacement moment ball server team must within court exception server determined positions court positional faults committed players switch point game position must stay like indoor
player specializationedit
positions competitive players generally specialized defensive roles141516

blocker blockers task take away part court line angle block14 height advantage blocking1516
defender defenders responsibility position oneself area covered block harddriven spike chase soft shot14 agility speed digging skills important factors defense1516

competitive teams specializations players taking turns blocking playing defense allows conserve energy since demand energy sand higher16
competitive players also tend specialize playing either right leftside court allows greater consistency receiving serve shot selection lefthanded players generally prefer play rightside righthanded players generally prefer play leftside easier spike ball passed across line ones body17
scoring systemedit
first sets wins match first team reach points points deciding final twopoint advantage thus score 21–20 15–14 final continues
whenever team fails execute legal service return ball commits fault opposing team wins rally scores point serves start following rally
teams switch ends court every points points played total points adding score teams technical time
characteristics hitedit
ball touch part body except serve hand make contact must caught thrown player make contact ball time
receiving ball hard driven ball must contacted cleanly—if player receives ball openhanded contact hand ball must exactly simultaneous practice means serves never received openhanded receiving opponents harddriven attack double contact provided contacts occur single action andor slight lift ball allowed particular defensive action hard driven ball ball held momentarily overhand fingers
employing overhand pass hands separated ball handled fingers second three team touches usually intent setting ball player make effective attackhit standard double contact fault lenient receiving attacking though still much stricter indoor volleyball standard lift fault overhand pass less strict indoor games—it legal allow ball come rest small period time
attackhits using openhanded dink directing ball fingers illegal attackhits using overhand pass direct ball trajectory perpendicular line shoulders overhand passes accidentally cross exception differences rules indoor volleyball beach volleyball strongly affect tactics techniques
block signalsedit
beach volleyball players hand signals indicate type block intend make block signals made behind back hide opposing team usually given hands serving players partner prior serve hand referring type block attack corresponding opponent player also wiggle flash block signal indicate opponent serve
server designated blocker block serving otherwise signaling player perform block
