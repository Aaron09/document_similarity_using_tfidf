family namesedit




lineage family c1809


family names simultaneously important pieces genealogical information source significant confusion researchers37
many cultures name person refers family belongs called family name surname last name patronymics names identify individual based fathers name example marga olafsdottir marga daughter olaf olaf thorsson olaf thor many cultures used patronymics surnames adopted came dutch york example used patronymic system names 1687 advent english rule mandated surname usage38 iceland patronymics used majority population39 denmark norway patronymics farm names generally 19th century beyond though surnames began come fashion toward 19th century parts country 1856 denmark40 1923 norway41 laws requiring surnames
transmission names across generations marriages relationships immigration cause difficulty genealogical research instance women many cultures routinely used spouses surnames woman remarried changed name names children name changed names birth name maiden name reflected childrens middle names middle name dropped entirely42 children sometimes assume stepparent foster parent adoptive parent names official records reflect many kinds surname change without explaining underlying reason change correct identification person recorded identified name challenging immigrants america often americanized names43
surname data found trade directories census returns birth death marriage records
given namesedit

genealogical data regarding given names first names subject many problems family names place names additionally nicknames common example beth lizzie betty common elizabeth jack john jonathan interchanged
middle names provide additional information middle names inherited follow naming customs treated part family name instance latin cultures mothers family name fathers family name used children
historically naming traditions existed places cultures even areas tended naming conventions however means universal families used time among children pattern might also broken name newborn recently deceased sibling aunt uncle
example naming tradition england scotland ireland

paternal grandfather

another example areas germany siblings given first name often favourite saint local nobility different second names known rufname child died next child gender born given name uncommon list particular couples children show names repeated
personal names periods popularity uncommon find many similarly named people generation even similarly named families william mary children david mary john
many names identified strongly particular gender william boys mary girls others ambiguous slightly variant spellings based gender frances usually female francis usually male
place namesedit
locations ancestors residences life events core elements genealogists quest often confusing place names subject variant spellings partially literate scribes locations identical similar names example village name brockton occurs times border area english counties shropshire staffordshire shifts political borders must also understood parish county national borders frequently modified records contain references farms villages ceased exist working older records poland borders place names changed frequently past centuries source maps sample records translation guide 19thcentury polishlanguage civilregistration documents invaluable
available sources include vital records civil church registration censuses assessments oral tradition also important source although must used caution source information available location circumstantial evidence provide probable answer based persons familys place residence time event
maps gazetteers important sources understanding places researched show relationship area neighboring communities help understanding migration patterns family tree mapping using online mapping tools google earth particularly used historical overlays david rumsey historical collection assist process understanding significance geographical locations
datesedit
wise exercise extreme caution dates dates difficult recall years event easily mistranscribed types genealogical data44 therefore determine whether date recorded time event later date dates birth vital records civil registrations church records baptism generally accurate usually recorded near time event family bibles often source dates written memory long event handwriting used entries dates probably written time therefore less reliable since earlier dates probably recorded well event publication date bible also provides clue dates recorded since could recorded earlier date
people sometimes reduce marriage full increase order marry join armed forces census returns notoriously unreliable ages assuming approximate death date ages 1841 census rounded next lower multiple five years
although baptismal dates often used approximate birth dates families waited years baptizing children adult baptisms norm religions birth marriage dates adjusted cover prewedding pregnancies
calendar changes must also considered 1752 england american colonies changed julian gregorian calendar year date year began changed prior 1752 march changed january many european countries already made calendar changes england sometimes centuries earlier 1751 11day discrepancy date england date european countries
detail changes involved moving julian gregorian calendar gregorian calendar
french republican calendar french revolutionary calendar calendar proposed french revolution used french government years late 1793 1805 days 1871 paris dates official records time revolutionary calendar need translating gregorian calendar calculating ages various websites this45
occupationsedit
occupational information important understanding ancestors life distinguishing people name persons occupation related social status political interest migration pattern since skilled trades often passed father occupation also indirect evidence family relationship
important remember person change occupations titles change time well workers longer primary trade often took less prestigious jobs later life others moved upwards prestige46 many unskilled ancestors variety jobs depending season local trade requirements census returns contain embellishment labourer mason journeyman master craftsman names unfamiliar local occupations cause confusion poorly legible example ostler keeper horses hostler innkeeper could easily confused another likewise descriptions occupations also problematic perplexing description ironer rabbit burrows turn describe ironer profession bristol district named rabbit burrows several trades regionally preferred terms example shoemaker cordwainer meaning finally many apparently obscure jobs part larger trade community watchmaking framework knitting gunmaking
occupational data reported occupational licenses assessments membership records professional organizations trade directories census returns vital records civil registration occupational dictionaries available explain many obscure archaic trades47
reliability sourcesedit
information found historical genealogical sources unreliable good practice evaluate sources critical factors influencing reliability genealogical information include knowledge informant writer bias mental state informant writer passage time potential copying compiling errors
quality census data special interest historians investigated reliability issues4448
knowledge informantedit
informant individual provided recorded information genealogists must carefully consider provided information knew many cases informant identified record example death certificate usually informants physician provides information time cause death family member provides birth date names parents
informant identified sometimes deduce information identity person careful examination source first consider alive nearby record created informant also person recording information handwriting compared handwriting samples
source provide clues informant genealogists treat source caution sources useful compared independent sources example census record cannot given much weight informant unknown however censuses several years concur piece information would likely guessed neighbor likely information censuses provided family member informed person hand information single census cannot confirmed information undocumented compiled genealogy since genealogy used census record source might therefore dependent misinformed individual
motivation informantedit
even individuals knowledge fact sometimes intentionally unintentionally provided false misleading information person lied order obtain government benefit military pension avoid taxation cover embarrassing situation existence nonmarital child person distressed state mind able accurately recall information many genealogical records recorded time loved ones death genealogists consider effect grief informant records
effect timeedit
passage time often affects persons ability recall information therefore general rule data recorded soon event usually reliable data recorded many years later however types data difficult recall many years others type especially prone recollection errors dates also ability recall affected significance event individual values affected cultural individual preferences
copying compiling errorsedit
genealogists must consider effects copying compiling errors information source reason sources generally categorized categories original derivative original source based another source derivative source information taken another source distinction important time source copied information record lost errors result copyist misreading mistyping miswriting information genealogists consider number times information copied types derivation piece information undergone types derivatives include photocopies transcriptions abstracts translations extractions compilations
addition copying errors compiled sources published genealogies online pedigree databases susceptible misidentification errors incorrect conclusions based circumstantial evidence identity errors usually occur individuals assumed person circumstantial indirect evidence explicitly answer genealogical question either used sources answer question suggest probable answer eliminate certain possibilities compilers sometimes draw hasty conclusions circumstantial evidence without sufficiently examining available sources without properly understanding evidence without appropriately indicating level uncertainty
primary secondary sourcesedit
genealogical research information obtained primary secondary sources primary sources records made time event example death certificate would primary source persons death date place secondary sources records made days weeks months even years event
