sawmill processedit
sawmills basic operation much like hundreds years enters dimensional lumber exits

trees selected harvest next step logging felling trees bucking length
branches trunk known limbing
logs taken logging truck rail drive sawmill
logs scaled either mill upon arrival mill
debarking removes bark logs
decking process sorting logs species size lumber plywood chips
sawyer uses head also called head primary break cants unfinished logs processed flitches unfinished planks
depending upon species quality cants either broken resaw gang edger multiple flitches andor boards
edging take flitch trim irregular edges leaving foursided lumber
trimming squares ends typical lumber lengths
drying removes naturally occurring moisture lumber done kilns airdried
planing smooths surface lumber leaving uniform width thickness
shipping transports finished lumber market1

hierapolis sawmill waterpowered stone mill hierapolis asia minor modernday turkey part roman empire dating second half century earliest known sawmill also incorporates crank connecting mechanism2
waterpowered stone sawmills working cranks connecting rods without gear train archaeologically attested century byzantine cities gerasa asia minor ephesus syria3
earliest literary reference working sawmill comes roman poet ausonius wrote epic poem river moselle germany late century point poem describes shrieking sound watermill cutting marble4 marble sawmills also seem indicated christian saint gregory nyssa anatolia around 370390 demonstrating diversified waterpower many parts roman empire4
11th century hydropowered sawmills widespread medieval islamic world islamic spain north africa west central asia east5
sawmills later became widespread medieval europe sketched villard honnecourt 12506 claimed introduced madeira following discovery 1420 spread widely europe 16th century7
prior invention sawmill boards rived split planed often sawn whipsaw using saddleblocks hold pitman worked sawing slow required strong hearty topsawer stronger pulled turn lower advantage gravity topsawyer also guide board even thickness often done following chalkline
early sawmills simply adapted whipsaw mechanical power generally driven water wheel speed process circular motion wheel changed backandforth motion blade connecting known pitman thus introducing term used many mechanical applications
generally powered logs loaded moved hand early improvement development movable carriage also water powered move steadily blade
type sawmill without crank known germany called knock drop simply drop mills drop sawmills frame carrying blade knocked upwards cams shaft turns cams shaft waterwheel sits frame carrying blade topmost position drops weight making loud knocking noise cuts trunk8
small mill would center many rural communities woodexporting regions baltic countries canada output mills would quite perhaps boards would also generally operate winter peak logging season
united states sawmill introduced soon colonisation virginia recruiting skilled hamburg later metal parts obtained netherlands9 technology ahead england sawmill remained largely unknown late 18th century arrival sawmill large stimulative step growth frontier community
industrial revolutionedit
early mills taken forest temporary shelter built logs skidded nearby mill horse teams often snow provide lubrication mills grew larger usually established permanent facilities river logs floated drivers sawmills built navigable rivers lakes estuaries called cargo mills availability ships transporting cargoes logs sawmill cargoes lumber sawmill10
next improvement circular blades perhaps invented england late 18th century perhaps 17thcentury holland netherlands soon thereafter millers used gangsaws added additional blades would reduced boards quick step circular blades extremely expensive highly subject damage overheating dirty logs kind technician arose sawfiler sawfilers highly skilled metalworking main sharpen teeth craft also involved learning hammer whereby deformed hammer anvil counteract forces heat cutting modern circular blades replaceable teeth still need hammered11
introduction steam power 19th century created many possibilities mills availability railroad transportation logs lumber encouraged building rail mills away navigable water steam powered sawmills could mechanized scrap lumber mill provided ready fuel source firing boiler efficiency increased capital cost mill increased dramatically well10
addition steam gasolinepowered traction engines also allowed entire sawmill mobile1213
1900 largest sawmill world operated atlantic lumber company georgetown south carolina using logs floated river edge appalachian mountains north carolina
restoration project sturgeons mill northern california underway restoring last steampowered lumber mills still using original equipment
current trendsedit




oregon mill using energy efficient ponding move logs


twentieth century introduction electricity high technology furthered process sawmills massive expensive facilities aspects work computerized cost facility mmfbmday capacity can120000000 modern operation produce mmfbm mmfbm annually
small gasolinepowered sawmills local entrepreneurs served many communities early twentieth century specialty markets still today
trend small portable sawmill personal even professional many different models emerged different designs functions especially suitable producing limited volumes boards specialty milling oversized timber portable sawmills gained popularity convenience bringing sawmill logs milling lumber remote locations14 remote communities experienced natural disasters used portable sawmills rebuild communities fallen trees
technology changed sawmill operations significantly recent years emphasizing increasing profits waste minimization increased energy efficiency well improving operator safety onceubiquitous rusty steel conical sawdust burners part vanished sawdust mill waste processed particleboard related products used heat wooddrying kilns cogeneration facilities produce power operation also feed superfluous energy onto grid bark ground landscaping barkdust also burned heat sawdust make particle board pressed wood pellets pellet stoves larger pieces wood wont make lumber chipped wood chips provide source supply paper mills wood byproducts mills also make oriented strand board paneling building construction cheaper alternative plywood paneling automatic mills process small logs bark chips wood chips sawdust sorted stacked bound planks hour
