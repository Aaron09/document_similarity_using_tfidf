alkyl chain variations alcohols
shortchain alcohols alkyl chains carbons mediumchain alcohols alkyl chains carbons longchain alcohols also known fatty alcohols alkyl chains 8–21 carbons longchain alcohols alkyl chains carbons longer16
simple alcohols
simple alcohols appears completely undefined term however simple alcohols often referred common names derived adding word alcohol name appropriate alkyl group instance chain consisting carbon methyl group group attached carbon called methyl alcohol chain carbons ethyl group ch2ch3 group connected called ethyl alcohol complex alcohols iupac nomenclature must used17
simple alcohols particular ethanol methanol possess denaturing inert rendering properties leading antimicrobial agents medicine pharmacy industrycitation needed
higher alcohols
encyclopædia britannica states higher alcohols—those containing carbon atoms—are somewhat viscous oily heavier fruity odours highly branched alcohols many alcohols containing carbon atoms solids room temperature18
like ethanol butanol produced fermentation processes saccharomyces yeast known produce higher alcohols temperatures bacterium clostridium acetobutylicum feed cellulose produce butanol industrial scale19
applications




total recorded alcohol capita consumption litres pure ethanol20


alcohol long history several uses worldwide found alcoholic beverages sold adults fuel also many scientific medical industrial uses term alcoholfree often used describe product contain alcohol

alcoholic beverages typically containing 3–40 alcohol volume produced consumed humans since prehistoric times natural fermentation also produces trace amounts alcohols 2methyl2butanol γhydroxybutyric acid psychoactive effects similar alcohol used drug
antifreeze commonly includes volume solution ethylene glycol water
medical ethanol used antiseptic disinfect skin injections given often along iodine21 ethanolbased soaps becoming common restaurants convenient require drying volatility compound alcohol based gels become common hand sanitizerscitation needed
alcohol fuel alcohols mainly ethanol methanol used fuel fuel performance increased forced induction internal combustion engines injecting alcohol intake turbocharger supercharger pressurized cools pressurized providing denser charge allows fuel therefore powercitation needed
preservative alcohol often used preservative biological specimens fields science medicine
solvent hydroxyl groups found alcohols polar therefore hydrophilic water loving carbon chain portion nonpolar make hydrophobic molecule increasingly becomes overall nonpolar therefore less soluble polar water carbon chain becomes longer22 methanol shortest carbon chain alcohols carbon atom followed ethanol carbon atoms alcohols applications industry science reagents solvents relatively toxicity compared alcohols ability dissolve nonpolar substances ethanol used solvent medical drugs perfumes vegetable essences vanilla organic synthesis alcohols serve versatile intermediatescitation needed

ethanols toxicity largely caused primary metabolite acetaldehyde systematically ethanal2728 secondary metabolite acetic acid28293031 many primary alcohols metabolized aldehydes carboxylic acids whose toxicities similar acetaldehyde acetic acidcitation needed metabolite toxicity reduced rats nacetylcysteine2732 thiamine33
although mechanism unclear metaanalysis studies shown increased cancer risk consumption ethanol3435
tertiary alcohols cannot metabolized aldehydes36 result cause hangover toxicity mechanism
secondary tertiary alcohols less poisonous ethanol liver unable metabolize toxic byproducts37 makes suitable pharmaceutical chronic harms lower38 ethchlorvynol tertamyl alcohol tertiary alcohols seen medicinal recreational use39

treatment
effective treatment prevent toxicity methanol ethylene glycol ingestion administer ethanol alcohol dehydrogenase higher affinity ethanol thus preventing methanol binding acting substrate remaining methanol time excreted kidneys404647
physical chemical properties
alcohols odor often described biting hanging nasal passages ethanol slightly sweeter fruitlike odor alcohols
general hydroxyl group makes alcohol molecule polar groups form hydrogen bonds another compounds except certain large molecules hydroxyl protected steric hindrance adjacent groups48 hydrogen bonding means alcohols used protic solvents opposing solubility trends alcohols tendency polar promote solubility water tendency carbon chain resist thus methanol ethanol propanol miscible water hydroxyl group wins short carbon chain butanol fourcarbon chain moderately soluble balance trends alcohols five carbons pentanol higher effectively insoluble water hydrocarbon chains dominance simple alcohols miscible organic solventscitation needed
hydrogen bonding alcohols tend higher boiling points comparable hydrocarbons ethers boiling point alcohol ethanol 7829 compared hydrocarbon hexane common constituent gasoline diethyl ether
alcohols like water show either acidic basic properties group around 1619 general slightly weaker acids water still able react strong bases sodium hydride reactive metals sodium salts result called alkoxides general formula
meanwhile oxygen atom lone pairs nonbonded electrons render weakly basic presence strong acids sulfuric acid example methanol
