larva papilio xuthus butterfly


larva plural larvae ˈlɑːrviː distinct juvenile form many animals undergo metamorphosis adults animals indirect development insects amphibians cnidarians typically larval phase life cycle
larvas appearance generally different adult form caterpillars butterflies larva often unique structures organs occur adult form diet also considerably different
larvae frequently adapted environments separate adults example larvae tadpoles live almost exclusively aquatic environments live outside water adult frogs living distinct environment larvae given shelter predators reduce competition resources adult population
animals larval stage consume food fuel transition adult form species like barnacles adults immobile larvae mobile mobile larval form distribute
larvae dependent adults feed many eusocial hymenoptera species larvae female workers ropalidia marginata paper wasp males also capable feeding larvae much less efficient spending time getting less food larvae1
larvae species example newts become pubescent develop adult form type neoteny




eurosta solidaginis goldenrod gall larva


misunderstanding larval form always reflects groups evolutionary history could case often larval stage evolved secondarily insects cases larval form differ adult form groups common origincitation needed

insect larvaedit
within insects endopterygotes show different types larvae3 several classifications suggested many entomologists4 following classification based antonio berlese classification 1913 four main types endopterygote larvae types5

apodous larvae legs poorly sclerotized based sclerotization three apodous forms recognized

eucephalous well sclerotized head capsule found nematocera buprestidae cerambycidae families
hemicephalus reduced head capsule retractable thorax found tipulidae brachycera families
acephalus without head capsule found cyclorrhapha


protopod larvae larva many different forms often unlike normal insect form hatch eggs contains little yolk first instar larvae parasitic hymenoptera
polypod larvae also known eruciform larvae larva abdominal prolegs addition usual thoracic legs poorly sclerotized relatively inactive live close contact food best example caterpillars lepidopterans
oligopod larvae well developed head capsule mouthparts similar adult without compound eyes legs abdominal prolegs types seen

campodeiform well sclerotized dorsoventrally flattened body usually long legged predators prognathos mouthparts lacewing trichopterans mayflies coleopterans
scarabeiform poorly sclerotized flat thorax abdomen usually short legged inactive burrowing forms scarabaeoidea coleopterans
