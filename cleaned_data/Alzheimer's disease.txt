disease course divided four stages progressive pattern cognitive functional impairment
predementia
first symptoms often mistakenly attributed ageing stress22 detailed neuropsychological testing reveal mild cognitive difficulties eight years person fulfils clinical criteria diagnosis ad23 early symptoms affect complex activities daily living24 noticeable deficit short term memory loss shows difficulty remembering recently learned facts inability acquire information2325
subtle problems executive functions attentiveness planning flexibility abstract thinking impairments semantic memory memory meanings concept relationships also symptomatic early stages ad23 apathy observed stage remains persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout course disease26 depressive symptoms irritability reduced awareness subtle memory difficulties also common27 preclinical stage disease also termed mild cognitive impairment mci25 often found transitional stage normal ageing dementia present variety symptoms memory loss predominant symptom termed amnestic frequently seen prodromal stage alzheimers disease28
early
people increasing impairment learning memory eventually leads definitive diagnosis small percentage difficulties language executive functions perception agnosia execution movements apraxia prominent memory problems29 affect memory capacities equally older memories persons life episodic memory facts learned semantic memory implicit memory memory body things using fork drink glass affected lesser degree facts memories3031
language problems mainly characterised shrinking vocabulary decreased word fluency leading general impoverishment oral written language2932 stage person alzheimers usually capable communicating basic ideas adequately293233 performing fine motor tasks writing drawing dressing certain movement coordination planning difficulties apraxia present commonly unnoticed29 disease progresses people often continue perform many tasks independently need assistance supervision cognitively demanding activities29
moderate

progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence subjects unable perform common activities daily living29 speech difficulties become evident inability recall vocabulary leads frequent incorrect word substitutions paraphasias reading writing skills also progressively lost2933 complex motor sequences become less coordinated time passes progresses risk falling increases29 phase memory problems worsen person fail recognise close relatives29 longterm memory previously intact becomes impaired29
behavioural neuropsychiatric changes become prevalent common manifestations wandering irritability labile affect leading crying outbursts unpremeditated aggression resistance caregiving29 sundowning also appear34 approximately people develop illusionary misidentifications delusional symptoms29 subjects also lose insight disease process limitations anosognosia29 urinary incontinence develop29 symptoms create stress relatives carers reduced moving person home care longterm care facilities2935
advanced
final stages patient completely dependent upon caregivers29 language reduced simple phrases even single words eventually leading complete loss speech2933 despite loss verbal language abilities people often understand return emotional signals although aggressiveness still present extreme apathy exhaustion much common symptoms people alzheimers disease ultimately able perform even simplest tasks independently muscle mass mobility deteriorates point bedridden unable feed cause death usually external factor infection pressure ulcers pneumonia disease itself29
cause
cause alzheimers cases still mostly unknown except cases genetic differences identified3637 several competing hypotheses exist trying explain cause disease
genetic
