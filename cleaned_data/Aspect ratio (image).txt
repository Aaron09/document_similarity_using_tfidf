aspect ratio image describes proportional relationship width height commonly expressed numbers separated colon aspect ratio matter small image width divided units equal length height measured using length unit height measured units
example group images aspect ratio image might inches wide inches high another centimeters wide centimeters high third might yards wide yards high thus aspect ratio concerns relationship width height images actual size
