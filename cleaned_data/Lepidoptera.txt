lepidopteran species characterized three derived features apparent scales covering bodies wings proboscis scales modified flattened hairs give butterflies moths extraordinary variety colors patterns almost species form membranous wings except reduced wings wingless like insects butterflies moths holometabolous meaning undergo complete metamorphosis mating laying eggs carried adults normally near host plants larvae larvae commonly called caterpillars completely different adult moth butterfly forms cylindrical body welldeveloped head mandible mouth parts three pairs thoracic legs none five pairs prolegs grow larvae change appearance going series stages called instars fully matured larva develops pupa butterflies many moth species spin silk case cocoon prior pupating others instead going underground4 butterfly pupa called chrysalis hard skin usually cocoon pupa completed metamorphosis sexually mature adult emerges
lepidoptera millions years evolved wide range wing patterns coloration ranging drab moths akin related order trichoptera brightlycolored complexpatterned butterflies1 accordingly recognized popular insect orders many people involved observation study collection rearing commerce insects person collects studies order referred lepidopterist
butterflies moths play important role natural ecosystem pollinators food food chain conversely larvae considered problematic vegetation agriculture main source food often live plant matter many species female produce eggs others number approach 30000 eggs caterpillars hatching eggs cause damage large quantities crops many moth butterfly species economic interest virtue role pollinators silk produce pest species

term coined linnaeus 1735 derived greek λεπίς λεπίδος scale πτερόν wing6 sometimes term rhopalocera used clade butterfly species derived ancient greek ῥόπαλον rhopalon74150 κέρας keras73993 meaning club horn respectively coming shape antennae butterflies
origins common names butterfly moth varied often obscure english word butterfly english buttorfleoge many variations spelling origin unknown although could derived pale yellow color many species wings suggesting color butter89 species heterocera commonly called moths origins english word moth clear deriving english moððe northumbrian dialect mohðe common germanic compare norse motti dutch german motte meaning moth perhaps origins related english maða meaning maggot root midge 16th century used mostly indicate larva usually reference devouring clothes10
