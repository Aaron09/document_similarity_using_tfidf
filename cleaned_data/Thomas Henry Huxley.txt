huxley slow accept darwins ideas gradualism undecided natural selection despite wholehearted public support darwin instrumental developing scientific education britain fought extreme versions religious tradition
originally coining term 1869 huxley elaborated agnosticism 1889 frame nature claims terms knowable huxley states

term continued present thomas henry huxley agnosticism4
huxley little formal schooling virtually selftaught became perhaps finest comparative anatomist later 19th century5 worked invertebrates clarifying relationships groups previously little understood later worked vertebrates especially relationship apes humans comparing archaeopteryx compsognathus concluded birds evolved small carnivorous dinosaurs theory widely accepted today

vertebrate palaeontologyedit
first half huxleys career palaeontologist marked rather strange predilection persistent types seemed argue evolutionary advancement sense major groups animals plants rare absent phanerozoic vein tended push origin major groups birds mammals back palaeozoic claim order plants ever gone extinctcitation needed
much paper consumed historians science ruminating strange somewhat unclear idea30 huxley wrong pitch loss orders phanerozoic estimate number orders evolved persistent types rather uncomfortably next darwins fluid ideas despite intelligence took huxley surprisingly long time appreciate implications evolution however gradually huxley moved away conservative style thinking understanding palaeontology discipline developedcitation needed

huxley originally persuaded development theory evolution called seen savage review38 robert chambers vestiges natural history creation book contained quite pertinent arguments favour evolution huxley also rejected lamarcks theory transmutation basis insufficient evidence support scepticism brought together lecture royal institution39 made darwin anxious enough effort change young huxleys mind kind thing darwin closest scientific friends must particular intuition huxley accounts impressive person even young man4041
huxley therefore small group knew darwins ideas published group included joseph dalton hooker charles lyell first publication darwin ideas came wallace sent darwin famous paper natural selection presented lyell hooker linnean society 1858 alongside excerpts darwins notebook darwin letter gray4243 huxleys famous response idea natural selection extremely stupid thought that44 however never conclusively made mind whether natural selection main method evolution though admit hypothesis good working basis

natural selectionedit
huxley certainly slavish dealings darwin shown every biography quite different rather complementary characters important also darwin field naturalist huxley anatomist difference experience nature lastly darwins views science different huxleys views darwin natural selection best explain evolution explained huge range natural history facts observations solved problems huxley hand empiricist trusted could things easily seen mind appreciate debate darwin writing letters huxley never going quite thought darwin right

huxleys courses students much narrower many bewildered contrast teaching zoology selected animal types come much criticism94 looking back 1914 time student arthur shipley said darwins later works dealt living organisms obsession dead bodies preserved refined slices95 macbride said huxley would persist looking animals material structures living active beings word necrologist96 simply huxley preferred teach actually seen eyes

huxley comfortable comparative anatomy greatest master allround naturalist like darwin shown clearly enough weave together detailed factual information subtle arguments across vast life huxley chose teaching extent research take straightforward course concentrating personal strengths
schools bibleedit
huxley also major influence direction taken british schools november 1870 voted onto london school board99 primary schooling advocated wide range disciplines similar taught today reading writing arithmetic science music secondary education recommended years basic liberal studies followed years upperdivision work focusing specific area study practical example latter famous 1868 lecture piece chalk first published essay macmillans magazine london later year100 piece reconstructs geological history britain simple piece chalk demonstrates science organized common sense

adult educationedit
huxleys interest education went still school university classrooms made great effort reach interested adults kinds largely selfeducated lecture courses working many published afterwards made journalism partly earn money mostly reach literate public adult life wrote periodicals—the westminster review saturday review reader pall mall gazette macmillans magazine contemporary review germany still ahead formal science education interested people victorian britain could initiative find going reading periodicals using lending libraries109110
