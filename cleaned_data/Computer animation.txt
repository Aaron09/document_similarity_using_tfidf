example computer animation produced motion capture technique


computer animation process used generating animated images general term computergenerated imagery encompasses static scenes dynamic images computer animation refers moving images modern computer animation usually uses computer graphics although computer graphics still used stylistic bandwidth faster realtime renderings sometimes target animation computer sometimes film well
computer animation essentially digital successor stop motion techniques using models traditional animation techniques using framebyframe animation illustrations computergenerated animations controllable physically based processes constructing miniatures effects shots hiring extras crowd scenes allows creation images would feasible using technology also allow single graphic artist produce content without actors expensive pieces props create illusion movement image displayed computer monitor repeatedly replaced image similar advanced slightly time usually rate framessecond technique identical illusion movement achieved television motion pictures
animations objects models built computer monitor modeled figures rigged virtual skeleton figure animations separate objects illustrations separate transparent layers used without virtual skeleton limbs eyes mouth clothes figure moved animator frames differences appearance frames automatically calculated computer process known tweening morphing finally animation rendered1
animations frames must rendered modeling complete vector animations rendering process frame illustration process tweened frames rendered needed prerecorded presentations rendered frames transferred different format medium like digital video frames also rendered real time presented enduser audience bandwidth animations transmitted internet adobe flash often software endusers computer render real time alternative streaming preloaded high bandwidth animations

flash animation stick figure keyframed time create motion


computer animation systems animator creates simplified representation characters anatomy analogous skeleton stick figure20 position segment skeletal model defined animation variables avars short human animal characters many parts skeletal model correspond actual bones skeletal animation also used animate things facial features though methods facial animation exist21 character woody story example uses avars face alone computer doesnt usually render skeletal model directly invisible skeletal model compute exact position orientation certain character eventually rendered image thus changing values avars time animator creates motion making character move frame frame
several methods generating avar values obtain realistic motion traditionally animators manipulate avars directly22 rather avars every frame usually avars strategic points frames time computer interpolate tween process called keyframing keyframing puts control hands animator roots handdrawn traditional animation23
contrast newer method called motion capture makes live action footage24 computer animation driven motion capture real performer acts scene character animated25 hisher motion recorded computer using video cameras markers performance applied animated character26
method advantages 2007 games films using either methods productions keyframe animation produce motions would difficult impossible motion capture reproduce subtleties particular actor27 example 2006 film pirates caribbean dead mans chest bill nighy provided performance character davy jones even though nighy doesnt appear movie movie benefited performance recording nuances body language posture facial expressions thus motion capture appropriate situations believable realistic behavior action required types characters required exceed done throughout conventional costuming
modelingedit
computer animation combines models objects programmed hand keyframed movement models constructed geometrical vertices faces edges coordinate system objects sculpted much like real clay plaster working general forms specific details various sculpting tools unless model intended solid color must painted textures realism bonejoint animation system deform model make humanoid model walk process known rigging virtual marionette given various controllers handles controlling movement28 animation data created using motion capture keyframing human animator combination two29
models rigged animation contain thousands control points example woody story uses specialized animation controllers rhythm hues studios labored years create aslan movie chronicles narnia lion witch wardrobe 1851 controllers face alone 2004 film tomorrow designers design forces extreme weather help video references accurate meteorological facts 2005 remake king kong actor andy serkis used help designers pinpoint gorillas prime location shots used expressions model human characteristics onto creature serkis earlier provided voice performance gollum tolkiens lord rings trilogy
