cartilagesedit









posterior view larynx disarticulated cartilages left intrinsic muscles right


cartilages three unpaired three paired support mammalian larynx form skeleton
unpaired cartilages

thyroid cartilage forms adams apple usually larger males females thyrohyoid membrane ligament associated thyroid cartilage connects thyroid cartilage hyoid bone
cricoid cartilage ring hyaline cartilage forms inferior wall larynx attached trachea median cricothyroid ligament connects cricoid cartilage thyroid cartilage
epiglottis large spoonshaped piece elastic cartilage swallowing pharynx larynx rise elevation pharynx widens receive food drink elevation larynx causes epiglottis move form glottis closing

paired cartilages

arytenoid cartilages paired cartilages arytenoid cartilages important influence position tension vocal folds triangular pieces mostly hyaline cartilage located posterosuperior border cricoid cartilage
corniculate cartilages hornshaped pieces elastic cartilage located apex arytenoid cartilage
cuneiform cartilages clubshaped pieces elastic cartilage located anterior corniculate cartilages

musclesedit
muscles larynx divided intrinsic extrinsic muscles
intrinsic muscles divided respiratory phonatory muscles muscles phonation respiratory muscles move vocal cords apart serve breathing phonatory muscles move vocal cords together serve production voice extrinsic passing larynx parts around intrinsic confined entirely main respiratory muscles posterior cricoarytenoid muscles phonatory muscles divided adductors lateral cricoarytenoid muscles arytenoid muscles tensors cricothyroid muscles thyroarytenoid muscles
intrinsicedit
intrinsic laryngeal muscles responsible controlling sound production

cricothyroid muscle lengthen tense vocal folds
posterior cricoarytenoid muscles abduct externally rotate arytenoid cartilages resulting abducted vocal folds
lateral cricoarytenoid muscles adduct internally rotate arytenoid cartilages increase medial compression
transverse arytenoid muscle adduct arytenoid cartilages resulting adducted vocal folds2
oblique arytenoid muscles narrow laryngeal inlet constricting distance arytenoid cartilages
thyroarytenoid muscles sphincter vestibule narrowing laryngeal inlet shortening vocal folds lowering voice pitch internal thyroarytenoid portion thyroarytenoid vibrates produce sound

notably muscle capable separating vocal cords normal breathing posterior cricoarytenoid muscle incapacitated sides inability pull vocal folds apart abduct cause difficulty breathing bilateral injury recurrent laryngeal nerve would cause condition also worth noting muscles innervated recurrent laryngeal branch vagus except cricothyroid muscle innervated external laryngeal branch superior laryngeal nerve branch vagus
additionally intrinsic laryngeal muscles present constitutive ca2buffering profile predicts better ability handle calcium changes comparison muscles3 profile agreement function fast muscles welldeveloped capacity prolonged work studies suggests mechanisms involved prompt sequestering sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2reuptake proteins plasma membrane pumps cytosolic ca2buffering proteins particularly elevated laryngeal muscles indicating importance myofiber function protection disease duchenne muscular dystrophy4 furthermore differential levels orai1 intrinsic laryngeal muscles extraocular muscles limb muscle suggests role store operated calcium entry channels muscles functional properties signaling mechanisms

functionedit
sound generationedit
sound generated larynx pitch volume manipulated strength expiration lungs also contributes loudness
manipulation larynx used generate source sound particular fundamental frequency pitch source sound altered travels vocal tract configured differently based position tongue lips mouth pharynx process altering source sound passes filter vocal tract creates many different vowel consonant sounds worlds languages well tone certain realizations stress types linguistic prosody larynx also similar function lungs creating pressure differences required sound production constricted larynx raised lowered affecting volume oral cavity necessary glottalic consonants
vocal folds held close together adducting arytenoid cartilages vibrate phonation muscles attached arytenoid cartilages control degree opening vocal fold length tension controlled rocking thyroid cartilage forward backward cricoid cartilage either directly contracting cricothyroids indirectly changing vertical position larynx manipulating tension muscles within vocal folds moving arytenoids forward backward causes pitch produced phonation rise fall males vocal folds longer greater mass females vocal folds producing lower pitch
vocal apparatus consists pairs mucosal folds folds false vocal folds vestibular folds true vocal folds folds false vocal folds covered respiratory epithelium true vocal folds covered stratified squamous epithelium false vocal folds responsible sound production rather resonance exceptions found tibetan chant kargyraa style tuvan throat singing make false vocal folds create undertone false vocal folds contain muscle true vocal folds skeletal muscle

important role larynx protecting function prevention foreign objects entering lungs coughing reflexive actions cough initiated deep inhalation vocal folds followed elevation larynx tight adduction closing vocal folds forced expiration follows assisted tissue recoil muscles expiration blows vocal folds apart high pressure expels irritating object throat throat clearing less violent coughing similar increased respiratory effort countered tightening laryngeal musculature coughing throat clearing predictable necessary actions clear respiratory passageway place vocal folds significant strain8
another important role larynx abdominal fixation kind valsalva maneuver lungs filled order stiffen thorax forces applied lifting translated legs achieved deep inhalation followed adduction vocal folds grunting lifting heavy objects result escaping adducted vocal folds ready phonation8
abduction vocal folds important physical exertion vocal folds separated normal respiration width doubled forced respiration8
swallowing backward motion tongue forces epiglottis glottis opening prevent swallowed material entering larynx leads lungs larynx also pulled upwards assist process stimulation larynx ingested matter produces strong cough reflex protect lungs
addition intrinsic laryngeal muscles spared muscle wasting disorders duchenne muscular dystrophy facilitate development novel strategies prevention treatment muscle wasting variety clinical scenarios calcium regulation system profile suggestive better ability handle calcium changes comparison muscles provide mechanistic insight unique pathophysiological properties

tetrapod species possess larynx structure typically simpler found mammals cartilages surrounding larynx apparently remnant original gill arches fish common feature always present example thyroid cartilage found mammals similarly mammals possess true epiglottis although flap noncartilagenous mucosa found similar position many groups modern amphibians laryngeal skeleton considerably reduced frogs cricoid arytenoid cartilages salamanders possess arytenoids17
vocal folds found mammals lizards result many reptiles amphibians essentially voiceless frogs ridges trachea modulate sound birds separate soundproducing organ syrinx17
