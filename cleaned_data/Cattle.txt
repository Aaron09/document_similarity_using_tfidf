cattle ruminants meaning digestive system highly specialized allow poorly digestible plants food cattle stomach four compartments rumen reticulum omasum abomasum rumen largest compartment reticulum smallest compartment known honeycomb cattle sometimes consume metal objects deposited reticulum irritation metal objects causes hardware disease omasums main function absorb water nutrients digestible feed omasum known many plies abomasum like human stomach known true stomach
cattle known regurgitating rechewing food known chewing like ruminants animal feeding food swallowed without chewed goes rumen storage animal find quiet place continue digestion process food regurgitated mouthful time back mouth food called chewed molars grinding coarse vegetation small particles swallowed digested specialized microorganisms rumen microbes primarily responsible decomposing cellulose carbohydrates volatile fatty acids cattle primary metabolic fuel microbes inside rumen also synthesize amino acids nonprotein nitrogenous sources urea ammonia microbes reproduce rumen older generations cells continue digestive tract cells partially digested small intestines allowing cattle gain highquality protein source features allow cattle thrive grasses tough vegetation

senses
cattle five widely recognized sensory modalities assist complex behavioural patterns example grazing behaviour cattle mixed diets given opportunity show partial preference approximately clover grass preference diurnal pattern stronger preference clover morning proportion grass increasing towards evening73
vision
vision dominant sense cattle obtain almost information visually
cattle prey animal assist predator detection eyes located sides head rather front gives wide field view 330° limits binocular vision therefore stereopsis compared 140° humans5475 means blind spot directly behind cattle good visual acuity 12054 compared humans visual accommodation cattle poor74
cattle kinds color receptors cone cells retinas means cattle dichromatic nonprimate land mammals7677 three rods cone fovea centralis five near optic papilla75 cattle distinguish long wavelength colors yellow orange much better shorter wavelengths blue grey green calves able discriminate long short blue medium green wavelengths limited ability discriminate short medium also approach handlers quickly light78 whilst good color sensitivity good humans sheep54
common misconception cattle particularly bulls enraged color something provocative often said like flag bull myth bullfighting movement flag cape irritates bull incites charge79
taste
cattle welldeveloped sense taste distinguish four primary tastes sweet salty bitter sour possess around 20000 taste buds strength taste perception depends individuals current food requirements avoid bittertasting foods potentially toxic marked preference sweet high calorific value salty foods electrolyte balance sensitivity sourtasting foods helps maintain optimal ruminal ph74
plants levels sodium cattle developed capacity seeking salt taste smell cattle become depleted sodium salts show increased locomotion directed searching assist search olfactory gustatory receptors able detect minute amounts sodium salts increase sensitivity biochemical disruption develops sodium salt depletion8081
audition
cattle hearing ranges frequency best sensitivity lowest threshold μnm−2 means hearing acute horses lowest threshold db82 sound localization acuity thresholds average means cattle less able localise sounds compared goats dogs humans 08°83 cattle broad foveal fields view covering almost entire horizon need accurate locus information auditory systems direct gaze sound source
vocalisations important mode communication amongst cattle provide information dominance status reproductive status caller calves recognize mothers using vocal vocal behaviour play role indicating estrus competitive display bulls84
