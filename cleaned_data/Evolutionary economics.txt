another argument humans poor intuitive grasp economics current environment different ancestral environment ancestral environment likely relatively little trade division labor capital goods technological change slow wealth differences much smaller possession many available resources likely zerosum games large inequalities caused various forms exploitation humans therefore poor intuitive understanding benefits free trade causing calls protectionism value capital goods making labor theory value appealing intuitively undervalue benefits technological development9
tendency number available jobs zerosum game total number jobs fixed causes people realize minimum wage laws reduce number jobs believe increased number jobs nations necessarily decreases number jobs nation large income inequality easily viewed exploitation rather individual differences productivity easily cause poor economic policies especially since individual voters incentives make effort studying societal economics instead relying intuitions since individuals vote counts little since politicians reluctant take stand intuitive views incorrect widely held9
