decomposition begins moment death caused factors autolysis breaking tissues bodys internal chemicals enzymes putrefaction breakdown tissues bacteria processes release compounds cadaverine putrescine chief source unmistakably putrid odor decaying animal tissue
prime decomposers bacteria fungi though larger scavengers also play important role decomposition body accessible insects mites animals important arthropods involved process include carrion beetles mites34 fleshflies sarcophagidae blowflies calliphoridae greenbottle seen summer north america important noninsect animals typically involved process include mammal bird scavengers coyotes dogs wolves foxes rats crows vulturescitation needed scavengers also remove scatter bones ingest later time aquatic marine environments breakdown agents include bacteria fish crustaceans larvae carrion scavengers
stages decompositionedit
five general stages used describe process decomposition vertebrate animals fresh bloat active decay advanced decay dryremains6 general stages decomposition coupled stages chemical decomposition autolysis putrefaction7 stages contribute chemical process decomposition breaks main components body
freshedit
among animals heart fresh stage begins immediately heart stops beating moment death body begins cooling warming match temperature ambient environment stage called algor mortis8 shortly death within three hoursfor muscular tissues become rigid incapable relaxing stage called rigor mortis since blood longer pumped body gravity causes drain dependent portions body creating overall bluishpurple discolouration termed livor mortis commonly lividity
heart stops blood longer supply oxygen remove carbon dioxide tissues resulting decrease chemical changes cause cells lose structural integrity bringing release cellular enzymes capable initiating breakdown surrounding cells tissues process known autolysis
visible changes caused decomposition limited fresh stage although autolysis cause blisters appear surface skin9
small amount oxygen remaining body quickly depleted cellular metabolism aerobic microbes naturally present respiratory gastrointestinal tracts creating ideal environment proliferation anaerobic organisms multiply consuming bodys carbohydrates lipids proteins produce variety substances including propionic acid lactic acid methane hydrogen sulfide ammonia process microbial proliferation within body referred putrefaction leads second stage decomposition known bloat10
blowflies flesh flies first carrion insects arrive seek suitable oviposition site6
bloatedit
bloat stage provides first clear visual sign microbial proliferation underway stage anaerobic metabolism takes place leading accumulation gases hydrogen sulfide carbon dioxide methane nitrogen accumulation gases within bodily cavity causes distention abdomen gives cadaver overall bloated appearance11 gases produced also cause natural liquids liquefying tissues become frothy8 pressure gases within body increases fluids forced escape natural orifices nose mouth anus enter surrounding environment buildup pressure combined loss integrity skin also cause body rupture11
intestinal anaerobic bacteria transform haemoglobin sulfhemoglobin colored pigments associated gases accumulate within body time transport sulfhemoglobin throughout body circulatory lymphatic systems giving body overall marbled appearance12
insects access maggots hatch begin feed bodys tissues6 maggot activity typically confined natural orifices masses skin causes skin slip hair detach skin8 maggot feeding accumulation gases within body eventually leads postmortem skin ruptures allow purging gases fluids surrounding environment10 ruptures skin allow oxygen reenter body provide surface area development larvae activity aerobic microorganisms11 purging gases fluids results strong distinctive odors associated decay6
active decayedit
active decay characterized period greatest mass loss loss occurs result voracious feeding maggots purging decomposition fluids surrounding environment11 purged fluids accumulate around body create cadaver decomposition island liquefaction tissues disintegration become apparent time strong odors persist6 active decay signaled migration maggots away body pupate10
advanced decayedit
decomposition largely inhibited advanced decay loss readily available cadaveric material11 insect activity also reduced stage8 carcass located soil area surrounding show evidence vegetation death11 surrounding carcass display increase soil carbon nutrients phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium10 changes significant increase soil nitrogen13
dryremainsedit
dryremains stage resurgence plant growth around occur sign nutrients present surrounding soil returned normal levels11 remains cadaver stage skin cartilage bones6 become bleached exposed elements8 soft tissue removed cadaver referred completely skeletonized portions bones exposed referred partially skeletonised14
