historiography soviet dissolution roughly classified groups intentionalist accounts structuralist accounts
intentionalist accounts contend soviet collapse inevitable resulted policies decisions specific individuals usually gorbachev yeltsin characteristic example intentionalist writing historian archie browns gorbachev factor argues gorbachev main force soviet politics least period 1985–1988 even later largely spearheaded political reforms developments opposed events122 especially true policies perestroika glasnost market initiatives foreign policy stance political scientist george breslauer seconded labelling gorbachev events123 slightly different vein david kotz fred weir contended soviet elites responsible spurring nationalism capitalism could personally benefit also demonstrated continued presence higher economic political echelons postsoviet republics124
structuralist accounts contrast take deterministic view soviet dissolution outcome deeplyrooted structural issues planted timebomb example stephen walker argued minority nationalities denied power union level confronted culturallydestabilizing form economic modernization subjected certain amount russification time strengthened several policies pursued soviet regime indigenization leadership support local languages time created conscious nations furthermore basic legitimating myths soviet union federative system voluntary mutual union allied peoples eased task secession independence125 january 2016 russian president vladimir putin supported view calling lenins support right secession soviet republics delayaction bomb126
