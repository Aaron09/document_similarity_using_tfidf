development introduction firearmsedit
medievalstyle fortifications largely made obsolete arrival cannons 14th century battlefield fortifications black powder evolved much lower structures greater ditches earth ramparts would absorb disperse energy cannon fire walls exposed direct cannon fire vulnerable sunk ditches fronted earth slopes
placed heavy emphasis geometry fortification allow defensive cannonry interlocking fields fire cover approaches lower thus vulnerable walls
evolution style fortification seen transitional forts sarzanello27 north west italy built 1492 1502 sarzanello consists crenellated walls towers typical medieval period also ravelin like angular platform screening curtain walls protected flanking fire towers main part fort another example fortifications rhodes frozen 1522 rhodes european walled town still shows transition classical medieval fortification modern ones28

arrival explosive shells 19th century another stage evolution fortification star forts fare well effects high explosive intricate arrangements bastions flanking batteries carefully constructed lines fire defending cannon could rapidly disrupted explosive shells
worse large open ditches surrounding forts type integral part defensive scheme covered edge counter scarp ditch extremely vulnerable bombardment explosive shells
response military engineers evolved polygonal style fortification ditch became deep vertically sided directly native rock soil laid series straight lines creating central fortified area gives style fortification name

downfall permanent fortifications causes

everescalating power speed reach artillery power meant almost target could located could destroyed sufficient force massed resources defender devoted reinforcing fortification combat power fortification justified devoted destroying fortifications destruction demanded attackers strategy world bunker busters used fortifications 1950 nuclear weapons capable destroying entire cities produced dangerous radiation creation civilian nuclear raid shelters
second weakness permanent fortification permanency often easier around fortification rise mobile warfare beginning world became viable offensive choice defensive line extensive entirely bypassed massive offensive might could massed part line allowing breakthrough rest line could bypassed fate many defensive lines built world siegfried line stalin line atlantic wall case maginot line designed force germans invade countries belgium switzerland around successful sense30

instead field fortification rose dominate defensive action unlike trench warfare dominated world defences temporary nature advantage since less extensive formed less obvious target enemy force directed
sufficient power massed point penetrate forces based could withdrawn line could reestablished relatively quickly instead supposedly impenetrable defensive line fortifications emphasized defence depth defenders forced pull back overrun lines defenders behind could take defence
mobile offensives practised sides usually focused avoiding strongest points defensive line defences usually relatively thin spread along length line defence usually equally strong throughout however
strength defensive line area varied according rapidly attacking force could progress terrain defended—both terrain defensive line built ground behind attacker might hope break reasons strategic value ground defensive value
possible offensive tactics focused mobility defensive tactics defences consisted primarily infantry antitank guns defending tanks tank destroyers would concentrated mobile fire brigades behind defensive line major offensive launched point line mobile reinforcements would sent reinforce part line danger failing
thus defensive line could relatively thin bulk fighting power defenders concentrated line rather mobile reserves notable exception rule seen defensive lines battle kursk world german forces deliberately attacked strongest part soviet defences seeking crush utterly
terrain defended primary importance open terrain tanks could move quickly made possible rapid advances defenders rear areas dangerous defenders thus terrain defended cost
addition since theory defensive line hold long enough mobile reserves reinforce terrain permit rapid advance could held weakly enemys advance would slower giving defenders time reinforce point line example battle hurtgen forest germany closing stages world excellent example difficult terrain could used defenders advantage
world icbms capable reaching much around world developed speed became essential characteristic strongest militaries defenses missile silos developed missiles could fired middle country cities targets another country airplanes carriers became major defenses offensive weapons leading expansion airports airstrips fortifications mobile defenses could underwater form nuclear submarines capable firing missiles bunkers late 20th century came buried deep inside mountains prominent rocks gibraltar cheyenne mountain complex ground minefields used hidden defences modern warfare often remaining long wars produced ended
