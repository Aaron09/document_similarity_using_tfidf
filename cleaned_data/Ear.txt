human generally hear sounds frequencies audio range sounds outside range considered infrasound hz10 ultrasound khz11 although hearing requires intact functioning auditory portion central nervous system well working human deafness extreme insensitivity sound commonly occurs abnormalities inner rather nerves tracts central auditory system
balance
main articles balance ability equilibrioception
providing balance moving stationary also central function facilitates types balance static balance allows person feel effects gravity dynamic balance allows person sense acceleration
static balance provided ventricles utricle saccule cells lining walls ventricles contain fine filaments cells covered fine gelatinous layer cell 50–70 small filaments large filament kinocilium within gelatinous layer otoliths tiny formations calcium carbonate person moves otoliths shift position shift alters positions filaments opens channels within cell membranes creating depolarisation action potential transmitted brain along vestibulocochlear nerve912
dynamic balance provided three semicircular canals three canals orthogonal right angles canal slight enlargement known ampulla contains numerous cells filaments central area called cupula fluid canals rotates according momentum head person changes acceleration inertia fluid changes affects pressure cupula results opening channels causes depolarisation passed signal brain along vestibulocochlear nerve9 dynamic balance also helps maintain tracking moving vestibulo–ocular reflex
