historyedit
main article history natural language processing
history generally started 1950s although work found earlier periods 1950 alan turing published article titled computing machinery intelligence proposed called turing test criterion intelligence
georgetown experiment 1954 involved fully automatic translation sixty russian sentences english authors claimed within three five years machine translation would solved problem2 however real progress much slower alpac report 1966 found tenyearlong research failed fulfill expectations funding machine translation dramatically reduced little research machine translation conducted late 1980s first statistical machine translation systems developed
notably successful systems developed 1960s shrdlu natural language system working restricted blocks worlds restricted vocabularies eliza simulation rogerian psychotherapist written joseph weizenbaum 1964 1966 using almost information human thought emotion eliza sometimes provided startlingly humanlike interaction patient exceeded small knowledge base eliza might provide generic response example responding head hurts head hurts
1970s many programmers began write conceptual ontologies structured realworld information computerunderstandable data examples margie schank 1975 cullingford 1978 wilensky 1978 talespin meehan 1976 qualm lehnert 1977 politics carbonell 1979 plot units lehnert 1981 time many chatterbots written including parry racter jabberwacky
1980s systems based complex sets handwritten rules starting late 1980s however revolution introduction machine learning algorithms language processing steady increase computational power moores gradual lessening dominance chomskyan theories linguistics transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged sort corpus linguistics underlies machinelearning approach language processing3 earliestused machine learning algorithms decision trees produced systems hard ifthen rules similar existing handwritten rules however partofspeech tagging introduced hidden markov models increasingly research focused statistical models make soft probabilistic decisions based attaching realvalued weights features making input data cache language models upon many speech recognition systems rely examples statistical models models generally robust given unfamiliar input especially input contains errors common realworld data produce reliable results integrated larger system comprising multiple subtasks
many notable early successes occurred field machine translation especially work research successively complicated statistical models developed systems able take advantage existing multilingual textual corpora produced parliament canada european union result laws calling translation governmental proceedings official languages corresponding systems government however systems depended corpora specifically developed tasks implemented systems often continues major limitation success systems result great deal research gone methods effectively learning limited amounts data
recent research increasingly focused unsupervised semisupervised learning algorithms algorithms able learn data handannotated desired answers using combination annotated nonannotated data generally task much difficult supervised learning typically produces less accurate results given amount input data however enormous amount nonannotated data available including among things entire content world wide often make inferior results
recent years flurry results showing deep learning techniques45 achieving stateoftheart results many natural language tasks example language modeling6 parsing78 many others
statistical natural language processing snlpedit
since socalled statistical revolution910 late 1980s 1990s much natural language processing research relied heavily machine learning
formerly many languageprocessing tasks typically involved direct hand coding rules1112 general robust natural language variation machinelearning paradigm calls instead using statistical inference automatically learn rules analysis large corpora typical realworld examples corpus plural corpora documents possibly human computer annotations
many different classes machine learning algorithms applied tasks algorithms take input large features generated input data earliestused algorithms decision trees produced systems hard ifthen rules similar systems handwritten rules common increasingly however research focused statistical models make soft probabilistic decisions based attaching realvalued weights input feature models advantage express relative certainty many different possible answers rather producing reliable results model included component larger system
systems based machinelearning algorithms many advantages handproduced rules

learning procedures used machine learning automatically focus common cases whereas writing rules hand often obvious effort directed
automatic learning procedures make statistical inference algorithms produce models robust unfamiliar input containing words structures seen erroneous input misspelled words words accidentally omitted generally handling input gracefully handwritten rules—or generally creating systems handwritten rules make soft decisions—is extremely difficult errorprone timeconsuming
systems based automatically learning rules made accurate simply supplying input data however systems based handwritten rules made accurate increasing complexity rules much difficult task particular limit complexity systems based handcrafted rules beyond systems become unmanageable however creating data input machinelearning systems simply requires corresponding increase number manhours worked generally without significant increases complexity annotation process

major evaluations tasksedit
following list commonly researched tasks note tasks direct realworld applications others commonly serve subtasks used solving larger tasks
though tasks obviously closely intertwined frequently convenience subdivided categories coarse division given
syntaxedit

lemmatization
morphological segmentation
separate words individual morphemes identify class morphemes difficulty task depends greatly complexity morphology structure words language considered english fairly simple morphology especially inflectional morphology thus often possible ignore task entirely simply model possible forms word open opens opened opening separate words languages turkish meitei13 highly agglutinated indian language however approach possible dictionary entry thousands possible word forms
partofspeech tagging
given sentence determine part speech word many words especially common ones serve multiple parts speech example book noun book table verb book flight noun verb adjective least five different parts speech languages ambiguity others languages little inflectional morphology english particularly prone ambiguity chinese prone ambiguity tonal language verbalization inflection readily conveyed entities employed within orthography convey intended meaning
parsing
also stochastic grammar determine parse tree grammatical analysis given sentence grammar natural languages ambiguous typical sentences multiple possible analyses fact perhaps surprisingly typical sentence thousands potential parses seem completely nonsensical human primary types parsing dependency parsing constituency parsing dependency parsing focuses relationships words sentence marking things like primary objects predicates whereas constituency parsing focuses building parse tree using probabilistic contextfree grammar pcfg
sentence breaking also known sentence boundary disambiguation
given chunk text find sentence boundaries sentence boundaries often marked periods punctuation marks characters serve purposes marking abbreviations
stemming
word segmentation
separate chunk continuous text separate words language like english fairly trivial since words usually separated spaces however written languages like chinese japanese thai mark word boundaries fashion languages text segmentation significant task requiring knowledge vocabulary morphology words language
terminology extraction
goal terminology extraction automatically extract relevant terms given corpus

semanticsedit

lexical semantics
computational meaning individual words context
machine translation
automatically translate text human language another difficult problems member class problems colloquially termed aicomplete requiring different types knowledge humans possess grammar semantics facts real world order solve properly
named entity recognition
given stream text determine items text proper names people places type name person location organization note although capitalization recognizing named entities languages english information cannot determining type named entity case often inaccurate insufficient example first word sentence also capitalized named entities often span several words capitalized furthermore many languages nonwestern scripts chinese arabic capitalization even languages capitalization consistently distinguish names example german capitalizes nouns regardless whether refer names french spanish capitalize names serve adjectives
natural language generation
convert information computer databases semantic intents readable human language
natural language understanding
convert chunks text formal representations firstorder logic structures easier computer programs manipulate natural language understanding involves identification intended semantic multiple possible semantics derived natural language expression usually takes form organized notations natural languages concepts introduction creation language metamodel ontology efficient however empirical solutions explicit formalization natural languages semantics without confusions implicit assumptions closedworld assumption openworld assumption subjective yesno objective truefalse expected construction basis semantics formalization14
optical character recognition
given image representing printed text determine corresponding text
question answering
given humanlanguage question determine answer typical questions specific right answer capital canada sometimes openended questions also considered meaning life recent works looked even complex questions15
recognizing textual entailment
given text fragments determine true entails entails others negation allows either true false16
relationship extraction
given chunk text identify relationships among named entities married
sentiment analysis
extract subjective information usually documents often using online reviews determine polarity specific objects especially useful identifying trends public opinion social media purpose marketing
topic segmentation recognition
given chunk text separate segments devoted topic identify topic segment
word sense disambiguation
many words meaning select meaning makes sense context problem typically given list words associated word senses dictionary online resource wordnet

discourseedit

automatic summarization
produce readable summary chunk text often used provide summaries text known type articles financial section newspaper
coreference resolution
given sentence larger chunk text determine words mentions refer objects entities anaphora resolution specific example task specifically concerned matching pronouns nouns names refer general task coreference resolution also includes identifying socalled bridging relationships involving referring expressions example sentence entered johns house front door front door referring expression bridging relationship identified fact door referred front door johns house rather structure might also referred
discourse analysis
rubric includes number related tasks task identifying discourse structure connected text nature discourse relationships sentences elaboration explanation contrast another possible task recognizing classifying speech acts chunk text yesno question content question statement assertion

speechedit

speech recognition
given sound clip person people speaking determine textual representation speech opposite text speech extremely difficult problems colloquially termed aicomplete natural speech hardly pauses successive words thus speech segmentation necessary subtask speech recognition note also spoken languages sounds representing successive letters blend process termed coarticulation conversion analog signal discrete characters difficult process
speech segmentation
given sound clip person people speaking separate words subtask speech recognition typically grouped
