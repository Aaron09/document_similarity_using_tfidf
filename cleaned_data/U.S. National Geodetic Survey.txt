survey finally began surveying operations 1816 hassler started work vicinity york city first baseline measured verified 1817 however hassler taken surprise united states congress frustrated slow limited progress survey made first decade unwilling endure time expense involved scientifically precise surveying unconvinced propriety expending government funds scientific endeavors uncomfortable hassler leading effort foreign birth enacted legislation 1818 removing leadership survey suspending operations congress believed united states army united states navy officers could achieve surveying results adequate safe navigation routine navigation charting activities could quickly cheaply hassler gave army navy responsibility coastal surveys prohibited government hiring civilians conduct coastal surveys survey coast existed without superintendent without conducting surveys years 1818 18329
