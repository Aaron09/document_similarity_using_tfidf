etymologyedit
word asphalt derived late middle english turn french asphalte based late latin asphalton asphaltum latinisation greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos ásphalton word meaning asphaltbitumenpitch9 perhaps derives without σφάλλω sfallō make fall10 first asphalt ancients nature cement securing joining together various objects thus seems likely name expressive application specifically herodotus mentioned bitumen brought babylon build gigantic fortification wall11 greek word passed late latin thence french asphalte english asphaltum asphalt french term asphalte used naturally occurring asphaltsoaked limestone deposits specialised manufactured products fewer voids greater bitumen content asphaltic concrete used pave roads
expression bitumen originated sanskrit words jatu meaning pitch jatukrit meaning pitch creating pitch producing referring coniferous resinous trees latin equivalent claimed originally gwitumen pertaining pitch others pixtumens exuding bubbling pitch subsequently shortened bitumen thence passing french english root derived anglosaxon word cwidu mastix german word kitt cement mastic norse word kvada12
modern terminologyedit
british english bitumen used instead asphalt word asphalt instead used refer asphalt concrete mixture construction aggregate asphalt also called tarmac common parlance bitumen mixed clay usually called asphaltum13 term less commonly used todaycitation needed
australian english bitumen often used generic term road surfaces
american english asphalt equivalent british bitumen however asphalt also commonly used shortened form asphalt concrete therefore equivalent british asphalt tarmac
canadian english word bitumen used refer vast canadian deposits extremely heavy crude oil14 asphalt used refinery product diluted bitumen diluted naphtha make flow pipelines known dilbit canadian petroleum industry bitumen upgraded synthetic crude known syncrude syncrude blended bitumen called synbit15
bitumen still preferred geological term naturally occurring deposits solid semisolid form petroleum bituminous rock form sandstone impregnated bitumen sands alberta canada similar material
neither terms asphalt bitumen confused coal tarsfurther explanation needed
compositionedit
also asphaltene
components asphalt include four main classes compounds

naphthene aromatics naphthalene consisting partially hydrogenated polycyclic aromatic compounds
polar aromatics consisting high molecular weight phenols carboxylic acids produced partial oxidation material
saturated hydrocarbons percentage saturated compounds asphalt correlates softening point
asphaltenes consisting high molecular weight phenols heterocyclic compounds

naphthene aromatics polar aromatics typically majority components natural bitumens also contain organosulfur compounds resulting overall sulfur content nickel vanadium found parts million typical petroleum5
substance soluble carbon disulfide commonly modelled colloid asphaltenes dispersed phase maltenes continuous phase16 almost impossible separate identify different molecules asphalt number molecules different chemical structure extremely large17
asphalt confused coal visually similar black thermoplastic material produced destructive distillation coal early mid20th century town produced coal readily available byproduct extensively used binder road aggregates addition coal macadam roads word tarmac used common parlance refer roadmaking materials however since 1970s natural succeeded town asphalt completely overtaken coal applications examples confusion include brea pits canadian sands actually contain natural bitumen rather pitch another term sometimes informally used times refer asphalt pitch lake
