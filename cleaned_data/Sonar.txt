principle active sonar


active sonar uses sound transmitter receiver place monostatic operation transmitter receiver separated bistatic operation transmitters receivers used spatially separated multistatic operation sonars used monostatically array often used transmission reception active sonobuoy fields operated multistatically
active sonar creates pulse sound often called ping listens reflections echo pulse pulse sound generally created electronically using sonar projector consisting signal generator power amplifier electroacoustic transducerarray beamformer usually employed concentrate acoustic power beam swept cover required search angles generally electroacoustic transducers tonpilz type design optimised achieve maximum efficiency widest bandwidth order optimise performance overall system occasionally acoustic pulse created means chemically using explosives airguns plasma sound sources

passive sonar listens without transmitting often employed military settings although also used science applications detecting fish presenceabsence studies various aquatic environments also passive acoustics passive radar broadest usage term encompass virtually analytical technique involving remotely generated sound though usually restricted techniques applied aquatic environment
identifying sound sources
passive sonar wide variety techniques identifying source detected sound example vessels usually operate alternating current power systems transformers generators mounted without proper vibration insulation hull become flooded sound windings emitted submarine ship help identify nationality european submarines nearly every nations submarine power systems intermittent sound sources wrench dropped also detectable passive sonar fairly recentlywhen experienced trained operator identified signals computers
passive sonar systems large sonic databases sonar operator usually finally classifies signals manually computer system frequently uses databases identify classes ships actions speed ship type weapon released even particular ships publications classification sounds provided continually updated office naval intelligence
noise limitations
passive sonar vehicles usually severely limited noise generated vehicle reason many submarines operate nuclear reactors cooled without pumps using silent convection fuel cells batteries also silently vehicles propellers also designed precisely machined emit minimal noise highspeed propellers often create tiny bubbles water cavitation distinct sound

sound propagation
sonar operation affected variations sound speed particularly vertical plane sound travels slowly fresh water water though difference small speed determined waters bulk modulus mass density bulk modulus affected temperature dissolved impurities usually salinity pressure density effect small speed sound feet second approximately

empirically derived approximation equation reasonably accurate normal temperatures concentrations salinity range ocean depths ocean temperature varies depth meters often marked change called thermocline dividing warmer surface water cold still waters make rest ocean frustrate sonar sound originating side thermocline tends bent refracted thermocline thermocline present shallower coastal waters however wave action often water column eliminate thermocline water pressure also affects sound propagation higher pressure increases sound speed causes sound waves refract away area higher sound speed mathematical model refraction called snells
sound source deep conditions right propagation occur deep sound channel provides extremely propagation loss receiver channel sound trapping channel losses boundaries similar propagation occur surface duct suitable conditions however case reflection losses surface
shallow water propagation generally repeated reflection surface bottom considerable losses occur
sound propagation affected absorption water well surface bottom absorption depends upon frequency several different mechanisms water longrange sonar uses frequencies minimise absorption effects

military applications
modern naval warfare makes extensive passive active sonar waterborne vessels aircraft fixed installations although active sonar used surface craft world submarines avoided active sonar potential revealing presence position enemy forces however advent modern signalprocessing enabled passive sonar primary means search detection operations 1987 division japanese company toshiba reportedly sold machinery soviet union allowed submarine propeller blades milled became radically quieter making newer generation submarines difficult detect
active sonar submarine determine bearing extremely rare necessarily give high quality bearing range information submarines fire control team however active sonar surface ships common used submarines tactical situation dictates important determine position hostile submarine conceal position surface ships might assumed threat already tracking ship satellite data vessel around emitting sonar detect emission heard signal easy identify sonar equipment used usually frequency position sound waves energy active sonar similar radar allows detection targets certain range also enables emitter detected greater range undesirable
since active sonar reveals presence position operator allow exact classification targets used fast planes helicopters noisy platforms surface ships rarely submarines active sonar used surface ships submarines typically activated briefly intermittent periods minimize risk detection consequently active sonar normally considered backup passive sonar aircraft active sonar used form disposable sonobuoys dropped aircrafts patrol area vicinity possible enemy sonar contacts
passive sonar several advantages importantly silent target radiated noise level high enough greater range active sonar allows target identified since motorized object makes noise principle detected depending level noise emitted ambient noise level area well technology used simplify passive sonar sees around ship using submarine nosemounted passive sonar detects directions 270° centered ships alignment hullmounted array 160° side towed array full 360° invisible areas ships interference signal detected certain direction means something makes sound direction called broadband detection possible zoom analyze signal received narrowband analysis generally done using fourier transform show different frequencies making sound since every engine makes specific sound straightforward identify object databases unique engine sounds part known acoustic intelligence acint
