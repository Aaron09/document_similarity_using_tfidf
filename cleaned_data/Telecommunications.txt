conceptsedit
modern telecommunication founded series concepts experienced progressive development refinement period well century
basic elementsedit
telecommunication technologies primarily divided wired wireless methods overall though basic telecommunication system consists three main parts always present form another

transmitter takes information converts signal
transmission medium also called physical channel carries signal example free space channel
receiver takes signal channel converts back usable information recipient

example radio broadcasting station stations large power amplifier transmitter broadcasting antenna interface power amplifier free space channel free space channel transmission medium receivers antenna interface free space channel receiver next radio receiver destination radio signal converted electricity sound people listen
sometimes telecommunication systems duplex twoway systems single electronics working transmitter receiver transceiver example cellular telephone transceiver36 transmission electronics receiver electronics within transceiver actually quite independent readily explained fact radio transmitters contain power amplifiers operate electrical powers measured watts kilowatts radio receivers deal radio powers measured microwatts nanowatts hence transceivers carefully designed built isolate highpower circuitry lowpower circuitry cause interference
telecommunication fixed lines called pointtopoint communication transmitter receiver telecommunication radio broadcasts called broadcast communication powerful transmitter numerous lowpower sensitive radio receivers36
telecommunications multiple transmitters multiple receivers designed cooperate share physical channel called multiplex systems sharing physical channels using multiplexing often gives large reductions costs multiplexed systems laid telecommunication networks multiplexed signals switched nodes correct destination terminal receiver
analog versus digital communicationsedit
communications signals sent either analog signals digital signals analog communication systems digital communication systems analog signal signal varied continuously respect information digital signal information encoded discrete values example ones zeros propagation reception information contained analog signals inevitably degraded undesirable physical noise output transmitter noisefree practical purposes commonly noise communication system expressed adding subtracting desirable signal completely random form noise called additive noise understanding noise negative positive different instants time noise additive noise much difficult situation describe analyze kinds noise omitted
hand unless additive noise disturbance exceeds certain threshold information contained digital signals remain intact resistance noise represents advantage digital signals analog signals37
telecommunication networksedit
telecommunications network collection transmitters receivers communications channels send messages another digital communications networks contain routers work together transmit information correct user analog communications network consists switches establish connection users types network repeaters necessary amplify recreate signal transmitted long distances combat attenuation render signal indistinguishable noise38 another advantage digital systems analog output easier store memory voltage states high easier store continuous range states
communication channelsedit
term channel different meanings meaning channel physical medium carries signal transmitter receiver examples include atmosphere sound communications glass optical fibers kinds optical communications coaxial cables communications voltages electric currents free space communications using visible light infrared waves ultraviolet light radio waves coaxial cable types classified type radio guide terminology derived world various designations used classify specific signal transmission applications39 last channel called free space channel sending radio waves place another nothing presence absence atmosphere radio waves travel perfect vacuum easily travel clouds kind
meaning term channel telecommunications seen phrase communications channel subdivision transmission medium used send multiple streams information simultaneously example radio station broadcast radio waves free space frequencies neighborhood megahertz another radio station simultaneously broadcast radio waves frequencies neighborhood radio station would transmit radio waves frequency bandwidth kilohertz centered frequencies called carrier frequencies station example separated adjacent stations difference engineering allowance imperfections communication system
example free space channel divided communications channels according frequencies channel assigned separate frequency bandwidth broadcast radio waves system dividing medium channels according frequency called frequencydivision multiplexing another term concept wavelengthdivision multiplexing commonly used optical communications multiple transmitters share physical medium
another dividing communications medium channels allocate sender recurring segment time time slot example milliseconds second allow sender send messages within time slot method dividing medium communication channels called timedivision multiplexing used optical fiber communication radio communication systems within allocated channel hence systems hybrid
modulationedit
shaping signal convey information known modulation modulation used represent digital message analog waveform commonly called keying term derived older morse code telecommunications several keying techniques exist include phaseshift keying frequencyshift keying amplitudeshift keying bluetooth system example uses phaseshift keying exchange information various devices4041 addition combinations phaseshift keying amplitudeshift keying called jargon field quadrature amplitude modulation used highcapacity digital radio communication systems
modulation also used transmit information lowfrequency analog signals higher frequencies helpful lowfrequency analog signals cannot effectively transmitted free space hence information lowfrequency analog signal must impressed higherfrequency signal known carrier wave transmission several different modulation schemes available achieve basic amplitude modulation frequency modulation example process disc jockeys voice impressed carrier wave using frequency modulation voice would received radio channel fm42 addition modulation advantage frequency division multiplexing

macroeconomicsedit
macroeconomic scale larshendrik röller leonard waverman suggested causal link good telecommunication infrastructure economic growth4647 dispute existence correlation although argue wrong view relationship causal48
economic benefits good telecommunication infrastructure increasing worry inequitable access telecommunication services amongst various countries world—this known digital divide 2003 survey international telecommunication union revealed roughly third countries fewer mobile subscription every people onethird countries fewer landline telephone subscription every people terms internet access roughly half countries fewer people internet access information well educational data able compile index measures overall ability citizens access information communication technologies49 using measure sweden denmark iceland received highest ranking african countries nigeria burkina faso mali received lowest50
social impactedit
telecommunication played significant role social relationships nevertheless devices like telephone system originally advertised emphasis practical dimensions device ability conduct business order home services opposed social dimensions late 1920s 1930s social dimensions device became prominent theme telephone advertisements promotions started appealing consumers emotions stressing importance social conversations staying connected family friends51
since role telecommunications played social relations become increasingly important recent years popularity social networking sites increased dramatically sites allow users communicate well post photographs events profiles others profiles list persons interests sexual preference relationship status sites play important role everything organising social engagements courtship52
prior social networking sites technologies like short message service telephone also significant impact social interactions 2000 market research group ipsos mori reported 24yearold users united kingdom used service coordinate social arrangements flirt53
