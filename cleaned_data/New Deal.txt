essentially consensus among historians academics deal brought large increase power federal government scholarly debate concerning results federal expansion historians like arthur schlesinger james patterson argued augmentation federal government exacerbated tensions federal state governments however contemporaries katznelson suggested certain conditions allocation federal funds namely individual states control federal government managed avoid tension states rights prominent debate concerning historiography federalism united states schlesinger patterson observed deal marked federalstate power balance shifted favor federal government heightened tensions levels government united states
katznelson argued although federal government expanded power began providing welfare benefits scale previously unknown united states often allowed individual states control allocation funds provided welfare meant states controlled access funds turn meant many southern states able racially segregate cases like number counties georgia completely exclude africanamericans—the allocation federal funds208 enabled states continue relatively exercise rights also preserve institutionalization racist order societies katznelson conceded expansion federal government potential lead federalstate tension argued avoided states managed retain control katznelson observed furthermore state governments south manage strain potentially might placed local practices investing authority federal bureaucracies… guard outcome mechanism deployed separation source funding decisions spend monies209

moreover schlesinger argued federalstate tension oneway street federal government became aggravated state governments state governments often guilty inhibiting delaying federal policies whether intentional methods like sabotage unintentional ones like simple administrative overload either problems aggravated federal government thus heightened federalstate tensions schlesinger also noted students public administration never taken sufficient account capacity lower levels government sabotage defy even masterful president211
james patterson reiterated argument however observes increased tension accounted political perspective economic patterson argued tension federal state governments also least partly resulted economic strain states federal governments various policies agencies states either simply unable cope federal governments demand thus refused work admonished economic restraints actively decided sabotage federal policies demonstrated patterson noted handling federal relief money ohio governor martin davey case ohio became detrimental federal government harry hopkins supervisor federal emergency relief administration federalize ohio relief212 although argument differs somewhat schlesingers source federalstate tension remained growth federal government patterson asserted though record fera remarkably good—almost revolutionary—in respects inevitable given financial requirements imposed deficitridden states friction would develop governors federal officials213
