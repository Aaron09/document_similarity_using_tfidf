functional morphology study relationship structure function morphological features
experimental morphology study effects external factors upon morphology organisms experimental conditions effect genetic mutation
anatomy branch morphology deals structure organisms7

morphology classificationedit
taxa differ morphologically taxa typically closely related taxa differ much less distantly related ones exceptions cryptic species species look similar perhaps even outwardly identical reproductively isolated conversely sometimes unrelated taxa acquire similar appearance result convergent evolution even mimicry addition morphological differences within species apoica flavissima queens significantly smaller workers problem relying morphological data appear morphologically speaking distinct species fact shown analysis single species significance differences examined allometric engineering species manipulated phenocopy species
cell morphologyclassificationedit
invention development microscopy enable observation cell morphology high spatial temporal resolution dynamic processes cell morphology controlled complex system play important role varied important biological process immune invasive responses8
