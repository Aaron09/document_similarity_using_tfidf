celestial 17th century cartographer frederik


cartography mapmaking study practice crafting representations earth upon flat surface history cartography makes maps called cartographer
road maps perhaps widely used maps today form subset navigational maps also include aeronautical nautical charts railroad network maps hiking bicycling maps terms quantity largest number drawn sheets probably made local surveys carried municipalities utilities assessors emergency services providers local agencies many national surveying projects carried military british ordnance survey civilian government agency internationally renowned comprehensively detailed work
addition location information maps also used portray contour lines indicating constant values elevation temperature rainfall
orientation mapsedit




hereford mappa mundi 1300 hereford cathedral england classic jerusalem centre east toward europe bottom left africa right


orientation relationship directions corresponding compass directions reality word orient derived latin oriens meaning east middle ages many maps including maps drawn east meaning direction corresponds east compass common cartographic convention north
maps oriented north

maps nonwestern traditions oriented variety ways maps show japanese imperial palace also centre labels oriented cannot read properly unless imperial palace headcitation needed
medieval european maps hereford mappa mundi centred jerusalem east indeed prior reintroduction ptolemys geography europe around 1400 single convention west portolan charts example oriented shores describe
maps cities bordering often conventionally oriented
route channel maps traditionally oriented road waterway describe
polar maps arctic antarctic regions conventionally centred pole direction north would towards away centre respectively typical maps arctic meridian towards bottom page maps antarctic meridian towards page
reversed maps also known upsidedown maps southup maps reverse north convention south
buckminster fullers dymaxion maps based projection earths sphere onto icosahedron resulting triangular pieces arranged order orientation
modern digital maps arcmap typically project north math degrees east degrees increase counterclockwise rather compass degrees north degrees increase clockwise orientation transects compass decimal degrees converted math degrees subtracting answer greater subtract

scale accuracyedit




global view europe western asia africa


many maps drawn scale expressed ratio 110000 means unit measurement corresponds 10000 unit ground scale statement accurate region mapped small enough curvature earth neglected city mapping larger regions curvature cannot ignored requires projections curved surface earth plane impossibility flattening sphere plane without distortion means cannot constant scale rather projections best attained accurate scale along paths projection scale differs everywhere measured meaningfully point scale location maps strive keep point scale variation within narrow bounds although scale statement nominal usually accurate enough purposes unless covers large fraction earth scope world scale single number practically meaningless throughout instead usually refers scale along equator
large scale maps 110000 cover relatively small regions great detail small scale maps 110000000 cover large regions nations continents whole globe largesmall terminology arose practice writing scales numerical fractions 110000 larger 110000000 exact dividing line large small 1100000 might well considered medium scale examples large scale maps 125000 maps produced hikers hand maps intended motorists 1250000 11000000 small scale
important recognize even accurate maps sacrifice certain amount accuracy scale deliver greater visual usefulness user example width roads small streams exaggerated narrow shown true scale printed would narrower could perceived naked applies computer maps smallest unit pixel narrow stream must shown width pixel even scale would small fraction pixel width




cartogram distorted show population distributions


maps called cartograms scale deliberately distorted reflect information land area distance example right europe distorted show population distribution rough shape continent still discernible
another example distorted scale famous london underground basic geographical structure respected tube lines river thames smoothed clarify relationships stations near center stations spaced near edges
inaccuracies deliberate example cartographers simply omit military installations remove features solely order enhance clarity example road show railroads smaller waterways prominent nonroad objects even show less clearly dashed dotted linesoutlines main roads known decluttering practice makes subject matter user interested easier read usually without sacrificing overall accuracy softwarebased maps often allow user toggle decluttering auto needed auto degree decluttering adjusted user changes scale displayed

even involved cartographers variety computer graphics programs generate maps
interactive computerised maps commercially available allowing users zoom zoom respectively meaning increase decrease scale sometimes replacing another different scale centered possible point incar global navigation satellite systems computerised maps routeplanning advice facilities monitor users position help satellites computer scientists point view zooming entails combination

replacing detailed
enlarging without enlarging pixels hence showing detail removing less information compared less detailed version
enlarging pixels enlarged replaced rectangles pixels additional detail shown depending quality ones vision possibly detail seen computer display show adjacent pixels really separate overlapping instead apply apply cathode tube replacing pixel rectangle pixels show detail variation method interpolation





world format


example

typically applies portable document format file format based vector graphics increase detail course limited information contained file enlargement curve eventually result series standard geometric figures straight lines arcs circles splines
apply text outline feature forest building
apply text needed displaying labels features applies rest image text necessarily enlarged zooming similarly road represented double line become wider zooms
also layers partly raster graphics partly vector graphics single raster graphics image applies pixels image file correspond pixels display thereafter applies

climatic mapsedit
maps reflect territorial distribution climatic conditions based results longterm observations climatic maps climatic maps compiled individual climatic features temperature precipitation humidity combinations earth’s surface upper layers atmosphere climatic maps afford convenient overview climatic features large region permit values climatic features compared different parts region interpolation maps used determine values climatic features particular spot
climatic maps generally apply individual months year whole sometimes four seasons growing period forth maps compiled observations ground meteorological stations atmospheric pressure converted level temperature maps compiled actual values observed surface earth values converted level pressure field free atmosphere represented either maps distribution pressure different standard altitudes—for example every kilometer level—or maps baric topography altitudes precisely geopotentials main isobaric surfaces example millibars counted level plotted temperature humidity wind aeroclimatic maps apply either standard altitudes main isobaric surfaces
isolines drawn maps climatic features longterm mean values atmospheric pressure temperature humidity total precipitation forth connect points equal values feature question—for example isobars pressure isotherms temperature isohyets precipitation isoamplitudes drawn maps amplitudes example annual amplitudes temperature—that differences mean temperatures warmest coldest month isanomals drawn maps anomalies example deviations mean temperature place mean temperature entire latitudinal zone isolines frequency drawn maps showing frequency particular phenomenon example annual number days thunderstorm snow cover isochrones drawn maps showing dates onset given phenomenon example first frost appearance disappearance snow cover date particular value meteorological element course year example passing mean daily temperature zero isolines mean numerical value wind velocity isotachs drawn wind maps charts wind resultants directions prevailing winds indicated arrows different length arrows different plumes lines flow often drawn maps zonal meridional components wind frequently compiled free atmosphere atmospheric pressure wind usually combined climatic maps wind roses curves showing distribution meteorological elements diagrams annual course elements individual stations like also plotted climatic maps
maps climatic regionalization division earth’s surface climatic zones regions according classification climates special kind climatic
climatic maps often incorporated climatic atlases varying geographic range globe hemispheres continents countries oceans included comprehensive atlases besides general climatic maps applied climatic maps atlases great practical value aeroclimatic maps aeroclimatic atlases agroclimatic maps numerous
conventional signsedit
various features shown represented conventional signs symbols example colors used indicate classification roads signs usually explained margin separately published characteristic sheet1
cartographers prefer make cover practically entire screen sheet paper leaving room outside information whole cartographers typically place information otherwise blank region inside map—cartouche legend title compass rose scale particular maps contain smaller submaps otherwise blank regions—often much smaller scale showing whole globe whole fits globe showing regions interest larger scale order show details wouldnt otherwise occasionally submaps scale large map—a maps contiguous united states include submap scale noncontiguous states
also japanese symbols
labelingedit
communicate spatial information effectively features rivers lakes cities need labeled centuries cartographers developed placing names even densest maps text placement name placement mathematically complex number labels density increases therefore text placement timeconsuming laborintensive cartographers users developed automatic label placement ease process23
nongeographical spatial mapsedit
maps exist solar system cosmological features star maps addition maps bodies moon planets technically geographical maps
spatial mapsedit
diagrams schematic diagrams gantt charts treemaps display logical relationships items display spatial relationships
maps example london underground topological maps topological nature distances completely unimportant connectivity significant
generalpurpose mapsedit
generalpurpose maps provide many types information atlas maps wall maps road maps fall category following features might shown generalpurpose maps bodies water roads railway lines parks elevations towns cities political boundaries latitude longitude national provincial parks maps give broad understanding location features area reader gain understanding type landscape location urban places location major transportation routes
