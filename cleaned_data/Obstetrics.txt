dating scan weeks


obstetric ultrasonography routinely used dating gestational pregnancy size fetus determine number fetuses placentae evaluate ectopic pregnancy first trimester bleeding accurate dating first trimester growth foetus significantly influenced factors ultrasound also used detecting congenital anomalies foetal anomalies determining biophysical profiles generally easier detect second trimester foetal structures larger developed specialised ultrasound equipment also evaluate blood flow velocity umbilical cord looking detect decreaseabsencereversal diastolic blood flow umbilical artery
xrays computerized tomography used especially first trimester ionizing radiation teratogenic effects foetus effects magnetic resonance imaging foetus demonstrated1 technique expensive routine observation instead obstetric ultrasonography imaging method choice first trimester throughout pregnancy emits radiation portable allows realtime imaging
safety frequent ultrasound scanning confirmed despite increasing numbers women choosing additional scans medical purpose gender scans scans normal gestation would reveal gestational yolk fetal pole gestational assessed evaluating mean gestational diameter week crownrump length week multiple gestation evaluated number placentae amniotic sacs present
tools used assessment include

fetal screening used help assess viability fetus well congenital abnormalities
fetal karyotype used screening genetic diseases obtained amniocentesis chorionic villus sampling
foetal haematocrit assessment foetal anemia isoimmunization hydrops determined percutaneous umbilical blood sampling pubs done placing needle abdomen uterus taking portion umbilical cord
fetal lung maturity associated much surfactant fetus producing reduced production surfactant indicates decreased lung maturity high risk factor infant respiratory distress syndrome typically lecithinsphingomyelin ratio greater associated increased lung maturity
nonstress test fetal heart rate
oxytocin challenge test

intercurrent diseasesedit
main article intercurrent disease pregnancy
pregnant woman intercurrent diseases diseases conditions directly caused pregnancy become worse potential risk pregnancy

diabetes mellitus pregnancy deals interactions diabetes mellitus restricted gestational diabetes pregnancy risks child include miscarriage growth restriction growth acceleration feotal obesity macrosomia polyhydramnios birth defects
systemic lupus erythematosus pregnancy confers increased rate foetal death utero spontaneous abortion miscarriage well neonatal lupus
thyroid disease pregnancy uncorrected cause adverse effects foetal maternal wellbeing deleterious effects thyroid dysfunction also extend beyond pregnancy delivery affect neurointellectual development early life child demand thyroid hormones increased pregnancy cause previously unnoticed thyroid disorder worsen
hypercoagulability pregnancy propensity pregnant women develop thrombosis blood clots pregnancy factor hypercoagulability pregnancyinduced hypercoagulability physiologically adaptive mechanism prevent post partum bleeding2 however combined additional underlying hypercoagulable states risk thrombosis embolism become substantial2

induction labouredit
main articles induction birth childbirth
information pain management childbirth
induction method artificially prematurely stimulating labour woman reasons induce include preeclampsia foetal distress placental malfunction intrauterine growth retardation failure progress labour increasing risk infection foetal distresses
induction achieved several methods

disturbance cervical memebranes
pessary prostin cream prostaglandin
intravaginal oral administration misoprostol
cervical insertion 30ml foley catheter
rupturing amniotic membranes
intravenous infusion synthetic oxytocin pitocin syntocinon

labour obstetrician carries following tasks

midwives assisting woman labour birth chair 16th century work eucharius rößlin


prior 18th century caring pregnant women europe confined exclusively women rigorously excluded expectant mother would invite close female friends family members home keep company3 skilled midwives managed aspects labour delivery presence physicians surgeons rare occurred serious complication taken place midwife exhausted measures manage complication calling surgeon much last resort deliver women whatsoever seen offending female modesty45
18th centuryedit
obstetrics prior 18th 19th centuries recognized specific specialty however subject matter interest female reproductive system sexual practice traced back ancient egypt6 ancient greece7 soranus ephesus sometimes called important figure ancient gynecology living late first century early second century studied anatomy opinions techniques abortion contraception –most notably coitus interruptus– birth complications death soranus techniques works gynecology declined little works recorded survived late 18th century gynaecology obstetrics reemerged8
18th centuryedit
18th century marked beginning many advances european midwifery advances knowledge mainly regarding physiology pregnancy labour century medical professionals began understand anatomy uterus physiological changes take place labour introduction forceps childbirth also took place 18th century medical advances obstetrics lever introduction arena previously managed women—midwifery9
addition malemidwife historically significant change profession obstetrics 18th century medical began train area childbirth believed advanced knowledge anatomy childbirth could improved france malemidwives referred accoucheurs title later lent malemidwives europe founding lyinghospitals also contributed medicalization maledominance obstetrics lyinghospitals establishments women would come babies delivered prior unheard since midwife normally came home pregnant woman institution provided malemidwives accoucheurs endless number patients practice techniques also demonstrate knowledge10
many midwives time bitterly opposed involvement childbirth male practitioners also opposed involvement medical like midwifery even went menmidwives undertook midwifery solely perverse erotic satisfaction accoucheurs argued involvement midwifery improve process childbirth also believed obstetrics would forge ahead continue strengthen4
19th centuryedit
even 18th century physicians expected obstetrics would continue grow opposite happened obstetrics entered stage stagnation 19th century lasted 1880s3 central explanation lack advancement time substantially rejection obstetrics medical community 19th century marked medical reform europe increased regulation medical profession major european institutions college physicians surgeons considered delivering babies ungentlemanly work refused anything childbirth whole even medical 1858 introduced stated medical students could qualify doctors midwifery entirely ignored made nearly impossible pursue education midwifery also recognition doctor surgeon obstetrics pushed side11
late 19th century foundation modernday obstetrics midwifery began developing delivery babies doctors became popular readily accepted midwives continued play role childbirth midwifery also changed increased regulation eventual need midwives become certified many european countries late 19th century monitoring training midwives issued certification based competency midwives longer uneducated formal sense12
midwifery began develop profession obstetrics near century childbirth longer unjustifiably despised medical community beginning century specialty still behind development stages comparison medical specialities remained generality many male physicians would deliver children would referred obstetricians 19th century mark significant accomplishment profession advancements asepsis anaesthesia paved mainstream introduction later success caesarean section1213
1880s mortality rates lyinghospitals would reach unacceptably high levels became area public concern much maternal deaths puerperal fever time commonly known childbed fever 1800s ignaz semmelweis noticed women giving birth home much lower incidence childbed fever giving birth physicians lyinghospitals investigation discovered washing hands antiseptic solution delivery reduced childbed fever fatalities 9014 concluded physicians spreading disease labouring mother next despite publication information doctors still would wash 20th century advancements aseptic technique understanding disease would play significant role decrease maternal mortality rates among many populations
history obstetrics americaedit
development obstetrics practice accredited doctors happened turn 18th century thus differently developed europe americas independence many countries americas european powers “unlike europe british isles midwifery laws national america midwifery laws local varied widely”15
gynaecology obstetrics gained attention american medical field nineteenth century development procedures ovariotomy procedures shared european surgeons replicated surgeries noted period antiseptic aseptic anaesthetic measures introduced surgical observational procedures without procedures surgeries dangerous often fatal following surgeons noted contributions fields include ephraim mcdowell james marion sims
ephraim mcdowell developed surgical practice 1795 performed first ovariotomy 1809 47yearold widow lived thirtyone years attempted share john bell practiced retired italy bell said died without seeing document published associate extractions diseased ovaria 1825 midcentury surgery successfully unsuccessfully performed pennsylvanian surgeons attlee brothers made procedure routine total surgeries–john attlee performed successfully brother william reported 387– years 1843 1883 middle nineteenth century procedure successfully performed europe english surgeons spencer wells charles clay well french surgeons eugène koeberlé auguste nélaton jules péan16
marion sims surgeon responsible first treating vesicovaginal fistula 16–a condition linked many caused mainly prolonged pressing feotus pelvis causes rape hysterectomy operations– also doctor many european royals 20th president united states james garfield shot sims controversial medical past beliefs time pain prejudice towards african people practiced surgical skills developed skills slaves17 women first patients modern gynecology women operated named anarcha woman first treated fistula18
historical role genderedit
women inhabited different roles natal care 18th century role physician exclusively held went university overly male institution would theorize anatomy process reproduction based theological teaching philosophy many beliefs female body menstruation 17th 18th centuries inaccurate clearly resulting lack literature practice19 many theories caused menstruation prevailed hippocratic philosophy20 midwives time assisted birth care born unborn children name suggests position held mainly women
birth child rarely present women neighbourhood family would join process birth assist many different ways position would help birth child would sitting position usually performed side support mother21
introduced field obstetrics nineteenth century resulted change focus profession gynaecology directly resulted separate field study obstetrics focused curing illness indispositions female sexual organs relevance conditions menopause uterine cervical problems childbirth could leave mother need extensive surgery repair tissue also large blame uterus completely unrelated conditions many social consequences nineteenth century19
