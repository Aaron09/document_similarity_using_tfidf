clock failureedit
2017 announced three rubidium atomic clocks board irnss1a failed mirroring similar failures european unions galileo constellation first failure occurred july 2016 following clocks also failed rendered satellite somewhat redundant required replacement although satellite still performs functions data coarse thus cannot used accurate measurements35 isros attempt replace irnss1h unsuccessful pslvc39 mission failed august 20179
clocks navigational system started showing signs abnormality thereby taking total number failed clocks five9
precaution extend operational life navigation satellite isro running rubidium atomic clock instead remaining satellites9 satellite three clocks therefore total clocks satellites system including standby satellites clocks irnss galileo supplied spectratime3637 isro replaced atomic clocks standby navic satellites9 setback comes time irnss start commercial operations
