standard weights measures developed indus valley civilisation3 centralised weight measure system served commercial interest indus merchants smaller weight measures used measure luxury goods larger weights employed buying bulkier items food grains etc4 weights existed multiples standard weight categories4 technical standardisation enabled gauging devices effectively used angular measurement measurement construction5 uniform units length used planning towns lothal surkotada kalibangan dolavira harappa mohenjodaro3 weights measures indus civilisation also reached persia central asia modified6 shigeo iwata describes excavated weights unearthed indus civilisation

total weights excavated mohenjodaro harappa chanhudaro including defective weights find statistically significant differences weights excavated five different layers measuring depth evidence strong control existed least 500year period 137g weight seems units used indus valley notation based binary decimal systems weights excavated three cities cubic made chert3

18th century attemptsedit




henry maudslays famous early screwcutting lathes circa 1797 1800


implementation standards industry commerce became highly important onset industrial revolution need highprecision machine tools interchangeable parts
henry maudslay developed first industrially practical screwcutting lathe 1800 allowed standardisation screw thread sizes first time paved practical application interchangeability idea already taking hold nuts bolts7
screw threads usually made chipping filing skilled freehand chisels files nuts rare metal screws made usually wood metal bolts passing wood framing metal fastening side usually fastened nonthreaded ways clinching upsetting washer maudslay standardized screw threads used workshop produced sets taps dies would make nuts bolts consistently standards bolt appropriate size would size major advance workshop technology8

national standards bodyedit
19th century differences standards companies making trade increasingly difficult strained instance iron steel dealer recorded displeasure times architects engineers generally specify unnecessarily diverse types sectional material given work anything like economical continuous manufacture becomes impossible country professional agreed upon size weight girder employ given work
engineering standards committee established london 1901 worlds first national standards body1112 subsequently extended standardization work became british engineering standards association 1918 adopting name british standards institution 1931 receiving royal charter 1929 national standards adopted universally throughout country enabled markets rationally efficiently increased level cooperation
first world similar national bodies established countries deutsches institut normung germany 1917 followed counterparts american national standard institute french commission permanente standardisation 19187
international standardsedit
late 19th century efforts made standardize electrical measurement lord kelvin important figure process introducing accurate methods apparatus measuring electricity 1857 introduced series effective instruments including quadrant electrometer cover entire field electrostatic measurement invented current balance also known kelvin balance ampere balance precise specification ampere standard unit electric current13




crompton drew first international standards body international electrotechnical commission 1906


another important figure crompton became concerned large range different standards systems used electrical engineering companies scientists early 20th century many companies entered market 1890s chose settings voltage frequency current even symbols used circuit diagrams adjacent buildings would totally incompatible electrical systems simply fitted different companies crompton could lack efficiency system began consider proposals international standard electric engineering14
1904 crompton represented britain louisiana purchase exposition saint louis part delegation institute electrical engineers presented paper standardisation well received asked look formation commission oversee process15 1906 work complete drew permanent constitution first international standards organization international electrotechnical commission16 body held first meeting year london representatives countries honour contribution electrical standardisation lord kelvin elected bodys first president17

effect firmsedit
primary effect standardization firms basis competition shifted integrated systems individual components within system prior standardization companys product must span entire system individual components different competitors incompatible standardization company focus providing individual component system21 shift toward competition based individual components takes place firms selling tightly integrated systems must quickly shift modular approach supplying companies subsystems components22
effect consumersedit
standardization variety benefits consumers greatest benefits enhanced network effects standards increase compatibility interoperability products allowing information shared within larger network attracting consumers technology enhancing network effects23 benefits standardization consumers reduced uncertainty consumers certain choosing wrong product reduced lockin standard makes likely competing products space24 consumers also benefit able match components system align specific preferences25 initial benefits standardization realized benefits accrue consumers result using standard driven mostly quality technologies underlying standard26
probably greatest downside standardization consumers lack variety guarantee chosen standard meet consumers needs even standard best available option25 another downside standard agreed upon products available market consumers deprived penetration pricing often results rivals competing rapidly increase market share attempt increase likelihood product become standard25 also possible consumer choose product based upon standard fails become dominant27 case consumer spent resources product ultimately less useful result standardization process
