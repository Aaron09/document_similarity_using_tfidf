theoryedit
intention sustainable design eliminate negative environmental impact completely skillful sensitive design1 manifestations sustainable design require renewable resources impact environment minimally connect people natural environment
great design sustainable design rather considering green building design externality architects must think principles great design includes better user experience comfort less enable building easily achieve peak performance maximizing effectives durable quality materials rather wellknown edict “form follows function” it’s time think “form follows environment”
beyond elimination negative environmental impact sustainable design must create projects meaningful innovations shift behaviour dynamic balance economy society intended generate longterm relationships user objectservice finally respectful mindful environmental social differences3

waste preventionedit




plans floriade 2012 venlo netherlands greenest building netherlands external fuel electricity water sewage


negative effects waste
million tonnes waste total generated alone example year6 reference household waste 199192 200708 person england generated average pounds waste day7
experience shown completely safe method waste disposal forms disposal negative impacts environment public health local economies landfills contaminated drinking water garbage burned incinerators poisoned soil water majority water treatment systems change local ecology attempts control manage wastes produced fail eliminate environmental impacts
toxic components household products pose serious health risks aggravate trash problem eight pounds every household garbage contains toxic materials heavy metals like nickel lead cadmium mercury batteries organic compounds found pesticides consumer products freshener sprays nail polish cleaners products8 burned buried toxic materials also pose serious threat public health environment
avoid environmental harm waste prevent generation pollution prevention means changing activities conducted eliminating source problem mean without differently example preventing waste pollution litter caused disposable beverage containers mean without beverages means using refillable bottles
waste prevention strategies planning facilities comprehensive design strategy needed preventing generation solid waste good garbage prevention strategy would require everything brought facility recycled reuse recycled back environment biodegradation would mean greater reliance natural materials products compatible environment
resourcerelated development going basic sources solid waste materials purchased used facility brought facility visitors following waste prevention strategies apply although different approaches needed implementation9

products minimize waste nontoxic
compost anaerobically digest biodegradable wastes
reuse materials onsite collect suitable materials offsite recycling
consuming less resources means creating less waste therefore reduces impact environment

sustainable design principlesedit

practical application varies among disciplines common principles follows

lowimpact materials choose nontoxic sustainably produced recycled materials require little energy process
energy efficiency manufacturing processes produce products require less energy
emotionally durable design reducing consumption waste resources increasing durability relationships people products design
design reuse recycling products processes systems designed performance commercial afterlife10
design impact measures total carbon footprint lifecycle assessment resource used increasingly required available11 many complex give quick accurate wholeearth estimates impacts measure estimates spending consuming average economic share global energy 8000 8400 dollar producing average rate dollar 1995 dollars figures12
sustainable design standards project design guides also increasingly available vigorously developed wide array private organizations individuals also large body methods emerging rapid development become known sustainability science promoted wide variety educational governmental institutions
biomimicry redesigning industrial systems biological lines enabling constant reuse materials continuous closed cycles13
service substitution shifting mode consumption personal ownership products provision services provide similar functions private automobile carsharing service system promotes minimal resource unit consumption trip driven14
renewable resource materials come nearby local bioregional sustainably managed renewable sources composted usefulness exhausted

according jonathan chapman carnegie mellon university emotionally durable design reduces consumption waste natural resources increasing resilience relationships established consumers products25 essentially product replacement delayed strong emotional ties26 book emotionally durable design objects experiences empathy chapman describes process consumption always motivated complex emotional drivers mindless purchasing newer shinier things journey towards ideal desired self cyclical loops desire disappointment becomes seemingly endless process serial destruction27 therefore product requires attribute number attributes extend beyond utilitarianism28
according chapman emotional durability achieved consideration following five elements

narrative users share unique personal history product
consciousness product perceived autonomous possession free
attachment user made feel strong emotional connection product
fiction product inspires interactions connections beyond physical relationship
surface product ages develops character time

strategic approach emotionally durable design provides useful language describe contemporary relevance designing responsible well made tactile products user know assign value longterm29 according hazel clark david brody parsons school design york “emotionally durable design call professionals students alike prioritise relationships design users developing sustainable attitudes design things”30
