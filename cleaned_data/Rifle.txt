rifling remington microgroove rifled barrel






girdled bullet twin rifle groove brunswick rifle mid19th century


origins rifling difficult trace earliest practical experiments seem occurred europe 15th century archers long realized twist added tail feathers arrows gave greater accuracy early muskets produced large quantities smoke soot cleaned action bore musket frequently either action repeated bore scrubbing deliberate attempt create soot grooves would allow shots fired firearm might also perceived increase accuracy although knows sure true rifling dates mid15th centurycitation needed although military commanders preferred smooth bore weapons infantry rifles much prone problems powder fouling barrel took longer reload fire musketscitation needed
rifles created improvement accuracy smooth bore muskets early 18th century benjamin robins english mathematician realized elongated bullet would retain momentum kinetic energy musket ball would slice greater ease1 black powder used early muzzleloading rifles quickly fouled barrel making loading slower difficult greater range also considered little practical since smoke black powder quickly obscured battlefield made almost impossible target enemy distance since musketeers could afford take time stop clean barrels middle battle rifles limited sharpshooters nonmilitary uses like huntingcitation needed
muskets smoothbore large caliber weapons using ballshaped ammunition fired relatively velocity high cost great difficulty precision manufacturing need load readily muzzle musket ball loose barrel consequently firing ball bounced sides barrel fired final direction leaving muzzle unpredictable
performance early muskets defined style warfare time lack accuracy soldiers employed long lines thus line infantry fire opposing forces precise thus necessary opponent muskets used comparatively rapid imprecisely aimed volley fire average soldier could easily trained
territory kentucky early successful rifles long rifle developed course 18th century compared common brown bess tighter bore room bullet barrel still used balls instead conical bullets balls smaller allowing production rounds given amount lead also longer barrels allowing accuracy course rifled helical groove first started appearing sometime 1740 early examples made jacob dickert german immigrant 1850 number manufacturers area longer barrel departure local gunsmiths german roots allowing frontiersmen carry rounds bullets achieve higher speed burning gunpowder contained longer emerging barrel
rifle used precise shooting fire individual targets instead muskets imprecise fire2
time american revolutionary rifles commonly used frontiersmen congress authorized establishment companies riflemen important units morgans riflemen daniel morgan sharpshooting unit eventually proved integral turning british battle saratoga southern states general morgan commanded therefore overall morgans sharpshooters would pick enemy cannoneers officers reducing impact superior british artillery3 kind advantage considered pivotal many battles like battle cowpens saratoga kings mountain kings mountain british officer wrote americans riflemen could anywhere liked pacesat kings mountain destroyed
later napoleonic wars british 95th regiment green jackets 60th regiment royal american well american sharpshooters riflemen 1812 used rifle great effect skirmishing slower loading time musket adopted whole army since rifles used sharpshooters routinely fire mens shoulders long length required avoid forward line shorter length made handier weapon tightfitting balls rammed barrelcitation needed
invention minie balls 1840s solved slow loading problem 1850s 1860s rifles quickly replaced muskets battlefield many rifles often referred rifled muskets similar muskets replaced military also experimented designs breechloading weapons proved much faster rate fire muzzleloaders causing military forces abandon muzzle loaders favor breechloading designs late 1860s later part 19th century rifles generally singleshot breechloading designed aimed discretionary fire individual soldiers rifles stock either fixed folding braced shoulder firing

19th century bullet design also evolved bullets becoming gradually smaller lighter 1910 standard bluntnosed bullet replaced pointed spitzer bullet innovation increased range penetration cartridge design evolved simple paper tubes containing black powder shot sealed brass cases integral primers ignition black powder replaced cordite nitrocellulosebased smokeless powder mixtures propelling bullets higher velocities before6
