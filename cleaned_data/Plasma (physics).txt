historyedit
word plasma comes ancient greek πλάσμα meaning moldable substance1 jelly2 whose usage describes behaviour ionised atomic nuclei electrons within surrounding region plasma simply nuclei suspended movable electrons plasma first identified crookes tube described william crookes 1879 called radiant matter14 nature cathode matter subsequently identified british physicist thomson 189715
term plasma coined irving langmuir 192816 lewi tonks harold mottsmith worked irving langmuir 1920s recall langmuir first used word plasma analogy blood1718 mottsmith recalls particular transport electrons thermionic filaments reminded langmuir “the blood plasma carries white corpuscles germs”19
langmuir described plasma observed follows

except near electrodes sheaths containing electrons ionised contains ions electrons equal numbers resultant space charge small shall name plasma describe region containing balanced charges ions electrons16

notesedit


material undergoes various ‘regimes’ stages saturation breakdown glow transition thermal voltage increased voltagecurrent relationship voltage rises maximum value saturation stage thereafter undergoes fluctuations various stages current progressively increases throughout62
across literature appears strict definition boundary plasma nevertheless enough 2000°c molecules become atomized ionised 3000 state liquid like viscosity atmospheric pressure free electric charges confer relatively high electrical conductivities approach metals63
note nonthermal nonequilibrium plasmas ionised lower energy densities thus temperature dispersed evenly among particles heavy ones remain ‘cold’
