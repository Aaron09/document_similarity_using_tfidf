product liability united statesedit
theories liabilityedit
united states claims commonly associated product liability negligence strict liability breach warranty various consumer protection claims majority product liability laws determined state level vary widely state state2 type product liability claim requires different elements proven present successful claim
types liabilityedit
section restatement third torts products liability distinguishes three major types product liability claims

manufacturing defect
design defect
failure warn also known marketing defects

however states legal claims pleaded terms theories mentioned example plaintiff might plead negligent failure warn strict liability defective design3

manufacturing defects occur manufacturing process usually involve poorquality materials shoddy workmanship
design defects occur product design inherently dangerous useless hence defective matter carefully manufactured demonstrated either showing product fails satisfy ordinary consumer expectations constitutes safe product risks product outweigh benefits4
failuretowarn defects arise products carry inherent nonobvious dangers could mitigated adequate warnings user dangers present regardless well product manufactured designed intended purpose

breach warrantyedit
warranties statements manufacturer seller concerning product commercial transaction warranty claims commonly require privity injured party manufacturer seller plain english means must dealing directly breach warrantybased product liability claims usually focus three types breach express warranty breach implied warranty merchantability breach implied warranty fitness particular purpose additionally claims involving real estate also take form implied warranty habitability express warranty claims focus express statements manufacturer seller concerning product chainsaw useful turkeys various implied warranties cover expectations common products tool unreasonably dangerous used proper purpose unless specifically disclaimed manufacturer seller
strict liabilityedit
rather focus behavior manufacturer negligence strict liability claims focus product strict liability manufacturer liable product defective even manufacturer negligent making product defective
difficulty negligence still requires plaintiff prove defendants conduct fell relevant standard care however entire industry tacitly settles somewhat careless standard conduct analyzed perspective layperson plaintiff able recover even though severely injured although defendants conduct caused injuries conduct negligent legal sense everyone within trade would inevitably testify defendants conduct conformed reasonable tradeperson circumstances practical matter increasing complexity products injuries medical care made many formerly fatal injuries survivable quite difficult expensive task find retain good expert witnesses establish standard care breach causation
therefore 1940s 1950s many american courts departed macpherson standard decided harsh require seriously injured consumer plaintiffs prove negligence claims manufacturers retailers avoid deny plaintiffs relief courts began look facts cases could characterize express implied warranty manufacturer consumer ipsa loquitur doctrine also stretched reduce plaintiffs burden proof time resulting legal fictions became increasingly strained
various states california first throw away fiction warranty boldly assert doctrine strict liability tort defective products supreme court californias decision greenman yuba power products 1963 majority opinion authored thenassociate justice roger traynor importance greenman cannot overstated 1996 association trial lawyers america known american association justice celebrated 50th anniversary polling lawyers professors developments tort past halfcentury greenman topped list5
greenman traynor cited earlier concurring opinion escola cocacola bottling 1944 traynor concurring escola widely recognized landmark case american law6 justice traynor laid foundation greenman words

even negligence however public policy demands responsibility fixed wherever effectively reduce hazards life health inherent defective products reach market evident manufacturer anticipate hazards guard recurrence others public cannot suffer injury defective products unprepared meet consequences cost injury loss time health overwhelming misfortune person injured needless risk injury insured manufacturer distributed among public cost business public interest discourage marketing products defects menace public products nevertheless find market public interest place responsibility whatever injury cause upon manufacturer even negligent manufacture product responsible reaching market however intermittently injuries occur however haphazardly strike risk occurrence constant risk general risk general constant protection manufacturer best situated afford protection

year greenman supreme court california proceeded extend strict liability parties involved manufacturing distribution sale defective products including retailers7 1969 made clear defendants liable direct customers users also innocent bystanders randomly injured defective products8
since many jurisdictions swayed justice traynors arguments behalf strict liability rule escola greenman subsequent cases years greenman highest courts nearly states territories followed californias example imposing strict liability manufacturers distributors retailers defective products landmark 1986 decision supreme court embraced strict liability defective products adopting part federal admiralty law9
meanwhile although greenman rule transmitted states section 402a restatement torts second published 1964 greenman supreme court california refused adopt section 402as unreasonably dangerous limitation upon strict liability 197210 thus strict liability california truly strict plaintiff need show defect unreasonable dangerous hand california defendant allowed introduce evidence strict products liability action plaintiff contributed injuries11
although supreme court california since become conservative continues endorse expand doctrine 2002 held strict liability defective products even applies makers component products installed sold part real property12 however strict liability limitless 2012 court held manufacturers liable strict liability negligence defects products distinguished products could potentially used products13
consumer protectionedit
addition common claims many states enacted consumer protection statutes providing specific remedies variety product defects statutory remedies often provided defects merely render product unusable hence cause economic injury cause physical injury damage property economic loss rule means strict liability generally unavailable products damage best known examples consumer protection laws product defects lemon laws became widespread automobiles often american citizens secondlargest investment buying home
product liability outside united statesedit
rest world legislatures took lead imposing strict liability defective products judiciaries several countries rejected attempts creative lawyers persuade adopt greenman holding including canada south africacitation needed
europe movement towards strict liability began council europe convention products liability regard personal injury death strasbourg convention 197714 july 1985 european economic community adopted product liability directive language similar traynors directive stated liability without fault part producer sole means adequately solving problem peculiar increasing technicality fair apportionment risks inherent modern technological production however directive also gave member state option imposing liability million euros defect directive imposed strict liability upon manufacturers importers deviated significantly model refusing impose strict liability purely domestic distributors retailers
legislatures many countries outside subsequently enacted strict liability regimes based european model generally applying manufacturers importers including israel march 1980 based early proposed draft directive brazil september 1990 peru november 1991 australia july 1992 russia february 1992 switzerland december 1992 argentina october 1993 japan june 1994 taiwan june 1994 malaysia august 1999 south korea january 2000 thailand december 2007 south africa april 2009citation needed
china first enacted product quality october 1993 attempt impose strict liability badly drafted quite weak numerous product scandals throughout 2000s china finally enacted much stronger tort liability december 2009 followed statute choice substantive foreignrelated civil relationships april 2011 enables chinese consumers injured foreignmade products request chinese courts apply defendants place businesscitation needed laws still relatively ineffective large chinese manufacturers stateowned enterprises defendant simply product defect declared state secret plaintiff prosecuted revealing state secrets enable chinese consumers seek compensation nonstate companies well foreign manufacturerscitation needed
