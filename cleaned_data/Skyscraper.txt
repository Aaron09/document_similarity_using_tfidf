modern skyscrapers downtown angeles


design construction skyscrapers involves creating safe habitable spaces tall buildings buildings must support weight resist wind earthquakes protect occupants fire must also conveniently accessible even upper floors provide utilities comfortable climate occupants problems posed skyscraper design considered among complex encountered given balances required economics engineering construction management
common feature skyscrapers steel framework curtain walls suspended rather loadbearing walls conventional construction skyscrapers steel frame enables built taller typical loadbearing walls reinforced concrete skyscrapers usually particularly small surface area conventionally thought walls walls loadbearing skyscrapers characterized surface areas windows made possible concept steel frame curtain wall however skyscrapers also curtain walls mimick conventional walls small surface area windows
concept skyscraper product industrialized made possible cheap fossil fuel derived energy industrially refined materials steel concrete construction skyscrapers enabled steel frame construction surpassed brick mortar construction starting 19th century finally surpassing 20th century together reinforced concrete construction price steel decreased labour costs increased
steel frames become inefficient uneconomic supertall buildings usable floor space reduced progressively larger supporting columns52 since 1960 tubular designs used high rises reduces usage material efficient economic terms willis tower uses third less steel empire state building allows greater height allows fewer interior columns creates usable floor space enables buildings take various shapes
elevators characteristic skyscrapers 1852 elisha otis introduced safety elevator allowing convenient safe passenger movement upper floors another crucial development steel frame instead stone brick otherwise walls lower floors tall building would thick practical today major manufacturers elevators include otis thyssenkrupp schindler kone
advances construction techniques allowed skyscrapers narrow width increasing height techniques include mass dampers reduce vibrations swaying gaps allow pass reducing wind shear53
basic design considerationsedit
good structural design important building design particularly skyscrapers since even small chance catastrophic failure unacceptable given high price presents paradox civil engineers assure lack failure test modes failure laboratory real world know modes failure learn previous failures thus engineer absolutely sure given structure resist loadings could cause failure large enough margins safety failure acceptably unlikely buildings fail engineers question whether failure lack foresight unknowable factor
loading vibrationedit
load skyscraper experiences largely force building material building designs weight structure much larger weight material support beyond weight technical terms dead load load structure larger live load weight things structure people furniture vehicles amount structural material required within lower levels skyscraper much larger material required within higher levels always visually apparent empire state buildings setbacks actually result building code time 1916 zoning resolution structurally required hand john hancock centers shape uniquely result supports loads vertical supports come several types among common skyscrapers categorized steel frames concrete cores tube within tube design shear walls
wind loading skyscraper also considerable fact lateral wind load imposed supertall structures generally governing factor structural design wind pressure increases height tall buildings loads associated wind larger dead live loads
vertical horizontal loading factors come varied unpredictable sources earthquakes
steel frameedit
1895 steel replaced cast iron skyscrapers structural material malleability allowed formed variety shapes could riveted ensuring strong connections54 simplicity steel frame eliminated inefficient part shear wall central portion consolidated support members much stronger fashion allowing horizontal vertical supports throughout among steels drawbacks material must supported height increases distance supporting members must decrease turn increases amount material must supported becomes inefficient uneconomic buildings stories tall usable floor spaces reduced supporting column usage steel52
tube structural systemsedit

willis tower chicago showing bundled tube frame design


structural system framed tubes developed 1963 fazlur khan rankine defined framed tube structure three dimensional space structure composed three four possibly frames braced frames shear walls joined near edges form vertical tubelike structural system capable resisting lateral forces direction cantilevering foundation55 closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form tube horizontal loads primarily wind supported structure whole framed tubes allow fewer interior columns create usable floor space half exterior surface available windows larger openings like garage doors required tube frame must interrupted transfer girders used maintain structural integrity tube structures costs time allowing buildings reach greater heights concrete tubeframe construction39 first used dewittchestnut apartment building completed chicago 196356 soon john hancock center world trade center

trussed tube xbracingedit




changes structure height tubular systems fundamental super tall buildings


khan pioneered several variations tube structure designcitation needed concept xbracing trussed tube first employed john hancock center concept reduced lateral load building transferring load exterior columns allows reduced need interior columns thus creating floor space concept seen john hancock center designed 1965 completed 1969 famous buildings structural expressionist style skyscrapers distinctive xbracing exterior actually hint structures skin indeed part tubular system idea architectural techniques building used climb record heights tubular system essentially spine helps building stand upright wind earthquake loads xbracing allows higher performance tall structures ability open inside floorplan usable floor space architect desires
john hancock center efficient earlier steelframe structures empire state building 1931 required kilograms steel square metre chase manhattan bank building 1961 required john hancock center required 14540 trussed tube concept applied many later skyscrapers including onterie center citigroup center bank china tower58
bundled tubeedit
important variation tube frame bundled tube uses several interconnected tube frames willis tower chicago used design employing nine tubes varying height achieve distinct appearance bundled tube structure meant buildings longer need boxlike appearance could become sculpture41
elevator conundrumedit
invention elevator precondition invention skyscrapers given people would could climb flights stairs time elevators skyscraper simply necessary utility like running water electricity fact closely related design whole structure taller building requires elevators service additional floors elevator shafts consume valuable floor space service core contains elevator shafts becomes reduce profitability building architects must therefore balance value gained adding height value lost expanding service core59
many tall buildings elevators nonstandard configuration reduce footprint buildings former world trade center towers chicagos john hancock center lobbies express elevators take passengers upper floors serve base local elevators allows architects engineers place elevator shafts saving space lobbies express elevators take significant amount space however amount time spent commuting floors
buildings petronas towers doubledeck elevators allowing people single elevator reaching floors every stop possible even levels elevator although never done main problem doubledeck elevators cause everyone elevator stop people level need given floor
buildings lobbies include world trade center petronas twin towers taipei 44thfloor lobby john hancock center also featured first highrise indoor swimming pool remains highest america60
economic rationaleedit
skyscrapers usually situated city centers price land high constructing skyscraper becomes justified price land high makes economic sense build upwards minimize cost land total floor area building thus construction skyscrapers dictated economics results skyscrapers certain part large city unless building code restricts height buildings
skyscrapers rarely seen small cities characteristic large cities critical importance high land prices construction skyscrapers usually office commercial hotel users afford rents city center thus tenants skyscrapers classes skyscrapers built areas bedrock near surface makes constructing foundation cheaper example case midtown manhattan lower manhattan york city inbetween parts city
