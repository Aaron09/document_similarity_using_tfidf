definitionedit
exact definition taxonomy varies source source core discipline remains conception naming classification groups organisms1 points reference recent definitions taxonomy presented

theory practice grouping individuals species arranging species larger groups giving groups names thus producing classification2
field science major component systematics encompasses description identification nomenclature classification3
science classification biology arrangement organisms classification4
science classification applied living organisms including study means formation species etc5
analysis organisms characteristics purpose classification6
systematics studies phylogeny provide pattern translated classification names inclusive field taxonomy listed desirable unusual definition7

varied definitions either place taxonomy subarea systematics definition invert relationship definition appear consider terms synonymous disagreement whether biological nomenclature considered part taxonomy definitions part systematics outside taxonomy8 example definition paired following definition systematics places nomenclature outside taxonomy6

systematics study identification taxonomy nomenclature organisms including classification living things regard natural relationships study variation evolution taxa

whole terms including taxonomy systematic biology systematics biosystematics scientific classification biological classification phylogenetics times overlapping meanings sometimes sometimes slightly different always related intersecting19 broadest meaning taxonomy used term introduced 1813 candolle théorie élémentaire botanique10
alpha beta taxonomyedit
confused alpha diversity
term alpha taxonomy primarily used today refer discipline finding describing naming taxa particularly species11 earlier literature term different meaning referring morphological taxonomy products research 19th century12
william bertram turrill introduced term alpha taxonomy series papers published 1935 1937 discussed philosophy possible future directions discipline taxonomy13

increasing desire amongst taxonomists consider problems wider viewpoints investigate possibilities closer cooperation cytological ecological genetical colleagues acknowledge revision expansion perhaps drastic nature aims methods desirable turrill 1935 suggested accepting older invaluable taxonomy based structure conveniently designated alpha possible glimpse fardistant taxonomy built upon wide basis morphological physiological facts possible place found observational experimental data relating even indirectly constitution subdivision origin behaviour species taxonomic groups ideals said never completely realized however great value acting permanent stimulants even vague ideal omega taxonomy progress little greek alphabet please thinking groping beta taxonomy13

turrill thus explicitly excludes alpha taxonomy various areas study includes within taxonomy whole ecology physiology genetics cytology excludes phylogenetic reconstruction alpha taxonomy 365–366
later authors used term different sense mean delimitation species subspecies taxa ranks using whatever investigative techniques available including sophisticated computational laboratory techniques1411 thus ernst mayr 1968 defined beta taxonomy classification ranks higher species15

understanding biological meaning variation evolutionary origin groups related species even important second stage taxonomic activity sorting species groups relatives taxa arrangement hierarchy higher categories activity term classification denotes also referred beta taxonomy

microtaxonomy macrotaxonomyedit

initial description taxon involves five main requirements68

taxon must given name based letters latin alphabet binomial species uninomial ranks
name must unique homonym
description must based least namebearing type specimen
include statements appropriate attributes either describe define taxon differentiate taxa diagnosis iczn code article 1311 article codes deliberately separate defining content taxon circumscription defining name
