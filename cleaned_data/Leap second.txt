scheduling leap seconds initially delegated bureau international lheure passed international earth rotation reference systems service iers january 1988 iers usually decides apply leap second whenever difference approaches order keep difference exceeding

main reason slowing earths rotation tidal friction alone would lengthen mscentury15 contributing factors movement earths crust relative core changes mantle convection events processes cause significant redistribution mass processes change earths moment inertia affecting rate rotation conservation angular momentum redistributions increase earths rotational speed shorten solar oppose tidal friction example glacial rebound shortens solar mscentury 2004 indian ocean earthquake thought shortened microseconds21 evident figure earths rotation slowed decreasing rate since initiation current system 1971 rate leap second insertions therefore decreasing
