defining characteristic platform absence centralized control gaming platforms except android devices extent owned administered single group
advantages openness include

reduced software cost
prices kept competition absence platformholder fees games services cheaper every level many free5960
increased flexibility
games decades played modern systems emulation software need be61 conversely newer games often older systems reducing games fidelity andor scale
increased innovation
need permission release update game modify existing platforms hardware software constantly evolving factors make centre hardware software innovation comparison closed platforms tend remain much throughout lifespan262

also disadvantages including

increased complexity
generalpurpose tool inner workings exposed owner misconfiguration create enormous problems hardware compatibility issues also possible game development complicated wide variety hardware configurations developers forced limit design suboptimum hardware order reach larger market range graphical settings adjust playability individual machines requiring increased development test customer support resourcescitation needed
increased hardware cost
components generally sold individually profit even buys prebuilt machine whereas hardware closed platforms massproduced single unit often sold smaller profit even loss intention making profit instead online service fees developer profits60
reduced security
difficult situations ultimately impossible control hardware software used leads software piracy cheating closed platforms suffer from63
