lymphatic system


lymphatic system consists lymphatic organs conducting network lymphatic vessels circulating lymph
primary central lymphoid organs generate lymphocytes immature progenitor cells
thymus bone marrow constitute primary lymphoid organs involved production early clonal selection lymphocyte tissues bone marrow responsible creation cells production maturation cells bone marrow cells immediately join circulatory system travel secondary lymphoid organs search pathogens cells hand travel bone marrow thymus develop mature cells join cells search pathogens cells begin process apoptosis form programmed cell death
secondary peripheral lymphoid organs include lymph nodes spleen maintain mature naive lymphocytes initiate adaptive immune response peripheral lymphoid organs sites lymphocyte activation antigens activation leads clonal expansion affinity maturation mature lymphocytes recirculate blood peripheral lymphoid organs encounter specific antigen
secondary lymphoid tissue provides environment foreign altered native molecules antigens interact lymphocytes exemplified lymph nodes lymphoid follicles tonsils peyers patches spleen adenoids skin associated mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue malt
gastrointestinal wall appendix mucosa resembling colon heavily infiltrated lymphocytes
tertiary lymphoid tissueclarification needed typically contains fewer lymphocytes assumes immune role challenged antigens result inflammation achieves importing lymphocytes blood lymph6

lymphoid tissueedit
thymusedit
main article thymus
thymus primary lymphoid organ site maturation cells lymphocytes adaptive immune system thymus increases size birth response postnatal antigen stimulation puberty regresses thereafter7 loss lack thymus results severe immunodeficiency subsequent high susceptibility infection7 species thymus consists lobules divided septa made epithelium therefore epithelial organ cells mature thymocytes proliferate undergo selection process thymic cortex entering medulla interact epithelial cells
thymus provides inductive environment development cells hematopoietic progenitor cells addition thymic stromal cells allow selection functional selftolerant cell repertoire therefore important roles thymus induction central tolerance
thymus largest active neonatal preadolescent periods early teens thymus begins atrophy thymic stroma mostly replaced adipose tissue nevertheless residual lymphopoiesis continues throughout adult life
spleenedit
main article spleen
main functions spleen

produce immune cells fight antigens
remove particulate matter aged blood cells mainly erythrocytes
produce blood cells fetal life

spleen synthesizes antibodies white pulp removes antibodycoated bacteria antibodycoated blood cells blood lymph node circulation study published 2009 using mice found spleen contains reserve half bodys monocytes within pulp8 monocytes upon moving injured tissue heart turn dendritic cells macrophages promoting tissue healing8910 spleen center activity mononuclear phagocyte system considered analogous large lymph node absence causes predisposition certain infections
like thymus spleen efferent lymphatic vessels short gastric arteries splenic artery supply blood11
germinal centers supplied arterioles called penicilliary radicles12
fifth month prenatal development spleen creates blood cells birth bone marrow solely responsible hematopoiesis major lymphoid organ central player reticuloendothelial system spleen retains ability produce lymphocytes spleen stores blood cells lymphocytes store enough blood cells help emergency lymphocytes stored time13

lymph capillaries tissue spaces


lymphatic vessels also called lymph vessels conduct lymph different parts body include tubular vessels lymph capillaries larger collecting vessels–the right lymphatic duct thoracic duct left lymphatic duct lymph capillaries mainly responsible absorption interstitial fluid tissues lymph vessels propel absorbed fluid forward larger collecting ducts ultimately returns bloodstream subclavian veins vessels also called lymphatic channels simply lymphatics17
lymphatics responsible maintaining balance body fluids network capillaries collecting lymphatic vessels work efficiently drain transport extravasated fluid along proteins antigens back circulatory system numerous intraluminal valves vessels ensure unidirectional flow lymph without reflux18 valve systems used achieve directional flow—a primary secondary valve system19 capillaries blindended valves ends capillaries specialised junctions together anchoring filaments allow unidirectional flow primary vessels collecting lymphatics however propel lymph combined actions intraluminal valves lymphatic muscle cells20

historyedit
hippocrates century first people mention lymphatic system work joints briefly mentioned lymph nodes sentence rufus ephesus roman physician identified axillary inguinal mesenteric lymph nodes well thymus century ad26 first mention lymphatic vessels century herophilos greek anatomist living alexandria incorrectly concluded absorptive veins lymphatics meant lacteals lymph vessels intestines drained hepatic portal veins thus liver26 findings ruphus herophilos propagated greek physician galen described lacteals mesenteric lymph nodes observed dissection apes pigs century ad2627
16th century gabriele falloppio discoverer fallopian tubes described known lacteals coursing intestines full yellow matter26 1563 bartolomeo eustachi professor anatomy described thoracic duct horses vena alba thoracis26 next breakthrough came 1622 physician gaspare aselli identified lymphatic vessels intestines dogs termed venae alba lacteae known simply lacteals lacteals termed fourth kind vessels three artery vein nerve believed type vessel disproved galens assertion chyle carried veins still believed lacteals carried chyle liver taught galen28 also identified thoracic duct failed notice connection lacteals26 connection established jean pecquet 1651 found white fluid mixing blood dogs heart suspected fluid chyle flow increased abdominal pressure applied traced fluid thoracic duct followed chylefilled called chyli receptaculum known cisternae chyli investigations find lacteals contents enter venous system thoracic duct2628 thus proven convincingly lacteals terminate liver thus disproving galens second idea chyle flowed liver28 johann veslingius drew earliest sketches lacteals humans 164727
idea blood recirculates body rather produced anew liver heart first accepted result works william harvey—a work published 1628 1652 olaus rudbeck 1630–1702 swede discovered certain transparent vessels liver contained clear fluid white thus named hepaticoaqueous vessels also learned emptied thoracic duct valves28 announced findings court queen christina sweden publish findings year29 interim similar findings published thomas bartholin additionally published vessels present everywhere body liver also named lymphatic vessels28 resulted bitter dispute bartholins pupils martin bogdan30 rudbeck accused plagiarism29
galens ideas prevailed medicine 17th century thought blood produced liver chyle contaminated ailments intestine stomach various spirits added organs blood consumed organs body theory required blood consumed produced many times even 17th century ideas defended physicians27
