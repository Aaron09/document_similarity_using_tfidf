lava composition
another classifying volcanoes composition material erupted lava since affects shape volcano lava broadly classified four different compositions

erupted magma contains high percentage silica lava called felsic

felsic lavas dacites rhyolites tend highly viscous fluid erupted domes short stubby flows viscous lavas tend form stratovolcanoes lava domes lassen peak california example volcano formed felsic lava actually large lava dome
siliceous magmas viscous tend trap volatiles gases present cause magma erupt catastrophically eventually forming stratovolcanoes pyroclastic flows ignimbrites highly hazardous products volcanoes since composed molten volcanic heavy atmosphere volcanos slopes travel vents large eruptions temperatures high 1200 known occur pyroclastic flows incinerate everything flammable path thick layers pyroclastic flow deposits laid often many meters thick alaskas valley thousand smokes formed eruption novarupta near katmai 1912 example thick pyroclastic flow ignimbrite deposit volcanic light enough erupted high earths atmosphere travel many kilometres falls back ground tuff


erupted magma contains 52–63 silica lava intermediate composition

erupted magmas contain silica produce ultramafic lava ultramafic flows also known komatiites rare indeed erupted earths surface since proterozoic planets heat flow higher hottest lavas probably fluid common mafic lavas

lava texture
types lava named according surface texture ʻaʻa pronounced ˈʔaʔa pāhoehoe paːˈhoeˈhoe hawaiian words ʻaʻa characterized rough clinkery surface typical texture viscous lava flows however even basaltic mafic flows erupted ʻaʻa flows particularly eruption rate high slope steep
pāhoehoe characterized smooth often ropey wrinkly surface generally formed fluid lava flows usually mafic flows erupt pāhoehoe since often erupt higher temperatures proper chemical makeup allow flow greater fluidity
