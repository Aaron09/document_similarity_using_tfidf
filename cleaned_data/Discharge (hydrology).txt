catchment dischargeedit
catchment river certain location determined surface area land drains toward river point rivers discharge location depends rainfall catchment drainage area inflow outflow groundwater area stream modifications dams irrigation diversions well evaporation evapotranspiration areas land plant surfaces storm hydrology important consideration streams discharge hydrograph record discharge varies time precipitation event stream rises peak flow precipitation event falls slow recession peak flow also corresponds maximum water level reached event interest flood studies analysis relationship precipitation intensity duration response stream discharge aided concept unit hydrograph represents response stream discharge time application hypothetical unit amount duration rainfall half inch hour amount precipitation correlates volume water depending area catchment subsequently flows river using unit hydrograph method actual historical rainfalls modeled mathematically confirm characteristics historical floods hypothetical design storms created comparison observed stream responses
