vaccines cause immune system react body actually infected general infection symptoms many cold symptoms general infection symptoms appear though symptoms usually severe longlasting influenza dangerous adverse effect severe allergic reaction either virus material residues eggs used grow influenza however reactions extremely rare109
costeffectiveness seasonal influenza vaccination widely evaluated different groups different settings110 generally found costeffective intervention especially children111 elderly112 however results economic evaluations influenza vaccination often found dependent assumptions113114
infection control
information influenza prevention
reasonably effective ways reduce transmission influenza include good personal health hygiene habits touching eyes nose mouth115 frequent hand washing soap water alcoholbased hand rubs116 covering coughs sneezes avoiding close contact sick people staying home sick avoiding spitting also recommended117 although face masks might help prevent transmission caring sick118119 mixed evidence beneficial effects community117120 smoking raises risk contracting influenza well producing severe disease symptoms121122
since influenza spreads aerosols contact contaminated surfaces surface sanitizing help prevent infections123 alcohol effective sanitizer influenza viruses quaternary ammonium compounds used alcohol sanitizing effect lasts longer124 hospitals quaternary ammonium compounds bleach used sanitize rooms equipment occupied patients influenza symptoms124 home done effectively diluted chlorine bleach125
social distancing strategies used past pandemics closing schools churches theaters slowed spread virus large effect overall death rate126127 uncertain reducing public gatherings example closing schools workplaces reduce transmission since people influenza moved area another measures would also difficult enforce might unpopular117 small numbers people infected isolating sick might reduce risk transmission117

prognosis
influenzas effects much severe last longer common cold people recover completely weeks others develop lifethreatening complications pneumonia thus influenza deadly especially weak young chronically ill60 people weak immune system people advanced infection transplant patients whose immune systems medically suppressed prevent transplant organ rejection suffer particularly severe disease139 pregnant women young children also high risk complications140
worsen chronic health problems people emphysema chronic bronchitis asthma experience shortness breath influenza cause worsening coronary heart disease congestive heart failure141 smoking another risk factor associated serious disease increased mortality influenza142

seasonal variations
information season




seasonal risk areas influenza november–april blue april–november yearround yellow


influenza reaches peak prevalence winter northern southern hemispheres winter different times year actually different seasons year world health organization assisted national influenza centers makes recommendations different vaccine formulations every year northern southern hemisphere106
longstanding puzzle outbreaks occur seasonally rather uniformly throughout year possible explanation people indoors often winter close contact often promotes transmission person person increased travel northern hemisphere winter holiday season also play role150 another factor cold temperatures lead drier dehydrate mucus particles particles lighter thus remain airborne longer periodthe virus also survives longer surfaces colder temperatures aerosol transmission virus highest cold environments less relative humidity151 lower humidity winter seems main cause seasonal influenza transmission temperate regions152153
however seasonal changes infection rates also occur tropical regions countries peaks infection seen mainly rainy season154 seasonal changes contact rates school terms major factor childhood diseases measles pertussis also play role combination small seasonal effects amplified dynamical resonance endogenous disease cycles155 h5n1 exhibits seasonality humans birds156
alternative hypothesis explain seasonality influenza infections effect vitamin levels immunity virus157 idea first proposed robert edgar hopesimpson 1965158 proposed cause influenza epidemics winter connected seasonal fluctuations vitamin produced skin influence solar artificial radiation could explain influenza occurs mostly winter tropical rainy season people stay indoors away vitamin levels fall

antigenic shift reassortment result novel highly pathogenic strains human influenza


influenza viruses constantly evolving mutation reassortment42 mutations cause small changes hemagglutinin neuraminidase antigens surface virus called antigenic drift slowly creates increasing variety strains evolves infect people immune preexisting strains variant replaces older strains rapidly sweeps human population often causing epidemic166 however since strains produced drift still reasonably similar older strains people still immune contrast influenza viruses reassort acquire completely antigens—for example reassortment avian strains human strains called antigenic shift human influenza virus produced entirely antigens everybody susceptible novel influenza spread uncontrollably causing pandemic167 contrast model pandemics based antigenic drift shift alternative approach proposed periodic pandemics produced interactions fixed viral strains human population constantly changing immunities different viral strains168




generation time influenza time infection next short days explains influenza epidemics start finish short time scale months169


public health point view epidemics spread rapidly difficult control influenza virus strains infectious infected individual infect individuals basic reproduction number influenza generally around however generation time influenza extremely short time person becoming infected infects next person days short generation time means influenza epidemics generally peak around months burn months decision intervene influenza epidemic therefore taken early decision therefore often made back incomplete data another problem individuals become infectious become symptomatic means putting people quarantine become effective public health intervention169 average person viral shedding tends peak whereas symptoms peak three14
