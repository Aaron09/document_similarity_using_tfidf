stakeholders concerned communitiesedit

roughly gold open access journals author fees cover cost publishing plos fees vary 1495 290071 instead reader subscription fees advertising revenue andor funding foundations institutions also used provide funding
selfarchiving green open accessedit
main article selfarchiving
selfarchiving also known green open access refers practice depositing articles open access repository institutional disciplinary repository arxiv

policies mandatesedit
main article open access mandate

many universities research institutions research funders adopted mandates requiring researchers provide open access peerreviewed research articles selfarchiving open access repository82 publishers publisher associations lobbied introducing mandates838485

funding issuesedit
also open access journal financing
article processing charges often used open access journals shift burden payment readers authors funders creates concerns15 concern publisher makes profit accepting papers incentive accept anything submitted rather selecting rejecting articles based quality could remedied however charging peerreview rather acceptance90 another concern institutional budgets need adjusted order provide funding article processing charges required publish many open access journals published biomed central91 argued reduce ability publish research results lack sufficient funds leading research becoming part public record92
unless discounts available authors countries incomes external funding provided cover cost article processing charges could exclude authors developing countries less wellfunded research fields publishing open access journals however traditional model prohibitive costs nonopen access journal subscriptions already place heavy burden research community green open access selfarchiving eventually makes subscriptions unsustainable cancelled subscription savings gold open access publishing costs without need divert extra money research93 moreover many open access publishers offer discounts publishing waivers authors developing countries suffering financial hardship selfarchiving nonopen access publications provides cost alternative model94
another concern redirection money major funding agencies national institutes health wellcome trust direct support research support open access publication robert terry senior policy advisor wellcome trust said feels research budget change creation knowledge dissemination knowledge95
research institutions could cover cost open access converting open access journal costrecovery model institutions annual tool access subscription savings available cover annual open access publication costs96 2017 study planck society annual turnovers academic publishers amount approximately billion argued money comes predominantly publicly funded scientific libraries purchase subscriptions licenses order provide access scientific journals members study presented planck digital library found subscription budgets would sufficient fund open access publication charges97
