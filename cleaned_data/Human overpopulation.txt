significant increases human population occur whenever birth rate exceeds death rate extended periods time traditionally fertility rate strongly influenced cultural social norms rather stable therefore slow adapt changes social technological environmental conditions example death rates fell 19th 20th century result improved sanitation child immunizations advances medicine allowing newborns survive fertility rate adjust downward resulting significant population growth 1700s seven children died reaching reproductive age84 today nine children born industrialized nations reach adulthoodcitation needed

egypt announced program reduce overpopulation family planning education putting women workforce announced june 2008 minister health population government aside million egyptian pounds million program281
several scientists including paul anne ehrlich gretchen daily proposed humanity work stabilizing absolute numbers starting point towards beginning process reducing total numbers suggested following solutions policies following smallfamilysize socioculturalbehavioral norm worldwide especially onechildperfamily ethos providing contraception along proper education benefits providing access safe legal abortion backup contraception combined significantly equitable distribution resources globally282283
business magnate turner proposed voluntary nonimposed onechildperfamily cultural norm pledge fewer campaign population matters population concern organisation people encouraged limit small family size
population planning intended reduce population size growth rate promote enforce following practices although methods well

greater better access contraception
reducing infant mortality parents need many children ensure least survive adulthood284
improving status women order facilitate departure traditional sexual division labour
onechild twochild policies policies restricting discouraging births directly
family planning285
creating small family role models285

urban designer michael arth proposed choicebased marketable birth license plan calls birth credits288 birth credits would allow woman many children wants long buys license children beyond average allotment would result zero population growth allotment determined child example first child would free market would determine license additional child would cost extra credits would expire certain time credits could hoarded speculators actual cost credits would fraction actual cost raising child credits would serve wakeup call women might otherwise produce children without seriously considering long term consequences society289







another choicebased approach similar arths birth credits financial compensation benefits free goods andor services state stateowned companies offered people voluntarily undergo sterilization compensation offered past government india290
