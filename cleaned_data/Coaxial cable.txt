signal leakageedit
signal leakage passage electromagnetic fields shield cable occurs directions ingress passage outside signal cable result noise disruption desired signal egress passage signal intended remain within cable outside world result weaker signal cable radio frequency interference nearby devices severe leakage usually results improperly installed connectors faults cable shield
example united states signal leakage cable television systems regulated since cable signals frequencies aeronautical radionavigation bands catv operators also choose monitor networks leakage prevent ingress outside signals entering cable cause unwanted noise picture ghosting excessive noise overwhelm signal making useless
ideal shield would perfect conductor holes gaps bumps connected perfect ground however smooth solid highly conductive shield would heavy inflexible expensive coax used straight line feeds commercial radio broadcast towers economical cables must make compromises shield efficacy flexibility cost corrugated surface flexible hardline flexible braid foil shields since shields cannot perfect conductors current flowing inside shield produces electromagnetic field outer surface shield
consider skin effect magnitude alternating current conductor decays exponentially distance beneath surface depth penetration proportional square root resistivity means shield finite thickness small amount current still flowing opposite surface conductor perfect conductor zero resistivity current would flow surface penetration conductor real cables shield made imperfect although usually good conductor must always leakage
gaps holes allow electromagnetic field penetrate side example braided shields many small gaps gaps smaller using foil solid metal shield still seam running length cable foil becomes increasingly rigid increasing thickness thin foil layer often surrounded layer braided metal offers greater flexibility given crosssection

noiseedit
external fields create voltage across inductance outside outer conductor sender receiver effect less several parallel cables reduces inductance therefore voltage outer conductor carries reference potential signal inner conductor receiving circuit measures wrong voltage
transformer effectedit
transformer effect sometimes used mitigate effect currents induced shield inner outer conductors form primary secondary winding transformer effect enhanced highquality cables outer layer mumetal transformer aforementioned voltage across outer conductor transformed onto inner conductor voltages cancelled receiver many sender receivers means reduce leakage even increase transformer effect passing whole cable ferrite core times
common mode current radiationedit
common mode current occurs stray currents shield flow direction current center conductor causing coax radiate
shield effect coax results opposing currents center conductor shield creating opposite magnetic fields cancel thus radiate effect helps ladder line however ladder line extremely sensitive surrounding metal objects enter fields completely cancel coax problem since field enclosed shield however still possible field form shield connected objects antenna coax feeds current formed field antenna coax shield would flow direction current center conductor thus canceled energy would radiate coax affecting radiation pattern antenna sufficient power could hazard people near cable properly placed properly sized balun prevent common mode radiation coax isolating transformer blocking capacitor used couple coaxial cable equipment desirable pass radiofrequency signals block direct current lowfrequency power
