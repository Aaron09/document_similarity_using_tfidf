tilapia aquaculture shown contain much higher ratio omega6 omega3 oils
impacts wild fishedit
carnivorous omnivorous farmed fish species wild forage fish although carnivorous farmed fish represented percent aquaculture production weight 2000 represented percent aquaculture production value85
farming carnivorous species like salmon shrimp leads high demand forage fish match nutrition wild fish actually produce omega3 fatty acids instead accumulate either consuming microalgae produce fatty acids case forage fish like herring sardines case fatty predatory fish like salmon eating prey fish accumulated omega3 fatty acids microalgae satisfy requirement percent world fish production farmed salmon86

pollution cage aquacultureedit
salmon farms typically sited pristine coastal ecosystems pollute farm 200000 salmon discharges fecal waste city 60000 people waste discharged directly surrounding aquatic environment untreated often containing antibiotics pesticides8 also accumulation heavy metals benthos seafloor near salmon farms particularly copper zinc100
2016 mass fish kill events impacted salmon farmers along chiles coast wider ecology101 increases aquaculture production associated effluent considered possible contributing factors fish molluscan mortality102
cage aquaculture responsible nutrient enrichment waters established results fish wastes uneaten feed inputs elements concern nitrogen phosphorus promote algal growth including harmful algal blooms toxic fish flushing times current speeds distance shore water depth important considerations locating cages order minimize impacts nutrient enrichment coastal ecosystems
extent effects pollution seacage aquaculture varies depending cages located species kept densely cages stocked fish important speciesspecific variables include species food conversion ratio nitrogen retention studies prior 2001 determined amount nitrogen introduced feed lost water column seafloor waste varies 95citation needed

surprisingly disease parasitism major effect fish welfare important farmers manage infected stock also apply disease prevention measures however prevention methods vaccination also induce stress extra handling injection112 methods include adding antibiotics feed adding chemicals water treatment baths biological control using cleaner wrasse remove lice farmed salmon112
many steps involved transport including capture food deprivation reduce faecal contamination transport water transfer transport vehicle nets pumps plus transport transfer delivery location transport water needs maintained high quality regulated temperature sufficient oxygen minimal waste products110112 cases anaesthetics used small doses calm fish transport112
