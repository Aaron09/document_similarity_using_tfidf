effect typical checksum function unix cksum utility


checksum smallsized datum derived block digital data purpose detecting errors introduced transmission storage usually applied installation file received download server checksums often used verify data integrity relied upon verify data authenticity
actual procedure yields checksum data input called checksum function checksum algorithm depending design goals good checksum algorithm usually output significantly different value even small changes made input especially true cryptographic hash functions used detect many data corruption errors verify overall data integrity computed checksum current data input matches stored value previously computed checksum high probability data accidentally altered corrupted
checksum functions related hash functions fingerprints randomization functions cryptographic hash functions however concepts different applications therefore different design goals instance function returning start string provide hash appropriate applications never suitable checksum checksums used cryptographic primitives larger authentication algorithms cryptographic systems specific design goals hmac
check digits parity bits special cases checksums appropriate small blocks data social security numbers bank account numbers computer words single bytes errorcorrecting codes based special checksums detect common errors also allow original data recovered certain cases

parity byte parity wordedit
simplest checksum algorithm socalled longitudinal parity check breaks data words fixed number bits computes exclusive words result appended message extra word check integrity message receiver computes exclusive words including checksum result word consisting zeros receiver knows transmission error occurred
checksum transmission error flips single message number bits detected incorrect checksum however error affects bits detected bits position distinct words also swapping words detected affected bits independently chosen random probability twobit error undetected
modular sumedit
