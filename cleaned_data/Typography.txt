evolutionedit
design typefaces developed alongside development typesetting systems30 although typography evolved significantly origins largely conservative tends cleave closely tradition31 legibility paramount typefaces readable usually retained addition evolution typography inextricably intertwined lettering hand related forms especially formal styles thrived centuries preceding typography31 evolution typography must discussed reference relationship
nascent stages european printing typeface blackletter gothic designed imitation popular handlettering styles scribes32 initially typeface difficult read letter place individually made tightly allocated space33 manuscript writing whose origin hellenistic roman bookmaking reached zenith illuminated manuscripts middle ages metal typefaces notably altered style making crisp uncompromising also brought standards composition31 renaissance period france claude garamond partially responsible adoption roman typeface eventually supplanted commonly used gothic blackletter348 roman typeface also based handlettering styles35
development roman typeface traced back greek lapidary letters greek lapidary letters carved stone first formal uses western letterforms roman lapidary letterforms evolved monumental capitals laid foundation western typographical design especially serif typefaces3410 styles roman typefaces style modern former characterized similarly weighted lines latter distinguished contrast light heavy lines32 often styles combined
twentieth century computers turned typeface design rather simplified process allowed number typefaces styles proliferate exponentially thousands available32 unfortunately confusion typeface font various styles single typeface occurred 1984 steve jobs mislabeled typefaces fonts apple computers error perpetuated throughout computer industry leading common misuse public term font typeface proper term

three fundamental aspects typography legibility readability aesthetics though nontechnical sense legible readable often used synonymously typographically separate related concepts39 legibility readability tend support aesthetic aspects product
legibility describes easily individual characters distinguished another described walter tracy quality decipherable recognisable39 instance difficult distinguish small sizes problem legibility39 typographers concerned legibility insofar select correct font brush script example font containing many characters might difficult distinguish selection case influences legibility typography using uppercase letters allcaps reduces legibility
readability refers easy read text whole opposed individual character recognition described legibility margins word linespacing clear document structure impact readability fonts font styles instance sansserif fonts considered readability unsuited large quantities prose39




text typeset example iowan style roman italics small caps optimized approximately words line typeface sized points leading points extra tracking using extract essay oscar wilde english renaissance 1882


legibility refers perception able determined physical limitations readability refers comprehension understanding meaning39 good typographers graphic designers achieve excellence
typeface chosen legible read without effort sometimes legibility simply matter type size often however matter typeface design case selection always influences legibility general typefaces true basic letterforms legible typefaces condensed expanded embellished abstracted

however even legible typeface become unreadable poor setting placement less legible typeface made readable good design40

studies legibility readability examined wide range factors including type size type design example comparing serif sansserif type roman type oblique type italic type line length line spacing color contrast design righthand edge example justification straight right hand edge ragged right whether text hyphenated justified copy must adjusted tightly typesetting prevent loss readability something beyond capabilities typical personal computers
legibility research published since late nineteenth century although often commonalities agreement many topics others often create poignant areas conflict variation opinion example alex poole asserts provided conclusive answer typeface style serif sans serif provides legibility41unreliable source although differences opinion exist regarding debates topics justified unjustified type hyphens proper typefaces people reading difficulties dyslexia continued subjects debate
legibility usually measured speed reading comprehension scores used check effectiveness rushed careless read example miles tinker published numerous studies 1930s 1960s used speed reading test required participants spot incongruous words effectiveness filter
readability print unit royal college professor herbert spencer brian linda reynolds42 important work area centres revealed importance saccadic rhythm movement readability—in particular ability take recognise meaning groups three words physiognomy means tires line required saccadic jumps found introduce strain errors reading doubling allcaps renders words indistinguishable groups letters presenting uniform line requiring special effort separation understanding
days legibility research tends limited critical issues testing specific design solutions example typefaces developed examples critical issues include typefaces people visual impairment typefaces case selection highway street signs conditions legibility make difference
much legibility research literature somewhat atheoretical—various factors tested individually combination inevitably different factors interdependent many tests carried absence model reading visual perception typographers believe overall word shape bouma important readability theory parallel letter recognition either wrong less important entire picture word shape differs outline influenced ascending descending elements lower case letters enables reading entire word without parse letter example easily distinguished becomes influential able read groups words time
studies distinguishing bouma recognition parallel letter recognition regard people recognize words read favored parallel letter recognition widely accepted cognitive psychologistscitation needed
commonly agreed findings legibility research includecitation needed

text lower case legible text upper case capitals allcaps presumably lower case letter structures word shapes distinctive
extenders ascenders descenders projecting parts increase salience prominence
regular upright type roman type found legible italic type
contrast without dazzling brightness also found important black yellowcream effective along white blue
positive images black white make handheld material easier read negative reversed white black even commonly accepted practice exceptions however example cases disability43unreliable source designing effective signs drivers
upper portions letters ascenders play stronger part recognition process lower portions

aesthetic concerns typography deals careful selection harmonizing typefaces relative type sizes also laying elements printed flat surface tastefully appealingly among others reason typographers attempt observe typographical principles common listed

limit three colors harmonize color paper dominant colors photo graphics
limit typefaces single page match
limit three fonts sizes
select size leading optimal pleasing eyes
number different enhancements greater size bold italic fonts capitalization different typeface different color used headlines emphasized words inside text block limited consistent judiciously selected
avoid underlining like pest another enhancement
text placed judiciously lead text cognitively natural next text
multiline headline segmented phrases phrase split lines
widows orphans beginning line paragraph bottom page last line paragraph page
likewise headline page bottom
last line paragraph flush preceding lines stand alone picture
printing elements scattered hodgepodge fashion across page unless truly conveys hodgepodge
letters beginning paragraph line extent little left vertical left flush line give optical impression flush lines

readability also compromised letterspacing word spacing leading tight loose improved generous vertical space separates lines text making easier distinguish line next previous line poorly designed typefaces tightly loosely fitted also result poor legibility underlining also reduce readability eliminating recognition effect contributed descending elements letters
periodical publications especially newspapers magazines typographical elements achieve attractive distinctive appearance readers navigating publication cases dramatic effect formulating style guide publication periodical standardizes relatively small collection typefaces used specific elements within publication makes consistent typefaces case type sizes italic boldface colors typographic features combining large small capital letters together publications guardian economist commission type designer create customized typefaces exclusive
different periodical publications design publications including typography achieve particular tone style example today uses bold colorful comparatively modern style variety typefaces colors type sizes vary widely newspapers name placed colored background contrast york times uses traditional approach fewer colors less typeface variation columns
especially front page newspapers magazine covers headlines often larger display typefaces attract attention placed near masthead
typography utilized characterize text typography intended reveal character text typography body text instantaneously reveal mood author intends convey readers message body text conveys direct relationship typeface chosen therefore person focusing typography setting type must close attention typeface decide choose choosing correct typeface body text done thoroughly reading text understanding context understanding text wishing convey typographer understanding text responsibility using appropriate typeface honor writing done author text knowledge choosing correct typeface comes along understanding historical background typefaces understanding reason typeface created example body text titled “commercial real estate transactions” elaborates real estate market throughout body appropriate typeface instance serif typeface typeface would appropriate author intends inform audience serious topic entertain audience anecdote therefore serif typeface would effectively convey sense seriousness audience instantaneously typographer would also employ largersized font title text convey sense importance title text directly informs reader structure text intended read well increasing readability varying viewing distances44
typography utilized make reading practical typography direct correlation honoring tone text also shares responsibility making audience commence reading process well sustaining audience’s attention throughout body text although typography potentially utilized attract readers attention commence reading process create beautifulattractive piece text craft typography limited aesthetics typography craft stringently encompassed aesthetic appeal text contrary object typography make reading experience practical useful bold colors multiple typefaces colorful backgrounds typographic design eyecatching however appropriate bodies text could potentially make text illegible overuse design elements colors typefaces create unsettling reading experience preventing author text conveying message readers45
