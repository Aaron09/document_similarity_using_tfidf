structureedit
veins present throughout body tubes carry blood back heart veins classified number ways including superficial deep pulmonary systemic large small

superficial veins closer surface body corresponding arteries
deep veins deeper body corresponding arteries
perforator veins drain superficial deep veins1 usually referred lower limbs feet
communicating veins veins directly connect superficial veins deep veins
pulmonary veins veins deliver oxygenated blood lungs heart
systemic veins drain tissues body deliver deoxygenated blood heart

veins equipped valves prevent blood flowing reverse direction
veins translucent color vein appears organisms exterior determined large part color venous blood usually dark result oxygen content veins appear blue subcutaneous absorbs lowfrequency light permitting highly energetic blue wavelengths penetrate dark vein reflect back viewer colour vein affected characteristics persons skin much oxygen carried blood deep vessels are2 vein drained blood removed organism appears greywhitecitation needed

branches inferior vena cava


largest veins human body venae cavae large veins enter right atrium heart superior vena cava carries blood arms head right atrium heart inferior vena cava carries blood legs abdomen heart inferior vena cava retroperitoneal runs right roughly parallel abdominal aorta along spine large veins feed veins smaller veins together forms venous system
whilst main veins hold relatively constant position position veins person person display quite variationcitation needed
pulmonary veins carry relatively oxygenated blood lungs heart superior inferior venae cavae carry relatively deoxygenated blood upper lower systemic circulations respectively
portal venous system series veins venules directly connect capillary beds examples systems include hepatic portal vein hypophyseal portal system
peripheral veins carry blood limbs hands feet
microanatomyedit
microscopically veins thick outer layer made connective tissue called tunica externa tunica adventitia middle layer bands smooth muscle called tunica media general much thinner arteries veins function primarily contractile manner subject high pressures systole arteries interior lined endothelial cells called tunica intima precise location veins varies much person person arteries3
functionedit
veins serve return blood organs heart veins also called capacitance vessels blood volume contained within veins systemic circulation oxygenated blood pumped left ventricle arteries muscles organs body nutrients gases exchanged capillaries taking cellular waste carbon dioxide capillaries blood channeled vessels converge another form venules continue converge form larger veins deoxygenated blood taken veins right atrium heart transfers blood right ventricle pumped pulmonary arteries lungs pulmonary circulation pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood lungs left atrium empties left ventricle completing cycle blood circulation
return blood heart assisted action muscle pump thoracic pump action breathing respiration standing sitting prolonged period time cause venous return venous pooling vascular shock fainting occur usually baroreceptors within aortic sinuses initiate baroreflex angiotensin norepinephrine stimulate vasoconstriction heart rate increases return blood flow neurogenic hypovolaemic shock also cause fainting cases smooth muscles surrounding veins become slack veins fill majority blood body keeping blood away brain causing unconsciousness pilots wear pressurized suits help maintain venous return blood pressure
arteries perceived carrying oxygenated blood tissues veins carry deoxygenated blood back heart true systemic circulation larger circuits blood body transports oxygen heart tissues body however pulmonary circulation arteries carry deoxygenated blood heart lungs veins return blood lungs heart difference veins arteries direction flow heart arteries returning heart veins oxygen content addition deoxygenated blood carried tissues back heart reoxygenation systemic circulation still carries oxygen though considerably less carried systemic arteries pulmonary veins
although veins take blood back heart exception portal veins carry blood capillary beds example hepatic portal vein takes blood capillary beds digestive tract transports capillary beds liver blood drained gastrointestinal tract spleen taken hepatic veins blood taken back heart since important function mammals damage hepatic portal vein dangerous blood clotting hepatic portal vein cause portal hypertension results decrease blood fluid liver
cardiac veinsedit
vessels remove deoxygenated blood heart muscle known cardiac veins include great cardiac vein middle cardiac vein small cardiac vein smallest cardiac veins anterior cardiac veins coronary veins carry blood poor level oxygen myocardium right atrium blood coronary veins returns coronary sinus anatomy veins heart variable generally formed following veins heart veins coronary sinus great cardiac vein middle cardiac vein small cardiac vein posterior vein left ventricle vein marshall heart veins directly right atrium anterior cardiac veins smallest cardiac veins thebesian veins4
clinical significanceedit
diseasesedit
venous insufficiencyedit
main article chronic venous insufficiency
venous insufficiency common disorder venous system usually manifested spider veins varicose veins several varieties treatments used depending patients particular type pattern veins physicians preferences treatment include endovenous thermal ablation using radiofrequency laser energy vein stripping ambulatory phlebectomy foam sclerotherapy lasers compression
postphlebitic syndrome venous insufficiency develops following deep vein thrombosis5
deep vein thrombosisedit
main article deep vein thrombosis
deep vein thrombosis condition blood clot forms deep vein usually veins legs although also occur veins arms immobility active cancer obesity traumatic damage congenital disorders make clots likely risk factors deep vein thrombosis cause affected limb swell cause pain overlying skin rash worst case deep vein thrombosis extend part clot break land lungs called pulmonary embolism
decision treat deep vein thrombosis depends size persons symptoms risk factors generally involves anticoagulation prevents clots reduce size clot
portal hypertensionedit
portal veins found within abdomen carry blood liver portal hypertension associated cirrhosis disease liver conditions obstructing clot budd chiari syndrome compression tumours tuberculosis lesions pressure increases portal veins collateral circulation develops causing visible veins oesophageal varices
otheredit
thrombophlebitis inflammatory condition veins related blood clots
imagingedit

great saphenous vein important superficial vein lower limb first described persian physician avicenna vein derives name word safina meaning hidden vein hidden fascial compartment thigh exits fascia near knee incompetence vein important cause varicose veins lower limbs
thebesian veins within myocardium heart valveless veins drain directly chambers heart coronary veins empty coronary sinus empties right atrium
