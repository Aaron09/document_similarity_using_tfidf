examplesedit

fossil plant paradinandra suecica could assigned family placed incertae sedis within order ericales described 20015
fossil gluteus minimus described 1975 could assigned known animal phylum6 genus therefore incertae sedis within kingdom animalia
unclear order world vultures family cathartidae assigned placed aves incertae sedis7 later agreed place separate order cathartiformes8
bocages longbill amaurocichla bocagei species passerine bird belongs superfamily passeroidea since unclear family belongs classified passeroidea incertae sedis
hela cells descended human cervical cancer cells diverge genetically normal human cells sufficiently categorized species largely incertae sedis taxonomy

formal nomenclatureedit
formally naming taxon uncertainty taxonomic classification problematic international code nomenclature algae fungi plants stipulates species subdivisions genera must assigned genera infraspecific taxa must assigned species names combinations ranks higher genus assigned incertae sedis9
reason useedit
poor descriptionedit
excerpt 2007 scientific paper crustaceans kurilkamchatka trench japan trench describes typical circumstances category applied discussing10

removal many genera existing families state incertae sedis reduced status attributed largely poor inadequate descriptions accepted vagueness analysis insufficient character states also evident proportion characters used analysis given states particular taxa inappropriate invalid additional complexity factors misled earlier authorities intrusion extensive homoplasies apparent character state reversals convergent evolution

included analysisedit
formal phylogenetic analysis conducted include certain taxon authors might choose label taxon incertae sedis instead guessing placement particularly common molecular phylogenies generated since tissue many rare organisms hard obtain also common scenario fossil taxa included since many fossils defined based partial information example phylogeny constructed using soft tissue vertebrae principal characters taxon question known single tooth would necessary label incertae sedis4
controversyedit
conflicting results exist consensus among researchers taxon relates organisms listed incertae sedis conflict resolved4
zoological nomenclatureedit
botany name validly published accepted author publication9article zoology name proposed conditionally available certain conditions1articles uncertainties lower levels system open nomenclature suggests question marks used denote questionable assignment4 example species given specific epithet album anton attributed uncertainty agenus could denoted agenus album anton anton anton indicates author assigned question mark4 anton described agenus album bruno called assignment doubt could denoted agenus album anton bruno parentheses around anton original assignment agenus modified agenus bruno4
