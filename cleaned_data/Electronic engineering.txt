subfieldsedit
electronic engineering many subfields section describes popular subfields electronic engineering although engineers focus exclusively subfield also many focus combination subfields
signal processing deals analysis manipulation signals signals either analog case signal varies continuously according information digital case signal varies according series discrete values representing information
analog signals signal processing involve amplification filtering audio signals audio equipment modulation demodulation signals telecommunications digital signals signal processing involve compression error checking error detection digital signals
telecommunications engineering deals transmission information across channel coaxial cable optical fiber free space
