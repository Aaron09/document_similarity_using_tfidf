congestive heart failure marked jugular venous distension external jugular vein marked arrow


heart failure symptoms traditionally somewhat arbitrarily divided left right sided recognizing left right ventricles heart supply different portions circulation however heart failure exclusively backward failure part circulation drains ventricle
several exceptions simple leftright division heart failure symptoms additionally common cause rightsided heart failure leftsided heart failure24 result patients commonly present sets signs symptoms
leftsided failureedit
left side heart responsible receiving oxygenrich blood lungs pumping forward systemic circulation rest body except pulmonary circulation failure left side heart causes blood back congested lungs causing respiratory symptoms well fatigue insufficient supply oxygenated blood common respiratory signs increased rate breathing increased work breathing nonspecific signs respiratory distress rales crackles heard initially lung bases severe throughout lung fields suggest development pulmonary edema fluid alveoli cyanosis suggests severe blood oxygen late sign extremely severe pulmonary edema
additional signs indicating left ventricular failure include laterally displaced apex beat occurs heart enlarged gallop rhythm additional heart sounds heard marker increased blood flow increased intracardiac pressure heart murmurs indicate presence valvular heart disease either cause aortic stenosis result mitral regurgitation heart failure
backward failure left ventricle causes congestion lungs blood vessels symptoms predominantly respiratory nature backward failure subdivided failure left atrium left ventricle within left circuit patient dyspnea shortness breath exertion severe cases dyspnea rest increasing breathlessness lying flat called orthopnea occurs often measured number pillows required comfortably orthopnea patient resort sleeping sitting another symptom heart failure paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea sudden nighttime attack severe breathlessness usually several hours going sleep easy fatigability exercise intolerance also common complaints related respiratory compromise
cardiac asthma wheezing occur
compromise left ventricular forward function result symptoms poor systemic circulation dizziness confusion cool extremities rest
rightsided failureedit




severe peripheral pitting edema


rightsided heart failure often caused pulmonary heart disease pulmonale usually caused difficulties pulmonary circulation pulmonary hypertension pulmonic stenosis
physical examination reveal pitting peripheral edema ascites liver enlargement jugular venous pressure frequently assessed marker fluid status accentuated eliciting hepatojugular reflux right ventricular pressure increased parasternal heave present signifying compensatory increase contraction strength
backward failure right ventricle leads congestion systemic capillaries generates excess fluid accumulation body causes swelling skin termed peripheral edema anasarca usually affects dependent parts body first causing foot ankle swelling people standing sacral edema people predominantly lying nocturia frequent nighttime urination occur fluid legs returned bloodstream lying night progressively severe cases ascites fluid accumulation abdominal cavity causing swelling liver enlargement develop significant liver congestion result impaired liver function congestive hepatopathy jaundice even coagulopathy problems decreased increased blood clotting occur
biventricular failureedit
dullness lung fields finger percussion reduced breath sounds bases lung suggest development pleural effusion fluid collection lung chest wall though occur isolated left rightsided heart failure common biventricular failure pleural veins drain systemic pulmonary venous systems unilateral effusions often right sided
person failure ventricle lives long enough tend progress failure ventricles example left ventricular failure allows pulmonary edema pulmonary hypertension occur increase stress right ventricle right ventricular failure deleterious side neither harmless

comparison healthy heart contracted muscle left weakened heart overstretched muscle right


heart failure caused condition reduces efficiency heart muscle damage overloading caused wide number conditions including myocardial infarction heart muscle starved oxygen dies hypertension increases force contraction needed pump blood amyloidosis misfolded proteins deposited heart muscle causing stiffen time increases workload produce changes heart
heart person heart failure reduced force contraction overloading ventricle healthy heart increased filling ventricle results increased contraction force frankâ€“starling heart thus rise cardiac output heart failure mechanism fails ventricle loaded blood point heart muscle contraction becomes less efficient reduced ability crosslink actin myosin filaments overstretched heart muscle29
reduced stroke volume occur result failure systole diastole increased systolic volume usually caused reduced contractility decreased diastolic volume results impaired ventricular filling occurs compliance ventricle falls walls stiffen heart works harder meet normal metabolic demands amount cardiac output increase times increased oxygen demand exercise reduced contributes exercise intolerance commonly seen heart failure translates loss ones cardiac reserve ability heart work harder strenuous physical activity since heart work harder meet normal metabolic demands incapable meeting metabolic demands body exercise
common finding heart failure increased heart rate stimulated increased sympathetic activity30 order maintain adequate cardiac output initially helps compensate heart failure maintaining blood pressure perfusion places strain myocardium increasing coronary perfusion requirements lead worsening ischemic heart disease sympathetic activity also cause potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythms increase physical size hearts muscular layer occur caused terminally differentiated heart muscle fibers increasing size attempt improve contractility contribute increased stiffness thus decrease ability relax diastole enlargement ventricles also occur contributes enlargement spherical shape failing heart increase ventricular volume also causes reduction stroke volume mechanical inefficient contraction heart31
general effect reduced cardiac output increased strain heart increases risk cardiac arrest specifically abnormal ventricular heart rhythms reduces blood supply rest body chronic disease reduced cardiac output causes number changes rest body physiological compensations part disease process

arterial blood pressure falls destimulates baroreceptors carotid sinus aortic arch link nucleus tractus solitarii center brain increases sympathetic activity releasing catecholamines blood stream binding alpha1 receptors results systemic arterial vasoconstriction helps restore blood pressure also increases total peripheral resistance increasing workload heart binding beta1 receptors myocardium increases heart rate makes contractions forceful attempt increase cardiac output also however increases amount work heart perform
increased sympathetic stimulation also causes posterior pituitary secrete vasopressin also known antidiuretic hormone causes fluid retention kidneys increases blood volume blood pressure
heart failure also limits kidneys ability dispose sodium water increases edema32 reduced blood flow kidneys stimulates release renin enzyme catalyses production potent vasopressor angiotensin angiotensin metabolites cause vasoconstriction stimulate increased secretion steroid aldosterone adrenal glands promotes salt fluid retention kidneys
chronically high levels circulating neuroendocrine hormones catecholamines renin angiotensin aldosterone affect myocardium directly causing structural remodelling heart long term many remodelling effects seem mediated transforming growth factor beta tgfbeta common downstream target signal transduction cascade initiated catecholamines33 angiotensin ii34 also epidermal growth factor target signaling pathway activated aldosterone35
reduced perfusion skeletal muscle causes atrophy muscle fibers result weakness increased fatiguability decreased peak strength contributing exercise intolerance36

increased peripheral resistance greater blood volume place strain heart accelerates process damage myocardium vasoconstriction fluid retention produce increased hydrostatic pressure capillaries shifts balance forces favor interstitial fluid formation increased pressure forces additional fluid blood tissue results edema fluid buildup tissues rightsided heart failure commonly starts ankles venous pressure high effects gravity although patient bedridden fluid accumulation begin sacral region also occur abdominal cavity fluid buildup called ascites leftsided heart failure edema occur lungs called cardiogenic pulmonary edema reduces spare capacity ventilation causes stiffening lungs reduces efficiency exchange increasing distance blood consequences dyspnea shortness breath orthopnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
symptoms heart failure largely determined side heart fails left side pumps blood systemic circulation whilst right side pumps blood pulmonary circulation whilst leftsided heart failure reduce cardiac output systemic circulation initial symptoms often manifest effects pulmonary circulation systolic dysfunction ejection fraction decreased leaving abnormally elevated volume blood left ventricle diastolic dysfunction enddiastolic ventricular pressure high increase volume pressure backs left atrium pulmonary veins increased volume pressure pulmonary veins impairs normal drainage alveoli favors flow fluid capillaries lung parenchyma causing pulmonary edema impairs exchange thus leftsided heart failure often presents respiratory symptoms shortness breath orthopnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
severe cardiomyopathy effects decreased cardiac output poor perfusion become apparent patients manifest cold clammy extremities cyanosis claudication generalized weakness dizziness fainting
resultant blood oxygen caused pulmonary edema causes vasoconstriction pulmonary circulation results pulmonary hypertension since right ventricle generates lower pressures left ventricle approximately mmhg versus around mmhg respectively healthy individual nonetheless generates cardiac output exactly equal left ventricle means small increase pulmonary vascular resistance causes large increase amount work right ventricle must perform however main mechanism leftsided heart failure causes rightsided heart failure actually well understood theories invoke mechanisms mediated neurohormonal activation37 mechanical effects also contribute left ventricle distends intraventricular septum bows right ventricle decreasing capacity right ventricle

ventricle inadequately emptied ventricular enddiastolic pressure volumes increase transmitted atrium left side heart increased pressure transmitted pulmonary vasculature resultant hydrostatic pressure favors extravasation fluid lung parenchyma causing pulmonary edema right side heart increased pressure transmitted systemic venous circulation systemic capillary beds favoring extravasation fluid tissues target organs extremities resulting dependent peripheral edema
diastolic dysfunctionedit
main article heart failure preserved ejection fraction
heart failure caused diastolic dysfunction generally described backward failure ventricle adequately relax typically denotes stiffer ventricular wall stiffness contractility ventricular walls diastole first described pierresimon laplace causes inadequate filling ventricle therefore results inadequate stroke volume mathematical term amenable manipulation many variables failure ventricular relaxation also results elevated enddiastolic pressures result identical case systolic dysfunction pulmonary edema left heart failure peripheral edema right heart failure
diastolic dysfunction caused processes similar cause systolic dysfunction particularly causes affect cardiac remodeling
diastolic dysfunction manifest except physiologic extremes systolic function preserved patient completely asymptomatic rest however exquisitely sensitive increases heart rate sudden bouts tachycardia caused simply physiological responses exertion fever dehydration pathological tachyarrhythmias atrial fibrillation rapid ventricular response result flash pulmonary edema adequate rate control usually pharmacological agent slows conduction calcium channel blocker betablocker therefore importance preventing acute decompensation
left ventricular diastolic function determined echocardiography measurement various parameters ratio earlytoatrial left ventricular filling ratio early left ventricular filling deceleration time isovolumic relaxation time
