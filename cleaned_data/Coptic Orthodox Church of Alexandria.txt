also noted anathemizing pope tone content tome alexandrine theology perception pope dioscorus found guilty without process words tome subject heresy first place question questioning reasons behind either acknowledged read second council ephesus pope dioscorus alexandria never labeled heretic councils canons
copts also believe pope alexandria forcibly prevented attending third congregation council ousted apparently result conspiracy tailored roman delegates10
current positive eastern oriental orthodox dialogues chalcedonians sometimes used call nonchalcedonians monophysites though coptic orthodox church reality regards monophysitism heresy chalcedonian doctrine turn came known dyophysite
term comes closer coptic orthodoxy miaphysite refers conjoined nature christ human divine united indivisibly incarnate logos coptic orthodox church alexandria believes christ perfect divinity perfect humanity divinity humanity united nature called nature incarnate word reiterated saint cyril alexandria
