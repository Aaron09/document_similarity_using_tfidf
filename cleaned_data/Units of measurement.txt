unit measurement definite magnitude quantity defined adopted convention used standard measurement kind quantity1 quantity kind expressed multiple unit measurement
example length physical quantity metre unit length represents definite predetermined length metres actually mean times definite predetermined length called metre measurement process determining large small physical quantity compared basic reference quantity kind
definition agreement practical units measurement played crucial role human endeavour early ages present multitude systems units used common global standard international system units modern form metric system
trade weights measures often subject governmental regulation ensure fairness transparency international bureau weights measures bipm tasked ensuring worldwide uniformity measurements traceability international system units
metrology science developing nationally internationally accepted units measurement
physics metrology units standards measurement physical quantities need clear definitions useful reproducibility experimental results central scientific method standard system units facilitates scientific systems units refinement concept weights measures historically developed commercial purposes
science medicine engineering often larger smaller units measurement used everyday life judicious selection units measurement researchers problem solving example dimensional analysis
social sciences standard units measurement theory practice measurement studied psychometrics theory conjoint measurement

historyedit
main article history measurement
unit measurement standardised quantity physical property used factor express occurring quantities property units measurement among earliest tools invented humans primitive societies needed rudimentary measures many tasks constructing dwellings appropriate size shape fashioning clothing bartering food materials
earliest known uniform systems measurement seem created sometime millennia among ancient peoples mesopotamia egypt indus valley perhaps also elam persia well
weights measures mentioned bible leviticus 1935–36 commandment honest fair measures
magna carta 1215 great charter seal king john barons england king john agreed clause shall measure wine throughout whole realm measure measure corn—namely london quart—and width dyed russet hauberk cloths—namely ells selvage
21st century multiple unit systems used world united states customary system british customary system international system however united states industrialized country completely converted metric system systematic effort develop universally acceptable system units dates back 1790 french national assembly charged french academy sciences come unit system system precursor metric system quickly developed france take universal acceptance 1875 metric convention treaty signed nations treaty signed general conference weights measures cgpm established cgpm produced current system adopted 1954 10th conference weights measures currently united states dualsystem society uses system customary system2

imperial units customary units derive earlier english units imperial units mostly used british commonwealth former british empire customary units still main system measurement used united states despite congress legally authorized metric measure july 18663 steps towards metrication made particularly redefinition basic imperial units derive exactly units since international yard pound agreement 1959 imperial inch defined exactly 6998254000000000000♠00254 imperial avoirdupois pound defined exactly 6999453592370000000♠45359237
natural systemsedit
systems units based arbitrary unit values formalised standards unit values occur naturally science systems units based called natural units similar natural units atomic units convenient system units measurement used atomic physics
also great number unusual nonstandard units encountered include solar mass 7030200000000000000♠2×1030 megaton energy released detonating million tons trinitrotoluene
legal control weights measuresedit
main articles weights measures trading standards
reduce incidence retail fraud many national statutes standard definitions weights measures used hence statute measure verified legal officers
base derived unitsedit
different systems units based different choices base units widely used system units international system units seven base units units derived base units
quantities unit necessary communicate values physical quantity example conveying someone particular length without using sort unit impossible length cannot described without reference used make sense value given
quantities require unit using physical laws units quantities expressed combinations units quantities thus small units required units taken base units units derived units derived units matter convenience expressed terms basic units units considered base units matter choice
base units actually smallest possible smaller sets defined example unit sets electric magnetic field unitcitation needed based physical laws show electric magnetic field actually different manifestations phenomenon

distinction made units standards unit fixed definition independent physical conditions temperature contrast standard physical realization unit realizes unit certain physical conditions example metre unit metal standard metre length regardless temperature metal exactly metre long certain temperature
certain rules used dealing units

treat units algebraically like terms unit divided division yields unitless different units multiplied divided result unit referred combination units instance unit speed metres second dimensional analysis unit multiplied creating unit exponent m2s2 simply units obey laws indices exponentiation
units special names however treated like equivalents example newton equivalent kg·ms2 thus quantity several unit designations example unit surface tension referred either newtons metre kgs2 kilograms second squared whether designations equivalent disputed amongst metrologists5
