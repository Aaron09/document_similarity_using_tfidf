dangerous play raised ballsedit

velocity ball mentioned rules concerning dangerously played ball ball hits player knee occasions penalized umpires discretion tackle example might accidentally lift ball knee height opponent close range velocity opinion umpire dangerous play highvelocity close range opponent knee height could considered dangerous reckless play view umpire especially safer alternatives open striker ball
ball lifted high fall among close opponents deemed potentially dangerous play stopped reason lifted ball falling player clear space made potentially dangerous actions opponent closing within receiver ball controlled ground rule often loosely applied distance allowed often might described playing distance opponents tend permitted close ball soon receiver plays unofficial variations often based umpires perception skill players level game order maintain game flow umpires general rules briefing instructed penalising unnecessary also matter umpires discretion
term falling ball important termed encroaching offences generally considered offence encroach opponent receiving lifted ball lifted head height although height specified rule falling example lifted shot goal still rising crosses goal line would rising crossed goal line legitimately followed attacking team looking rebound
general even potentially dangerous play penalised opponent disadvantaged obviously injured cannot continue personal penalty caution suspension rather team penalty free ball penalty corner many would even must umpires discretion issued guilty party advantage allowed umpire played situation offence occurred including dangerous play advantage allowed umpire cannot call play back award team penalty
offence lift ball opponents stick body ground provided done consideration safety opponent dangerously example skillful attacker lift ball defenders stick prone body past however attacker lifts ball defenders body would almost certainly regarded dangerous
rules bounce ball stick even long lead potentially dangerous conflict opponent attempting make tackle example players trying play ball time would probably considered dangerous situation likely player first ball carrying would penalised
dangerous play rules also apply usage stick approaching ball making stroke replacing time referred sticks rule forbade raising part stick shoulder play last restriction removed stick still used endangers opponent attempting tackle fouls relating tripping impeding obstruction stick strike opponent usually much severely dealt umpires offences barging impeding obstruction body although also dealt firmly especially fouls intentional field hockey noncontact game
players play attempt play ball shoulders unless trying save shot could goal case permitted stop ball deflect safely away swing high shot goal even wide goal probably considered dangerous play opponents within stroke would contrary rule circumstances anyway
within english national league legal action take ball shoulder height completed using controlled action
