satellite orbitsedit
communications satellites usually three primary types orbit orbital classifications used specify orbital details

geostationary satellites geostationary orbit 35786 kilometres 22236 earth’s surface orbit special characteristic apparent position satellite viewed ground observer change satellite appears stand still satellites orbital period rotation rate earth advantage orbit ground antennas track satellite across fixed point location satellite appears
medium earth orbit satellites closer earth orbital altitudes range 2000 35786 kilometres 1243 22236 earth
region medium orbits referred earth orbit 2000 kilometres 1243 earth

satellites orbit earth faster remain visible fixed point earth continually like geostationary satellite appear ground observer cross behind earth therefore provide continuous communications capability lower orbits requires larger number satellites always transmission communication signals however relatively small distance earth signals strongerclarification needed
