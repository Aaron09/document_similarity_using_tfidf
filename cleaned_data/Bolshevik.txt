bolshevik leaders either supporting bogdanov undecided mid1908 differences became irreconcilable lenin concentrated undermining bogdanovs reputation philosopher 1909 published scathing book criticism entitled materialism empiriocriticism 190922 assaulting bogdanovs position accusing philosophical idealism23 june 1909 bogdanov proposed formation party schools proletarian universities bolshevik miniconference paris organised editorial board bolshevik magazine proletary june 1909 however accepted lenin tried expel bolshevik faction24 bogdanov involved setting vpered capri party school august december 190925

bolsheviks mensheviks weakened splits within ranks tsarist repression tempted reunite party january 1910 leninists recallists various menshevik factions held meeting partys central committee paris kamenev zinoviev dubious idea willing give pressure conciliator bolsheviks like victor nogin
underlying reasons aided preventing reunification party russian police police able infiltrate parties inner circles sending spies reported opposing partys intentions hostilities26 allowed tensions remain high bolsheviks mensheviks turn prevented uniting common ground could possibly sped entire revolution
lenin firmly opposed reunification outvoted within bolshevik leadership meeting reached tentative agreement provisions made trotskys viennabased pravda partyfinanced central organ kamenev trotskys brotherinlaw added editorial board bolsheviks unification attempts failed august 1910 kamenev resigned board amid mutual recriminations

differences party agendas became evident beginning world loomed near stalin especially eager start hoping would turn classes essentially russian civil war28 desire fueled lenins vision workers peasants would resist joining effort therefore compelled join socialist movement increase support russia would forced withdraw allied powers order resolve internal conflict unfortunately bolsheviks lenins assumptions incorrect despite partys attempts push civil involvement conferences 1915 1916 switzerland party remained minority calling ceasefire russian army world
although bolshevik leadership decided form separate party convincing probolshevik workers within russia follow suit proved difficult first meeting fourth duma convened late 1912 bolshevik deputies matvei muranov another roman malinovsky later exposed okhrana tsarist secret police agent voted break away menshevik faction within duma december 191229 bolshevik leadership eventually prevailed bolsheviks formed duma faction september 1913
