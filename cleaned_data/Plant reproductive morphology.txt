dioicous gametophytes liverwort marchantia polymorpha species gametes produced different plants umbrellashaped gametophores different morphologies radiating arms female gameteophores left protect archegonia produce eggs male gametophores right topped antheridia produce sperm


plants complex lifecycles involving alternation generations generation sporophyte gives rise next generation asexually spores spores identical isospores come different sizes microspores megaspores strictly speaking spores sporophytes neither male female produce gametes alternate generation gametophyte produces gametes eggs andor sperm gametophyte monoicous bisexual producing eggs sperm dioicous unisexual either female producing eggs male producing sperm
bryophytes liverworts mosses hornworts sexual gametophyte dominant generation ferns seed plants including cycads conifers flowering plants sporophyte dominant generation obvious visible plant whether small herb large tree sporophyte gametophyte small seed plants female gametophyte spore gives rise hidden within sporophyte entirely dependent nutrition male gametophyte typically consists four cells enclosed within protective wall pollen grain
sporophyte flowering plant often described using sexual terms female male based sexuality gametophyte gives rise example sporophyte produces spores give rise male gametophytes described male even though sporophyte asexual producing spores similarly flowers produced sporophyte described unisexual bisexual meaning give rise either gametophyte sexes gametophyte2

flower ranunculus glaberrimus


flower characteristic structure concerned sexual reproduction flowering plants angiosperms flowers vary enormously construction morphology complete flower like ranunculus glaberrimus shown figure calyx outer sepals corolla inner petals sepals petals together form perianth next inwards numerous stamens produce pollen grains containing microscopic male gametophyte stamens called male parts flower collectively form androecium finally middle carpels maturity contain ovules within ovule tiny female gametophyte3 carpels called female parts flower collectively form gynoecium
carpel ranunculus species achene produces ovule4 fertilized becomes seed carpel contains seed eranthis hyemalis called follicle carpels fused together varying degrees entire structure including fused styles stigmas called pistil lower part pistil ovules produced called ovary divided chambers locules corresponding separate carpels5

perfect flower stamens carpels described bisexual hermaphroditic unisexual flower either stamens carpels missing vestigial otherwise nonfunctional flower either staminate functional stamens thus male carpellate pistillate functional carpels thus female separate staminate carpellate flowers always found plant species called monoecious separate staminate carpellate flowers always found different plants species called dioecious6 1995 study found angiosperm species dioecious genera contain dioecious species7
members birch family betulaceae examples monoecious plants unisexual flowers mature alder tree alnus species produces long catkins containing male flowers four stamens minute perianth separate stalked groups female flowers without perianth8 illustration alnus serrulata
hollies members genus ilex dioecious plant produces either functionally male flowers functionally female flowers ilex aquifolium illustration common european holly kinds flower four sepals four white petals male flowers four stamens female flowers usually four nonfunctional reduced stamens fourcelled ovary9 since female plants able fruit produce berries consequences gardeners amborella represents first known group flowering plants separate common ancestor dioecious time plant produces either flowers functional stamens carpels flowers nonfunctional stamens number fully functional carpels however amborella plants change time study five cuttings male plant produced male flowers first flowered second flowering three switched producing female flowers10
extreme cases parts present complete flower missing long least carpel stamen present situation reached female flowers duckweeds lemna comprise single carpel male flowers spurges euphorbia comprise single stamen11
species fraxinus excelsior common europe demonstrates possible kind variation flowers windpollinated lack petals sepals structurally flowers bisexual consisting stamens ovary male staminate lacking functional ovary female carpellate lacking functional stamens different forms occur tree different trees8 asteraceae sunflower family close 22000 species worldwide highly modified inflorescences made flowers florets collected together tightly packed heads heads florets sexual morphology bisexual carpellate staminate called homogamous mixtures sexual forms heterogamous12 thus goatsbeards tragopogon species heads bisexual florets like members tribe cichorieae13 whereas marigolds calendula species generally heads outer florets bisexual inner florets staminate male14
like amborella plants undergo sexswitching example arisaema triphyllum jackinthepulpit expresses sexual differences different stages growth smaller plants produce mostly male flowers plants grow larger years male flowers replaced female flowers plant arisaema triphyllum thus covers multitude sexual conditions lifetime nonsexual juvenile plants young plants male larger plants male female flowers large plants mostly female flowers15 plant populations plants produce male flowers early year plants bloom later growing season produce female flowerscitation needed

outcrossingedit
outcrossing crossfertilization allogamy offspring formed fusion gametes different plants common mode reproduction among higher plants higher plant species reproduce additional partially crossfertilizing partially selffertilizing autogamy produce gametes principally selffertilizing significant outcrossing lacking higher plant species reproduce exclusively nonsexual means include plants reproduce vegetatively runners bulbils produce seeds without embryo fertilization apomixis selective advantage outcrossing appears masking deleterious recessive mutations24
primary mechanism used flowering plants ensure outcrossing involves genetic mechanism known selfincompatibility various aspects floral morphology promote allogamy plants bisexual flowers anthers carpels mature different times plants protandrous anthers maturing first protogynous carpels mature firstcitation needed monoecious species unisexual flowers plant produce male female flowers different timescitation needed
dioecy condition unisexual flowers different plants necessarily results outcrossing might thus thought evolved purpose however dioecy proven difficult explain simply outbreeding mechanism plants lack selfincompatibility7 resourceallocation constraints important evolution dioecy example windpollination separate male flowers arranged catkin vibrates wind provide better pollen dispersal7 climbing plants rapid upward growth essential resource allocation fruit production incompatible rapid growth thus giving advantage delayed production female flowers7 dioecy evolved separately many different lineages monoecy plant lineage correlates evolution dioecy suggesting dioecy evolve readily plants already produce separate male female flowers7
