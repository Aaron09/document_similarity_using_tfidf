word missile comes latin verb mittere meaning send2
military usage munitions projected towards target broadly categorised followscitation needed

powered guided munition travels space known missile guided missile
powered unguided munition known rocket
unpowered munitions fired called bombs whether guided unpowered guided munitions known guided bombs smart bombs
munitions fired known projectiles whether guided explosive known specifically shells mortar bombs
powered munitions travel water called torpedoes older usage includes fixed torpedoes might today called mines
hand grenades usually classed missiles

common subdivision consider ballistic missile mean munition follows ballistic trajectory cruise missile describe munition generates lift similar airplane

missiles targeted number ways common method form radiation infrared lasers radio waves guide missile onto target radiation emanate target heat engine radio waves enemy radar provided missile radar provided friendly third party radar launch vehicleplatform laser designator operated friendly infantry first often known fireandforget need support control launch vehicleplatform order function another method guidance—using either visible light infrared—in order target picture used either human operator steers missile onto target computer much bizarre guidance methods instead used pigeon steer missile target
many missiles combination methods improve accuracy chances successful engagement
targeting systemsedit
another method target missile knowing location target using guidance system tercom satellite guidance guidance system guides missile knowing missiles current position position target calculating course also performed somewhat crudely human operator target missile guide using either cable radiobased remote control automatic system simultaneously track target missile furthermore missiles initial targeting sending target area switch primary targeting using either radar targeting acquire target
flight systemedit
whether guided missile uses targeting system guidance system needs flight system flight system uses data targeting guidance system maneuver missile flight allowing counter inaccuracies missile follow moving target main systems vectored thrust missiles powered throughout guidance phase flight aerodynamic maneuvering wings fins canard aeronautics
engineedit




solid rocket motor


missiles powered engine generally either type rocket engine engine rockets generally solid propellant type ease maintenance fast deployment although larger ballistic missiles liquidpropellant rockets engines generally used cruise missiles commonly turbojet type relative simplicity frontal area turbofans ramjets common forms engine propulsion although type engine could theoretically used longrange missiles multiple engine stages particularly launched surface stages similar types include engine types example surfacelaunched cruise missiles often rocket booster launching engine sustained flight
missiles additional propulsion another source launch example launched catapult mgm51 shillelagh fired tank using smaller charge would used shell
warheadedit
missiles generally explosive warheads although weapon types also used warheads missile provide primary destructive power many missiles extensive secondary destructive power high kinetic energy weapon unburnt fuel board warheads commonly high explosive type often employing shaped charges exploit accuracy guided weapon destroy hardened targets warhead types include submunitions incendiaries nuclear weapons chemical biological radiological weapons kinetic energy penetrators warheadless missiles often used testing training purposes
basic rolesedit
also list missiles
missiles generally categorized launch platform intended target broadest terms either surface ground water subcategorized range exact target type antitank antiship many weapons designed launched surface designed attack either surface targets adats missile weapons require modification order launched surface adding boosters surfacelaunched version
ballisticedit

cruise missiles generally associated landattack operations also important role antishipping weapons primarily launched submarine platforms roles although landbased launchers also exist
