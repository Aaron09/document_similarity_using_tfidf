ever since people first recognized health related quality environment applied principles attempt improve quality environment ancient indian harappan civilization utilized early sewers cities 5000 years romans constructed aqueducts prevent drought create clean healthful water supply metropolis rome 15th century bavaria created laws restricting development degradation alpine country constituted regions water supply
field emerged separate environmental discipline middle third 20th century response widespread public concern water pollution increasingly extensive environmental quality degradation however roots extend back early efforts public health engineering8 modern environmental engineering began london mid19th century joseph bazalgette designed first major sewerage system reduced incidence waterborne diseases cholera introduction drinking water treatment sewage treatment industrialized countries reduced waterborne diseases leading causes death rarities9
many cases societies grew actions intended achieve benefits societies longerterm impacts reduced environmental qualities example widespread application pesticide control agricultural pests years following world agricultural benefits outstanding crop yields increased dramatically thus reducing world hunger substantially malaria controlled better ever numerous species brought verge extinction impact reproductive cycles story vividly told rachel carsons silent spring 1962 considered birth modern environmental movement modern field environmental engineering10
