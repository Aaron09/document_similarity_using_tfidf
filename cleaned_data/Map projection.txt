choosing model shape bodyedit
projection construction also affected shape earth planetary body approximated following section projection categories earth taken sphere order simplify discussion however earths actual shape closer oblate ellipsoid whether spherical ellipsoidal principles discussed hold without loss generality
selecting model shape earth involves choosing advantages disadvantages sphere versus ellipsoid spherical models useful smallscale maps world atlases globes since error scale usually noticeable important enough justify using complicated ellipsoid ellipsoidal model commonly used construct topographic maps large mediumscale maps need accurately depict land surface auxiliary latitudes often employed projecting ellipsoid
