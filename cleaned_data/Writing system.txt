writing system conventional method visually representing verbal communication writing speech useful conveying messages writing differs also reliable form information storage transfer1 processes encoding decoding writing systems involve shared understanding writers readers meaning behind sets characters make script writing usually recorded onto durable medium paper electronic storage although nondurable methods also used writing computer display blackboard sand skywriting
general attributes writing systems placed broad categories alphabets syllabaries logographies particular system attributes category alphabetic category standard letters basic written symbols graphemes consonants vowels encode based general principle letters letter pairgroups represent speech sounds syllabary symbol correlates syllable mora logography character represents word morpheme semantic units categories include abjads differ alphabets vowels indicated abugidas alphasyllabaries character representing consonant–vowel pairing alphabets typically 20to35 symbols fully express language whereas syllabaries 80to100 logographies several hundreds symbols
systems typically ordering symbol elements groups coded larger clusters like words acronyms generally lexemes giving rise many possibilities permutations meanings symbols convey systems also enable stringing together smaller groupings sometimes referred generic term character strings order enable full expression language reading step accomplished purely mind internal process expressed orally special symbols known punctuation used structure organization many writing systems used help capture nuances variations messages meaning communicated verbally cues timing tone accent inflection intonation writing system also typically method formatting recorded messages follows spoken versions rules like grammar syntax reader meaning intended message accurately preserved
writing systems preceded protowriting used pictograms ideograms mnemonic symbols protowriting lacked ability capture express full range thoughts ideas invention writing systems dates back beginning bronze late neolithic late millennium enabled accurate durable recording human history manner prone types error oral history vulnerable soon writing provided reliable form long distance communication advent publishing provided medium early form mass communication

languages wholly logographic writing systems many languages logograms good example modern western logograms hinduarabic numerals everyone uses symbols understands means whether calls eins ichi ehad jedan western logograms include ampersand used sign used many contexts percent sign many signs representing units currency
logograms sometimes called ideograms word refers symbols graphically represent abstract ideas linguists avoid chinese characters often semantic–phonetic compounds symbols include element represents meaning phonetic complement element represents pronunciation nonlinguists distinguish lexigraphy ideography symbols lexigraphies represent words symbols ideographies represent words morphemes

true syllabary systematic graphic similarity phonetically related characters though graphic similarity vowels characters similarity indicate common sound voiceless velar plosive recent creations cree syllabary embody system varying signs best seen arranging syllabogram onset–coda onset–rime table
syllabaries best suited languages relatively simple syllable structure japanese english language hand allows complex syllable structures relatively large inventory vowels complex consonant clusters making cumbersome write english words syllabary write english using syllabary every possible syllable english would separate symbol whereas number possible syllables japanese around english approximately 15000 16000
however syllabaries much larger inventories exist script example contains different symbols 1164 symbols particular tone diacritic counted separate syllables unicode chinese script used write middle chinese modern varieties chinese also represents syllables includes separate glyphs nearly many thousands syllables middle chinese however primarily represents morphemes includes different characters represent homophonous morphemes different meanings normally considered logographic script rather syllabary
