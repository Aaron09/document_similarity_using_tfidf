economic concept dates back adam smith idea obtaining larger production returns division labor1 diseconomies scale opposite
economies scale often limits passing optimum design point costs additional unit begin increase common limits include exceeding nearby material supply wood lumber pulp paper industry common limit cost unit weight commodities saturating regional market thus ship product uneconomical distances limits include using energy less efficiently higher defect rate
large producers usually efficient long runs product grade commodity find costly switch grades frequently therefore avoid specialty grades even though higher margins often smaller usually older manufacturing facilities remain viable changing commodity grade production specialty products23

overviewedit
simple meaning economies scale things efficiently increasing size speed operation4 economies scale often rely fixed cost constant dont vary output variable costs effected amount output wholesale retail distribution increasing speed operations order fulfillment lowers cost fixed working capital common sources economies scale purchasing bulk buying materials longterm contracts managerial increasing specialization managers financial obtaining lowerinterest charges borrowing banks access greater range financial instruments marketing spreading cost advertising greater range output media markets technological taking advantage returns scale production function factors reduces long average costs lrac production shifting shortrun average total cost sratc curve right
economies scale practical concept explain real world phenomena patterns international trade number firms market exploitation economies scale helps explain companies grow large industries also justification free trade policies since economies scale require larger market possible within particular country—for example would efficient liechtenstein maker sold local market lone maker profitable even exported cars global markets addition selling local market economies scale also play role natural monopoly distinction types economies scale internal external industry exhibits internal economy scale costs production falls number firms industry drops remaining firms increase production match previous levels conversely industry exhibits external economy scale costs drop introduction firms thus allowing efficient specialized services machinery
management thinker translator toyota production system service professor john seddon argues attempting create economies increasing scale powered myth service sector instead believes economies come improving flow service first receipt customer’s demand eventual satisfaction demand trying manage reduce unit costs firms often raise total costs creating failure demand seddon claims arguments economy scale plausibly obvious little hard data brought together produce broad assertions little hard factual evidence5

economies scale recognized engineering physical basis squarecube surface vessel increases square dimensions volume increases cube direct effect capital cost things buildings factories pipelines ships airplanes6
structural engineering strength beams increases cube thickness
drag loss vehicles like aircraft ships generally increases less proportional increasing cargo volume although physical details quite complicated therefore making larger usually results less fuel consumption cargo given speed
heat losses industrial processes vary unit volume pipes tanks vessels relationship somewhat similar squarecube law7
capital operating costedit
overall costs capital projects known subject economies scale crude estimate capital cost given sized piece equipment known changing size change capital cost power capacity ratio point power rule89
estimating capital cost typically requires insignificant amount labor possibly much materials install larger capacity electrical wire pipe significantly greater capacity10
cost unit capacity many types equipment electric motors centrifugal pumps diesel gasoline engines decreases size increases also efficiency increases size11
crew size operating costs ships trains airplanesedit
operating crew size ships airplanes trains increase direct proportion capacity12 operating crew consists pilots copilots navigators include passenger service personnel many aircraft models significantly lengthened stretched increase payload13
many manufacturing facilities especially making bulk materials like chemicals refined petroleum products cement paper labor requirements greatly influenced changes plant capacity labor requirements automated processes tend based complexity operation rather production rate many manufacturing facilities nearly basic number processing steps pieces equipment regardless production capacity

karl marx noted large scale manufacturing allowed economical products would otherwise waste14 marx cited chemical industry example today along petrochemicals remains highly dependent turning various residual reactant streams salable products pulp paper industry economical burn bark fine wood particles produce process steam recover spent pulping chemicals conversion back usable form
economies scale returns scaleedit
economies scale related easily confused theoretical economic notion returns scale economies scale refer firms costs returns scale describe relationship inputs outputs longrun inputs variable production function production function constant returns scale increasing inputs proportion results output increasing proportion returns decreasing doubling inputs results less double output increasing double output mathematical function used represent production function production function homogeneous returns scale represented degree homogeneity function homogeneous production functions constant returns scale first degree homogeneous increasing returns scale represented degrees homogeneity greater decreasing returns scale degrees homogeneity less
firm perfect competitor input markets thus perunit prices inputs unaffected much inputs firm purchases shown particular level output firm economies scale increasing returns scale diseconomies scale decreasing returns scale neither economies diseconomies scale constant returns scale151617 case perfect competition output market longrun equilibrium involve firms operating minimum point longrun average cost curves borderline economies diseconomies scale

literature assumed competitive nature reverse auctions order compensate lower prices lower margins suppliers seek higher volumes maintain increase total revenue buyers turn benefit lower transaction costs economies scale result larger volumes part result numerous studies indicated procurement volume must sufficiently high provide sufficient profits attract enough suppliers provide buyers enough savings cover additional costs18
however surprisingly enough shalev asbjornsen found research based reverse auctions conducted public sector public sector buyers higher auction volume economies scale lead better success auction found auction volume correlate competition number bidders suggesting auction volume promote additional competition noted however data included wide range products degree competition market varied significantly offer research issue conducted determine whether findings remain purchasing product small high volumes keeping competitive factors constant increasing auction volume increase competition18
distributional consequencesedit
1844 economic philosophic manuscripts karl marx observes economies scale historically associated increasing concentration private wealth used justify concentration marx points concentrated private ownership largescale economic enterprises historically contingent fact essential nature enterprises case agriculture example marx calls attention sophistical nature arguments used justify system concentrated ownership land

large landed property defenders always sophistically identified economic advantages offered largescale agriculture largescale landed property precisely result abolition property advantage thing received greatest possible extension another would social benefit19

instead concentrated private ownership land marx recommends economies scale instead realized associations

association applied land shares economic advantage largescale landed property first brings realization original tendency inherent landdivision namely equality association reestablishes rational basis longer mediated serfdom overlordship silly mysticism property intimate ties earth earth ceases object huckstering free labor free enjoyment becomes true personal property man19
