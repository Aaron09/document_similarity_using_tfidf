year president united states submits budget request congress following fiscal year required budget accounting 1921 current 1105a requires president submit budget earlier first monday january later first monday february typically presidents submit budgets first monday february budget submission delayed however presidents first year previous president belonged different party
federal budget calculated largely cash basis revenues outlays recognized transactions made therefore full longterm costs entitlement programs medicare social security federal portion medicaid reflected federal budget contrast many businesses national governments adopted forms accrual accounting recognizes obligations revenues incurred costs federal credit loan programs according provisions federal credit reform 1990 calculated present value basis8
federal agencies cannot spend money unless funds authorized appropriated typically separate congressional committees jurisdiction authorization appropriations house senate appropriations committees currently subcommittees responsible drafting regular appropriations bills determine amounts discretionary spending various federal programs appropriations bills must pass house senate signed president order give federal agencies legal budget authority spend9 many recent years regular appropriations bills combined omnibus bills

budget authority legal authority provided federal enter financial obligations result immediate future outlays involving federal government funds outlays refer issuance checks disbursement cash electronic transfer funds made liquidate federal obligation usually synonymous expenditure spending term appropriations refers budget authority incur obligations make payments treasury specified purposes military housing programs multiyear appropriations budget authority specified several coming fiscal years
congressional budgeting process authorization technically authorization provides legal authority executive branch establishes account receive money implement action sets limit much money expended however account remains empty congress approves appropriation requires treasury provide funds limit provided authorization congress required appropriate much money authorized10
congress authorize appropriate bill known authorization bills legislation usually provides multiyear authorization appropriation authorization bills particularly useful funding entitlement programs benefits federal says individual right regardless money appropriated estimating amount funds spent difficult authorization bills also useful giving federal agency right borrow money sign contracts provide loan guarantees 2007 twothirds federal spending came authorization bills11
backdoor authorization occurs appropriation made agency required spend money even authorizing legislation enacted backdoor appropriation occurs authorizing legislation requires agency spend specific amount money specific project within specific period time agency would violating required spend money—even appropriation made backdoor appropriations particularly vexsome removing appropriation requires amending federal often politically impossible within short period time backdoor authorizations appropriations sources significant friction congress authorization appropriations committees jealously guard legislative rights congressional budgeting process break committees overstep boundaries retaliated against12
