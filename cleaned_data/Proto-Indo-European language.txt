development theoryedit
direct evidence remains scholars reconstructed presentday descendants using comparative method4
comparative method follows neogrammarian rule indoeuropean sound laws apply without exception method compares languages uses sound laws find common ancestor example compare pairs words italian english piede foot padre father pesce fish since consistent correspondence initial consonants emerges frequently coincidental assume languages stem common parentlanguage5
many consider william jones anglowelsh philologist puisne judge bengal begun indoeuropean studies postulated common ancestry sanskrit latin greek6 although name closely associated observation first make 1500s european visitors indian subcontinent became aware similarities indoiranian languages european languages7 early 1653 marcus zuerius boxhorn published proposal protolanguage scythian following language families germanic romance greek baltic slavic celtic iranian8 memoir sent académie inscriptions belleslettres 1767 gastonlaurent coeurdoux french jesuit spent life india specifically demonstrated analogy sanskrit european languages9
many ways jones work less accurate predecessors erroneously included egyptian japanese chinese indoeuropean languages omitting hindi
1818 rasmus christian rask elaborated correspondences include indoeuropean languages sanskrit greek full range consonants involved 1816 franz bopp published system conjugation sanskrit investigated common origin sanskrit persian greek latin german 1833 began publishing comparative grammar sanskrit zend greek latin lithuanian slavic gothic german10
1822 jacob grimm formulated became known grimms general rule deutsche grammatik grimm showed correlations germanic indoeuropean languages demonstrated sound change affects entire language systematically words11 1870s neogrammarians proposed sound laws exceptions shown verners published 1876 resolved apparent exceptions grimms exploring role accent stress played language change12
august schleichers compendium comparative grammar indoeuropean sanskrit greek latin languages 1874–77 represented early attempt reconstruct protoindoeuropean language13
early 1900s indoeuropeanists developed welldefined descriptions scholars still accept today major developments since include discovery anatolian tocharian languages acceptance laryngeal theory theory aims produce greater regularity linguistic reconstruction protoindoeuropean phonology reconstruction generated comparative method

marginally attested languagesedit
lusitanian language marginally attested language found area modern portugal
paleobalkan languages occur near balkan peninsula appear members subfamilies poorly attested proper classification possible
phonologyedit
main article protoindoeuropean phonology
protoindoeuropean phonology reconstructed detail notable features widely accepted uncontroversial reconstruction include

three series stop consonants reconstructed voiceless voiced breathy voiced
sonorant consonants could used syllablically
three socalled laryngeal consonants whose exact pronunciation wellestablished believed existed part based visible effects adjacent sounds
fricative
fivevowel system frequently occurring vowels

protoindoeuropean accent reconstructed today variable lexical stress could appear syllable whose position often varied among different members paradigm singular plural verbal paradigm stressed syllables received higher pitch therefore often said pitch accent location stress associated ablaut variations especially normalgrade vowels zerograde lack vowel entirely predictable
accent best preserved vedic sanskrit case nouns ancient greek indirectly attested number phenomena languages account mismatches accent vedic sanskrit ancient greek well phenomena historical linguists prefer reconstruct tone language morpheme inherent tone sequence tones word evolved according hypothesis placement lexical stress different ways different branchescitation needed
morphologyedit
rootedit
protoindoeuropean roots affixlacking morphemes carried core lexical meaning word used derive related words friend english words befriend friends friend protoindoeuropean fusional language inflectional morphemes signalled grammatical relationships words dependence inflectional morphemes means roots unlike found english rarely found root plus suffix formed word stem word stem plus desinence usually ending formed word24
ablautedit
many morphemes protoindoeuropean short inherent vowel indoeuropean ablaut change short short long long vowel variation vowels occurred within inflectional morphology different grammatical forms noun verb different vowels derivational morphology verb associated abstract verbal noun different vowels25
categories distinguished ablaut often also identifiable contrasting endings loss endings later indoeuropean languages ablaut alone identify grammatical categories modern english words sing sang sung
nounedit
protoindoeuropean nouns declined eight nine cases26

nominative marks subject verb words follow linking verb rename subject verb also nominative case thus linguists nominative case linguists nominative dictionary form noun
accusative used direct object transitive verb
genitive marks noun modifying another noun
dative used indicate indirect object transitive verb jacob maria gave jacob drink
instrumental marks instrument means subject achieves accomplishes action either physical object abstract concept
ablative used express motion away something
locative corresponds vaguely english prepositions
vocative used word identifies addressee vocative expression direct address identity party spoken forth expressly within sentence example sentence dont know john john vocative expression indicates party addressed
allative used type locative case expresses movement towards something anatolian languages maintain case existed protoindoeuropean all27

three grammatical genders

masculine
feminine

pronounedit
protoindoeuropean pronouns difficult reconstruct owing variety later languages personal pronouns first second grammatical person third person demonstrative pronouns used instead personal pronouns unique forms endings distinct stems obvious first person singular stems still preserved english also varieties accusative genitive dative cases stressed enclitic form28

protoindoeuropean particles could used adverbs postpositions like postpositions became prepositions daughter languages reconstructible particles include negators conjunctions others interjection expression agony
syntaxedit
syntax older indoeuropean languages studied earnest since least late nineteenth century scholars hermann hirt berthold delbrück second half twentieth century interest topic increased reconstructions protoindoeuropean syntax31
since early attested languages inflectional thought relied primarily morphological markers rather word order signal syntactic relationships within sentences32 still default unmarked word order thought existed reconstructed jacob wackernagel subject–verb–object based evidence vedic sanskrit hypothesis still adherents 2015update broad consensus among scholars would subject–object–verb language33
default word order orders used express emphasis verb–subject–object emphasise verb attested indic iranian latin hittite traces found enclitic personal pronouns tocharian languages32 shift order posited occurred late since many descendant languages order modern greek romance albanian prefer insular celtic default order even anatolian languages show signs word order shift34 inconsistent order preference baltic slavic germanic attributed contact outside languages34
relationships language familiesedit
many hypothesised higherlevel relationships protoindoeuropean language families proposed highly controversial among

indouralic family encompassing uralic languages35
eurasiatic languages proposes link indoeuropean uralic altaic languages language families northern eurasia
protohuman language family linking languages together
pontic languages proposes association indoeuropean northwest caucasian languages
