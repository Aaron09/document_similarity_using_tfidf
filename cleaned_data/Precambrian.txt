hadean 4000–4600 term intended originally cover time preserved rocks deposited although zircon crystals 4400 demonstrate existence crust hadean records hadean time come moon meteorites12

proposed precambrian divided eons eras reflect stages planetary evolution rather current scheme based upon numerical ages system could rely events stratigraphic record demarcated gssps precambrian could divided five natural eons characterized follows13

accretion differentiation period planetary formation giant moonforming impact event
hadean dominated heavy bombardment possibly including cool early earth period late heavy bombardment period
archean period defined first crustal formations isua greenstone belt deposition banded iron formations increasing atmospheric oxygen content
transition period continued iron banded formation first continental beds
proterozoic period modern plate tectonics first animals
