history developmentedit
modern historical linguistics dates late 18th century grew earlier discipline philology3 study ancient texts documents dating back antiquity
first historical linguistics served cornerstone comparative linguistics primarily tool linguistic reconstruction scholars concerned chiefly establishing language families reconstructing prehistoric protolanguages using comparative method internal reconstruction focus initially wellknown indoeuropean languages many long written histories scholars also studied uralic languages another european language family less early written material exists since significant comparative linguistic work expanding outside european languages well austronesian languages various families native american languages among many others comparative linguistics however part broadly conceived discipline historical linguistics indoeuropean languages comparative study highly specialized field research carried subsequent development languages particular development modern standard varieties
scholars undertaken studies attempting establish superfamilies linking example indoeuropean uralic families nostratic attempts accepted widely information necessary establish relatedness becomes less available time depth increased timedepth linguistic methods limited chance word resemblances variations language groups limit around 10000 years often assumed6 dating various protolanguages also difficult several methods available dating approximate results obtained
diachronic synchronic analysisedit
also synchrony diachrony
initially modern linguistics historical orientation even study modern dialects involved looking origins ferdinand saussures distinction synchronic diachronic linguistics fundamental present organization discipline primacy accorded synchronic linguistics diachronic linguistics defined study successive synchronic stages saussures clear demarcation however defenders critics
linguistics synchronic analysis views linguistic phenomena given time usually present though synchronic analysis historical language form also possible distinguished diachronic regards phenomenon terms developments time diachronic analysis main concern historical linguistics however branches linguistics concerned form synchronic analysis study language change offers valuable insight state linguistic representation synchronic forms result historically evolving diachronic changes ability explain linguistic constructions necessitates focus diachronic processes7
practice purely synchronic linguistics possible period invention gramophone written records always behind speech reflecting linguistic developments written records difficult date accurately development modern title page often dating must rely contextual historical evidence inscriptions modern technology carbon dating used ascertain dates varying accuracy also work sociolinguists linguistic variation shown synchronic states uniform speech habits older younger speakers differ ways point language change synchronic variation linguistic change progress
synchronic diachronic approaches reach quite different conclusions example germanic strong verb like english sing sang sung irregular viewed synchronically native speakers brain processes learned forms whereas derived forms regular verbs processed quite differently application productive rules example adding basic form verb walk walked insight psycholinguistics relevant also language didactics synchronic disciplines however diachronic analysis show strong verb remnant fully regular system internal vowel changes case namely indoeuropean ablaut historical linguistics seldom uses category irregular verb
principal tools research diachronic linguistics comparative method method internal reconstruction lessstandard techniques mass lexical comparison used linguists overcome limitations comparative method linguists regard unreliable
findings historical linguistics often used basis hypotheses groupings movements peoples particularly prehistoric period practice however often unclear integrate linguistic evidence archaeological genetic evidence example numerous theories concerning homeland early movements protoindoeuropeans interpretation archaeological record
subfields studyedit




classification indoeuropean languages extinct languages white categories unattested protolanguages left half centum languages right half satem languages


comparative linguisticsedit
comparative linguistics originally comparative philology branch historical linguistics concerned comparing languages order establish historical relatedness languages related convergence borrowing genetic descent thus languages change also able crossrelate
genetic relatedness implies common origin protolanguage comparative linguistics goal constructing language families reconstructing protolanguages specifying changes resulted documented languages maintain clear distinction attested language reconstructed forms comparative linguists prefix asterisk form found surviving texts
etymologyedit
etymology study history words entered language source form meaning changed time word enter language loanword word language adopted speakers another language derivational morphology combining preexisting elements language hybrid processes called phonosemantic matching several minor ways
languages long detailed history etymology makes philology study words change culture culture time etymologists also apply methods comparative linguistics reconstruct information languages direct information writing known analyzing related languages technique known comparative method linguists make inferences shared parent language vocabulary word roots traced back origin instance indoeuropean language family found although originating philological tradition much current etymological research done language families little early documentation available uralic austronesian
dialectologyedit
main article dialectology
dialectology scientific study linguistic dialect varieties language characteristic particular groups based primarily geographic distribution associated features contrast variations based social factors studied sociolinguistics variations based time studied historical linguistics dialectology treats topics divergence local dialects common ancestor synchronic variation
dialectologists concerned grammatical features correspond regional areas thus usually dealing populations living specific locales generations without moving also immigrant groups bringing languages settlements
phonologyedit
main article sound change
phonology subfield linguistics studies sound system specific language languages whereas phonetics physical production perception sounds speech phonology describes sounds function within given language across languages
important part phonology studying sounds distinctive units within language example aspirated spin english sounds used complementary distribution used differentiate words considered allophones phoneme languages like thai quechua difference aspiration nonaspiration differentiates words sounds phones therefore considered phonemes
addition minimal meaningful sounds phonemes phonology studies sounds alternate english topics syllable structure stress accent intonation
principles phonological theory also applied analysis sign languages phonological units consist sounds principles phonological analysis applied independently modality designed serve general analytical tools languagespecific ones
morphologyedit
morphology study formal means expression language context historical linguistics formal means expression change time instance languages complex inflectional systems tend subject simplification process field studies internal structure words formal means expression8
words units lexicon subject matter lexicology words generally accepted clitics smallest units syntax clear languages words related words rules rules understood speaker reflect specific patterns regularities words formed smaller units smaller units interact speech morphology branch linguistics studies patterns wordformation within across languages attempts formulate rules model knowledge speakers languages context historical linguistics means expression change time grammaticalisation
syntaxedit
syntax study principles rules constructing sentences natural languages term syntax used refer directly rules principles govern sentence structure individual language syntax modern irish modern researchers syntax attempt describe languages terms rules many professionals discipline attempt find general rules apply natural languages context historical linguistics characteristics sentence structure related languages changed time grammaticalisation
rates change varieties adaptationedit
main article conservative language
studies historical linguistics often terms conservative innovative characterize extent change occurring particular language dialect compared related varieties particular conservative variety changes relatively less innovative variety variations plasticity often related socioeconomic situation language speakers example innovative language would american english language vast number speakers open interaction speakers language groups changes seen terms developed business marketing among fields technology converse innovative language conservative language generally defined static nature imperviousness outside influences languages spoken secluded areas lack primary language speaking population however guarantee descriptive terms carry value judgment linguistic studies used determine form worthiness language compared language
particularly conservative variety preserves features long since vanished elsewhere sometimes said archaic examples archaic language modern society survived phrases nursery rhymes
evolutionary contextedit
terms evolutionary theory historical linguistics opposed research origins human language studies lamarckian acquired characteristics languages9
