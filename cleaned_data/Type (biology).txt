although reality biologists examine many specimens available taxon writing official published species description nonetheless formal rules naming species international code zoological nomenclature single type must designated part published description
type description must include diagnosis typically discussion similarities differences closely related species indication type specimen specimens deposited examination geographical location type specimen originally found known type locality case parasites term type host symbiotype used indicate host organism type specimen obtained10
zoological collections maintained universities museums ensuring types kept good condition made available examination taxonomists important functions collections holotype designated type specimens following formally defined
holotypeedit
main article holotype
single specimen clearly designated original description specimen known holotype species holotype typically placed major museum similar wellknown public collection freely available later examination biologists
paratypeedit
main article paratype
original description designated holotype still additional specimens listed type series termed paratypes namebearing types
allotypeedit
allotype specimen opposite holotype designated among paratypes also formerly used specimen shows features seen holotype fossil11 term regulated iczn
neotypeedit
neotype specimen later selected serve single type specimen original holotype lost destroyed original author never cited specimen
syntypeedit
main article syntype
syntype specimens listed species description holotype designated historically syntypes often explicitly designated present iczn requirement modern attempts publish species description based syntypes generally frowned upon practicing taxonomists gradually replaced lectotypes still exist still considered namebearing types
lectotypeedit
lectotype specimen later selected serve single type specimen species originally described syntypes zoology lectotype kind namebearing type species originally described basis namebearing type consisting multiple specimens designated lectotype single namebearing type reduces potential confusion especially considering uncommon series syntypes contain specimens species
notable example carl linnaeus lectotype species homo sapiens12
paralectotypeedit
paralectotype additional specimen among syntypes lectotype designated among namebearing types13
hapantotypeedit
special case protistans type consists specimens directly related individuals representing distinct stages life cycle collectively treated single entity lectotypes cannot designated among
ergatotypeedit
ergatotype specimen selected represent worker member hymenopterans polymorphic castes11

formalisation type systemedit
various types listed necessarycitation needed many species described centuries single type specimen holotype often designated also types always carefully preserved intervening events wars fires resulted destruction original type material validity species name often rests upon availability original type specimens type cannot found never existed upon clarity description
iczn existed since 1961 first edition code published iczn always demand type specimen historical validity species many typeless species exist current edition code article prohibits designation neotype unless exceptional need clarifying taxonomic status species article
