chemotherapy often abbreviated chemo sometimes category cancer treatment uses anticancer drugs chemotherapeutic agents part standardized chemotherapy regimen chemotherapy given curative intent almost always involves combinations drugs prolong life reduce symptoms palliative chemotherapy chemotherapy major categories medical discipline specifically devoted pharmacotherapy cancer called medical oncology
common usage term chemotherapy come connote rather nonspecific intracellular poisons especially related inhibiting process cell division known mitosis generally excludes agents selectively block extracellular growth signals blockers signal transduction avoid connotations recently developed therapies specific molecular genetic targets inhibit growthpromoting signals coming classic endocrine hormones primarily estrogens breast cancer androgens prostate cancer called hormonal therapies inhibition growthpromoting influences especially associated receptor tyrosine kinases known targeted therapy
importantly drugs whether chemotherapy hormonal therapy targeted therapy constitutes systemic therapy cancer introduced blood stream therefore principle able address cancer anatomic location body systemic therapy often used conjunction modalities constitute local therapy treatments whose efficacy confined anatomic area applied cancer radiation therapy surgery hyperthermia therapy
traditional chemotherapeutic agents cytotoxic means interfering cell division mitosis cancer cells vary widely susceptibility agents large extent chemotherapy thought damage stress cells lead cell death apoptosis initiated many side effects chemotherapy traced damage normal cells divide rapidly thus sensitive antimitotic drugs cells bone marrow digestive tract hair follicles results common sideeffects chemotherapy myelosuppression decreased production blood cells hence also immunosuppression mucositis inflammation lining digestive tract alopecia hair loss effect immune cells especially lymphocytes chemotherapy drugs often find host diseases result harmful overactivity immune system self socalled autoimmunity include rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus multiple sclerosis vasculitis many others

number strategies administration chemotherapeutic drugs used today chemotherapy given curative intent prolong life palliate symptoms

induction chemotherapy first line treatment cancer chemotherapeutic drug type chemotherapy used curative intent355–59
combined modality chemotherapy drugs cancer treatments surgery radiation therapy hyperthermia therapy
consolidation chemotherapy given remission order prolong overall diseasefree time improve overall survival drug administered drug achieved remission355–59
intensification chemotherapy identical consolidation chemotherapy different drug induction chemotherapy used355–59
combination chemotherapy involves treating patient number different drugs simultaneously drugs differ mechanism sideeffects biggest advantage minimising chances resistance developing agent also drugs often used lower doses reducing toxicity355–59417–182
neoadjuvant chemotherapy given prior local treatment surgery designed shrink primary tumor355–59 also given cancers high risk micrometastatic disease542
adjuvant chemotherapy given local treatment radiotherapy surgery used little evidence cancer present risk recurrence355–59 also useful killing cancerous cells spread parts body micrometastases treated adjuvant chemotherapy reduce relapse rates caused disseminated cells6
maintenance chemotherapy repeated lowdose treatment prolong remission2355–59
salvage chemotherapy palliative chemotherapy given without curative intent simply decrease tumor load increase life expectancy regimens general better toxicity profile expected355–59

chemotherapy regimens require patient capable undergoing treatment performance status often used measure determine whether patient receive chemotherapy whether dose reduction required fraction cells tumor treatment fractional kill repeated doses must administered continue reduce size tumor7 current chemotherapy regimens apply drug treatment cycles frequency duration treatments limited toxicity patient8

dosageedit




dose response relationship cell killing chemotherapeutic drugs normal cancer cells high doses percentage normal cancer cells killed similar reason doses chosen antitumour activity exceeds normal cell death1


dosage chemotherapy difficult dose ineffective tumor whereas excessive doses toxicity sideeffects intolerable patient1 standard method determining chemotherapy dosage based calculated body surface area usually calculated mathematical formula nomogram using patients weight height rather direct measurement body area formula originally derived 1916 study attempted translate medicinal doses established laboratory animals equivalent doses humans13 study included human subjects14 chemotherapy introduced 1950s formula adopted official standard chemotherapy dosing lack better option1516
recently validity method calculating uniform doses questioned reason formula takes account individuals weight height drug absorption clearance influenced multiple factors including gender metabolism disease state organ function drugtodrug interactions genetics obesity major impact actual concentration drug patients bloodstream151718 result high variability systemic chemotherapy drug concentration among patients dosed variability demonstrated 10fold many drugs1419 words patients receive dose given drug based concentration drug bloodstream patient times higher lower compared patient19 variability typical many chemotherapy drugs dosed shown demonstrated study common chemotherapy drugs14




dose management results significantly better response survival rates versus dosing20


result pharmacokinetic variability among patients many patients receive right dose achieve optimal treatment effectiveness minimized toxic side effects patients overdosed others underdosed15171820212223 example randomized clinical trial investigators found metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated 5fluorouracil receive optimal therapeutic dose dosed standard—68 underdosed overdosed20
recent controversy calculate chemotherapy doses obese patients24 higher clinicians often arbitrarily reduce dose prescribed formula fear overdosing24 many cases result suboptimal treatment24
several clinical studies demonstrated chemotherapy dosing individualized achieve optimal systemic drug exposure treatment outcomes improved toxic side effects reduced2022 clinical study cited patients whose dose adjusted achieve predetermined target exposure realized improvement treatment response rate sixmonth improvement overall survival compared dosed bsa20




dose management avoids serious side effects experienced dosing20









dose management folfox regimen increases treatment response significantly improves survival months22



study investigators compared incidence common 5fuassociated grade toxicities doseadjusted patients bsadosed patients20 incidence debilitating grades diarrhea reduced bsadosed group doseadjusted group patients serious hematologic side effects eliminated20 reduced toxicity doseadjusted patients able treated longer periods time20 bsadosed patients treated total months doseadjusted patients treated total months20 completing course treatment important factor achieving better treatment outcomes
similar results found study involving colorectal cancer patients treated popular folfox regimen22 incidence serious diarrhea reduced bsadosed group patients doseadjusted group incidence severe mucositis reduced 0822
folfox study also demonstrated improvement treatment outcomes22 positive response increased bsadosed patients doseadjusted group median progression free survival overall survival improved months dose adjusted group22
approach help clinicians individualize chemotherapy dosing measure drug levels blood plasma time adjust dose according formula algorithm achieve optimal exposure established target exposure optimized treatment effectiveness minimized toxicities dosing personalized achieve target exposure optimal results patient algorithm used clinical trials cited resulted significantly improved treatment outcomes
