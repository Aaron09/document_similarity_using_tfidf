idea central asia distinct region world introduced 1843 geographer alexander humboldt borders central asia subject multiple definitions historically built political geography geoculture significant parameters widely used scholarly literature definitions central asia16
limited definition official soviet union defined middle asia consisting solely uzbekistan turkmenistan tajikistan kyrgyzstan definition also often used outside ussr period
however russian culture distinct terms средняя азия srednyaya aziya middle asia narrower definition includes traditionally nonslavic central asian lands incorporated within borders historical russia центральная азия tsentralnaya aziya central asia wider definition includes central asian lands never part historical russia
soon independence leaders four former soviet central asian republics tashkent declared definition central asia include kazakhstan well original four included soviets since become common definition central asia
unesco history civilizations central asia published 1992 defines region afghanistan northeastern iran pakistan northern india western china mongolia former soviet central asian republics17
