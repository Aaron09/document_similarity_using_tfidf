extinction parent species daughter species subspecies still extant called pseudoextinction phyletic extinction effectively taxon vanishes transformed anagenesis successor19 split cladogenesis20
pseudoextinction difficult demonstrate unless strong chain evidence linking living species members preexisting species example sometimes claimed extinct hyracotherium early horse shares common ancestor modern horse pseudoextinct rather extinct several extant species equus including zebra donkey however fossil species typically leave genetic material behind cannot whether hyracotherium evolved modern horse species merely evolved common ancestor modern horses pseudoextinction much easier demonstrate larger taxonomic groups

assessing relative importance genetic factors compared environmental ones causes extinction compared debate nature nurture25 question whether extinctions fossil record caused evolution catastrophe subject discussion mark newman author modeling extinction argues mathematical model falls positions4 contrast conservation biology uses extinction vortex model classify extinctions cause concerns human extinction raised example martin rees 2003 book final hour concerns effects climate change technological disaster

genetics demographic phenomenaedit
also extinction vortex genetic erosion mutational meltdown
adaptation increasing population fitness slower environmental degradation plus accumulation slightly deleterious mutations population extinct28 smaller populations fewer beneficial mutations entering population generation slowing adaptation also easier slightly deleterious mutations small populations resulting positive feedback loop small population size fitness cause mutational meltdown
limited geographic range important determinant genus extinction background rates becomes increasingly irrelevant mass extinction arises29 limited geographic range cause small population size greater vulnerability local environmental catastrophes
extinction rates affected population size factor affects evolvability including balancing selection cryptic genetic variation phenotypic plasticity robustness diverse deep gene pool gives population higher chance short term surviving adverse change conditions effects cause reward loss genetic diversity increase chances extinction species population bottlenecks dramatically reduce genetic diversity severely limiting number reproducing individuals make inbreeding frequent
genetic pollutionedit
main article genetic pollution
purebred wild species evolved specific ecology threatened extinction30 process genetic pollution—ie uncontrolled hybridization introgression genetic swamping leads homogenization outcompetition introduced hybrid species31 endemic populations face extinctions populations imported selectively bred people habitat modification brings previously isolated species contact extinction likeliest rare species coming contact abundant ones32 interbreeding swamp rarer gene pool create hybrids depleting purebred gene pool example endangered wild water buffalo threatened extinction genetic pollution abundant domestic water buffalo extinctions always apparent morphological nongenetic observations degree gene flow normal evolutionarily process nevertheless hybridization without introgression threatens rare species existence3334
gene pool species population variety genetic information living members large gene pool extensive genetic diversity associated robust populations survive bouts intense selection meanwhile genetic diversity inbreeding population bottlenecks reduces range adaptions possible35 replacing native alien genes narrows genetic diversity within original population3236 thereby increasing chance extinction

main article habitat destruction
habitat degradation currently main anthropogenic cause species extinctions main cause habitat degradation worldwide agriculture urban sprawl logging mining fishing practices close behind degradation species habitat alter fitness landscape extent species longer able survive becomes extinct occur direct effects environment becoming toxic indirectly limiting species ability compete effectively diminished resources competitor species
habitat degradation toxicity kill species rapidly killing living members contamination sterilizing also occur longer periods lower toxicity levels affecting life span reproductive capacity competitiveness
habitat degradation also take form physical destruction niche habitats widespread destruction tropical rainforests replacement open pastureland widely cited example this13 elimination dense forest eliminated infrastructure needed many species survive example fern depends dense shade protection direct sunlight longer survive without forest shelter another example destruction ocean floors bottom trawling37
diminished resources introduction competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation global warming allowed species expand range bringing unwelcomeaccording competition species previously occupied area sometimes competitors predators directly affect prey species times merely outcompete vulnerable species limited resources vital resources including water food also limited habitat degradation leading extinction
