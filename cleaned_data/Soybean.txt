soybeans processed foods among richest foods total phytoestrogens basis present primarily form isoflavones daidzein genistein164 compared human breast milk formula diets contain isoflavone levels 0005001 mgday soybased infant formulas contain isoflavone levels 6–47 mgday constitute several orders magnitude greater receive sources nutrition165
breast canceredit
although considerable research examined potential consumption lower risk breast cancer women assessment studies indicates insufficient population evidence make conclusion relationship 2016137
2001 literature review suggested women current past breast cancer aware risks potential tumor growth taking products based effect phytoestrogens promote breast cancer cell growth animals166 2006 commentary reviewed relationship breast cancer stating decrease risk breast cancer cautioned impact isoflavones breast tissue needs evaluated cellular level women high risk breast cancer167
high consumption omega6 polyunsaturated fatty acids found types vegetable including soybean increase likelihood postmenopausal women develop breast cancer168 another analysis suggests inverse association total polyunsaturated fatty acid intake breast cancer risk169
2011 analysis literature said study suggests isoflavones intake associated significant reduced risk breast cancer incidence asian populations western populations170
prostate canceredit
phytoestrogen content studies suggested soybean ingestion influence testosterone levels however 2010 metaanalysis placebo controlled studies showed neither foods isoflavone supplements alter measures bioavailable testosterone estrogen concentrations men171 hypothesized foods enterolactone increase development prostate cancer although significant associations observed isoflavones172 furthermore consumption shown effect levels quality sperm173 2009 metaanalysis research association consumption prostate cancer risk concluded consumption foods associated reduction prostate cancer risk men174
brainedit
mixed results animal studies epidemiological studies relatively definitive expensive controlled study impacts cognitive skills performed found impact
though evidence estrogen help protect repair brain injury rats175 also evidence phytoestrogens harmful recovery rats situations176 sustained brain injury
similarly epidemiological evidence humans eating soya products currently divided study japanese 1965 1999 demonstrated positive correlation brain atrophy consumption tofu meals177
2001 literature review noted disturbing data soys effect cognitive function elderly existed178 2008 epidemiological study indonesian elderly individuals found tofu intake associated worse memory tempeh fermented product intake associated better memory179
cover article center science public interests september 2014 newsletter reported controlled study prompted suggestive epidemiological evidence found impact cognitive skills years milk protein diet enrichment180
carcinogenicityedit
though flour known correlated pancreatic cancer rats181 cooked flour found carcinogenic182183 whether might promote pancreatic cancer humans unknown studies attempted single intake incidence pancreatic cancer humans amount rats proportionately larger humans would normally consume however isoflavone genistein suggested chemopreventive agent pancreatic cancer interfering chemical pathways promote creation growth tumors184
cancer council south wales australia released statement saying scientific research suggests overall moderate consumption products appear present risk women breast cancer equivocal evidence consuming large amounts products protective effect developing breast prostate cancer however council recommend taking dietary supplements evidence either effective safe preventing treating cancers
