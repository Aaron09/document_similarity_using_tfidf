music historians believe perfectly accurate gauge popular songs week year example 1950s 1960s payola problems skewed numbers largely undetectable ways11
history popular music shows nearly many remarkable failures chart impressive charting histories certain artists pink floyd zeppelin tremendous album sales oblivious weekly singles charts business changes industry also affect artists statistical records single releases frequent steady expected much shorter shelf lives earlier decades making direct historical comparisons somewhat specious singles billboard chart weeks since 1955 released 1992 first years rock song ever debuted number since 1995 change methodology songs
strategizing also plays role numerous record labels taken deliberate steps maximize chart positions tactics timing singles debut face weakest possible competition massively discounting price singles point individual sale represented financial loss meanwhile labels would deliberately withhold even marketable songs order boost album sales particularly 1990s many heavily played radio hits unavailable separate purchase countervailing strategies cannot said chart necessarily lists countrys popular successful songs strategies like main reason behind december 1998 change charts
criticswho argued overemphasis limited number singles distorted record industry development efforts nearly many critics supporters criticisms however becoming less less germane digital downloads revitalized concept “singles sales”
billboard charts endured widely circulated published report songs popular across united states last halfcentury competing publications cash record world radio records recently mediabase offered alternate charts sometimes differed widely
