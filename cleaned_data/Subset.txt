propertyedit



finite subset included denoted








displaystyle asubseteq




cardinality intersection equal cardinality

formally





























displaystyle asubseteq bleftrightarrow acap



symbolsedit
authors symbols indicate subset superset respectively meaning instead symbols example authors true every
authors prefer symbols indicate proper subset proper superset instead usage makes analogous inequality symbols example equal definitely equal less similarly using convention proper subset equal definitely equal
examplesedit




regular polygons form subset polygons



proper subset thus expressions true
subset thus true true false
subset proper subset true false
empty denoted also subset given also always proper subset except
prime number greater proper subset number greater
natural numbers proper subset rational numbers likewise points line segment proper subset points line examples subset whole infinite subset cardinality concept corresponds size number elements finite whole cases counter ones initial intuition
rational numbers proper subset real numbers example sets infinite latter larger cardinality power former
