international telecommunications union defines radio communication station «one transmitters receivers combination transmitters receivers including accessory equipment necessary location carrying radio communication service radio astronomy service station shall classified service operates permanently temporarily»2
equipment radio stationedit

transmitter takes electrical output microphone modulates higherfrequency carrier signal transmits radio waves
receiver broadcast message received receiver decodes radio sine waves
antenna antenna required transmission also required receive radio waves main antenna send radio signals aerial feeder system feeding hfenergy power antenna
transmission lines transmission lines used transfer radio signals location another example transmission line used luftwaffe germany send information camps back base
connectors interface panel remote control used connect various different types equipment used radio station input broadcast data transmitter interface panel need used
cable cable used connect various devices
equipment rack hold equipment secure logical manner equipment rack used
power protection equipment holding equipments stable secure logical manner
uninterrupted power supply3

broadcastingedit
broadcasting stations operate frequency band allocated broadcasting service range primary basis particular broadcasting channels line regional national frequency allotment plans subject frequency coordination interference criteria established radio regulations mandatory highest quality reception might achieved frequency assignment within responsibility competent national frequency assignment authority

power broadcasting

power broadcasting station also power radio operated power 100w cover service radius miles geographical normally broadcasts educational content allowed undertake commercial operations
broadcastingedit
lower transmission frequency sound broadcasting stations also radio greater geographical area covered lower quality reception typical radio stations broadcast frequencies 1605
radio reception faces high interference radiocommunication services allocated particular frequency band local broadcasts similar frequencies usually originating countries broadcasting transmitter needs massive infrastructure investment usually including cost hiring crossborder frequency coordination comply countrys regulations
internet radioedit
