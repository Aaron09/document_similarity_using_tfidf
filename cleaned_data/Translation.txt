fidelity extent translation accurately renders meaning source text without distortion

transparency extent translation appears native speaker target language originally written language conforms grammar syntax idiom john dryden 1631–1700 writes preface translation anthology sylvae

taken away original authors expressions shorter possibly consideration beautiful greek latin would appear shining english enlargd desire false criticks would always think thoughts wholly mine either secretly poet fairly deducd least considerations fail piece living englishman woud probably written30

translation meets criterion fidelity faithfulness said faithful translation meets criterion transparency idiomatic depending given translation qualities mutually exclusive
criteria judging fidelity translation vary according subject type text literary qualities social historical context




friedrich schleiermacher


criteria judging transparency translation appear straightforward unidiomatic translation sounds wrong extreme case wordforword translations generated many machinetranslation systems often results patent nonsense
nevertheless certain contexts translator consciously seek produce literal translation translators literary religious historic texts often adhere closely possible source text stretching limits target language produce unidiomatic text translator adopt expressions source language order provide local color
current western translation practice dominated dual concepts fidelity transparency always case however periods especially preclassical rome 18th century many translators stepped beyond bounds translation proper realm adaptation




lawrence venuti
