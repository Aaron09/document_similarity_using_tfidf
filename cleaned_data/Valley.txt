hanging valley tributary valley higher main valley commonly associated ushaped valleys tributary glacier flows glacier larger volume main glacier erodes deep ushaped valley nearly vertical sides tributary glacier smaller volume makes shallower ushaped valley since surfaces glaciers originally elevation shallower valley appears hanging main valley often waterfalls form near outlet upper valley4
hanging valleys also occur fjord systems water branches sognefjord instance much shallower main fjord mouth fjærlandsfjord meters deep main fjord 1200 meters nearby mouth ikjefjord meters deep main fjord around 1300 meters point5
glaciated terrain site hanging streams valleys hanging valleys also simply product varying rates erosion main valley tributary valleys varying rates erosion associated composition adjacent rocks different valley locations tributary valleys eroded deepened glaciers erosion slower rate main valley floor thus difference valleys depth increases time tributary valley composed resistant rock hangs main valley6
troughshaped valleysedit
troughshaped valleys also form regions heavy denudation contrast glacial ushaped valleys less downward sideways erosion severe slope denudation results gently sloping valley sides transition actual valley bottom unclear troughshaped valleys occur mainly periglacial regions tropical regions variable wetness climates dominated heavy denudation
valleysedit
valleys wide relatively level floors steep sides common periglacial areas occur midlatitudes also occur tropical arid regions7
