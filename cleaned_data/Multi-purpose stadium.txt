however even areas amount compromise needed accommodate multiple sports varies considerably outdoor team sports rectangular playing field cricket australianrules fields rounded baseball played diamond makes much harder accommodate within rectangularshaped stadium likewise accommodating athletics track field summer olympics means constructing rounded 400m track around infield often means sports simply find easier play separate stadiums
case ireland grounds built gaelic games physically capable hosting association football rugby codes without changing seating configuration gaelic games pitch rectangular also longer wider football either rugby code changes required physical goals field markings however opposition sports within large parts gaelic games community notably manifested rule means football rugby clubs generally play separate grounds
