theoretical approaches immune systemedit
immunology strongly experimental everyday practice also characterized ongoing theoretical attitude many theories suggested immunology nineteenth century present time 19th century beginning 20th century battle cellular humoral theories immunity according cellular theory immunity represented particular elie metchnikoff cells precisely phagocytes responsible immune responses contrast humoral theory immunity held among others robert koch emil behring stated active immune agents soluble components molecules found organism’s “humors” rather cells143144145
