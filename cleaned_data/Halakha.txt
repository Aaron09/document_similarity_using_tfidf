foundational talmudic literature especially mishna babylonian talmud commentaries

antiquity sanhedrin functioned essentially supreme court legislature judicial system judaism power administer binding including received rabbinic decrees jews—rulings sanhedrin became halakha oral court ceased function full mode today authoritative application jewish left local rabbi local rabbinical courts local applicability branches judaism follow halakha individuals make numerous adhoc decisions regarded authority decide certain issues definitively
since days sanhedrin however body authority generally regarded authority create universally recognized precedents result halakha developed somewhat different fashion angloamerican legal systems supreme court able provide universally accepted precedents generally halakhic arguments effectively unofficially peerreviewed rabbinic posek literally makes statement decisor proposes additional interpretation interpretation considered binding poseks questioner immediate community depending stature posek quality decision interpretation also gradually accepted rabbis members jewish communities

notwithstanding potential innovation rabbis jewish communities differ greatly make changes halakha notably poskim frequently extend application situations consider applications constituting change halakha example many orthodox rulings concerning electricity derived rulings concerning fire closing electrical circuit cause spark contrast conservative poskim consider switching electrical equipment physically chemically like turning water permissible halakha lighting fire permissible therefore permitted shabbat reformative judaism cases explicitly interprets halakha take account view contemporary society instance conservative rabbis extend application certain jewish obligations permissible activities women halakha viewed today
