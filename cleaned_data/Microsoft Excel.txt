using windows applications
windows applications microsoft access microsoft word well excel communicate others capabilities common dynamic data exchange although strongly deprecated microsoft common method send data applications running windows official publications referring protocol hell29 name suggests allows applications supply data others calculation display common financial markets used connect important financial data services bloomberg reuters
object linking embedding allows windows application control another enable format calculate data take form embedding application uses another handle task suited example powerpoint presentation embedded excel spreadsheet vice versa30313233
using external data
excel users access external data sources microsoft office features example connections built office data connection file format excel files updated using microsoft supplied odbc driver
excel accept data real time several programming interfaces allow communicate many data sources bloomberg reuters addins power plus

dynamic data exchange uses message passing mechanism windows allow data flow excel applications although easy users create links programming links reliably difficult microsoft creators system officially refer protocol hell29 spite many issues remains common data reach traders financial markets
network extended protocol allow spreadsheets different computers exchange data starting windows vista microsoft longer supports facility34
real time data although many ways technically superior slow gain acceptance since requires nontrivial programming skills first released neither adequately documented supported major data vendors3536

alternatively microsoft query provides odbcbased browsing within microsoft excel373839

password protection
main article microsoft office password protection
microsoft excel protection offers several types passwords

password open document
password modify document
password unprotect worksheet
password protect workbook
password protect sharing workbook

passwords except password open document removed instantly regardless microsoft excel version used create document types passwords used primarily shared work document passwordprotected documents encrypted data sources password saved document’s header password protect workbook exception document encrypted standard password “velvetsweatshop” since known public actually extra protection document type password prevent trespasser gaining access document password open document cryptographic strength kind protection depends strongly microsoft excel version used create document
microsoft excel earlier versions password open converted 16bit instantly cracked excel 972000 password converted 40bit also cracked quickly using modern equipment regards services rainbow tables passwordfind takes several seconds remove protection addition passwordcracking programs bruteforce attack passwords rate hundreds thousands passwords second lets decrypt document also find original password
excel 2003xp encryption slightly better user choose encryption algorithm available system cryptographic service provider excel file cant decrypted thus password open cant removed though bruteforce attack speed remains quite high nevertheless older excel 972000 algorithm default43 therefore users changed default settings lack reliable protection documents
situation changed fundamentally excel 2007 modern algorithm bits started used decryption 50000fold hash function sha1 reduced speed bruteforce attacks hundreds passwords second excel 2010 strength protection default increased times 100000fold sha1 convert password

quirks
information spreadsheet shortcomings
errors specific excel include misleading statistics functions function errors date limitations excel 2007 error46
statistical functions
accuracy convenience statistical tools excel criticized4748495051 mishandling missing data returning incorrect values inept handling roundoff large numbers selectively updating calculations spreadsheet cell values changed limited statistical tools microsoft announced issues addressed excel 201052
excel function error
excel issues modulo operations case excessively large results excel return error warning instead answer5354
fictional leap year 1900
excel includes february 1900 incorrectly treating 1900 leap year even though 2100 correctly treated regular year5556 originated lotus deliberately implemented save computer memory also purposely implemented excel purpose compatibility57 legacy later carried office open file format58
thus necessarily whole number greater equal interpreted date time real number days december 1899 nonnegative number less number days december 1899 numbers whole part represent fictional
date range
excel supports dates years range 19009999 except december 1899 entered displayed 0jan1900
converting fraction hours minutes days treating moment january 1900 work negative fraction59
conversion problems
entering text happens form interpreted date text unintentionally changed standard date format similar problem occurs text happens form floating point notation number cases original exact text cannot recovered result case entering gene names well known problem analysis example bioinformatics problem first described 20046061
filenames
microsoft excel open documents name instead display following error

document name already open cannot open documents name even documents different folders open second document either close document currently open rename documents62

reason calculation ambiguity linked cells cell book1xlsxsheet1g33 books named book1 open tell user means63
numeric precision
main article numeric precision microsoft excel




excel maintains figures numbers always accurate bottom line line


despite 15figure precision excel display many figures thirty upon user request displayed figures actually used computations example difference numbers differ difference displayed values although departures usually beyond 15th decimal exceptions occur especially large small numbers serious errors occur decisions made based upon automated comparisons numbers example using excel function equality numbers unpredictablecitation needed
figure fraction 19000 displayed excel although number decimal representation infinite string ones excel displays leading figures second line number added fraction excel displays figures third line subtracted using excel second line eleven decimal difference subtracted displayed value three followed string eleven however difference reported excel third line three followed string thirteen extra erroneous digits excel calculates half digit displays
excel works modified 1985 version ieee specification64 excels implementation involves conversions binary decimal representations leading accuracy average better would expect simple fifteen digit precision worse main article details
besides accuracy user computations question accuracy excelprovided functions raised particularly arena statistical functions excel criticized sacrificing accuracy speed calculation6566
many calculations excel executed using additional issue accuracy varies variable type userrequested precision67
content type autodetection
2004 scientists reported automatic inadvertent conversion gene nomenclature dates60 followup study 2016 found many peer reviewed scientific journal papers affected selected journals proportion published articles excel files containing gene lists affected gene name errors excel parses copied pasted data sometimes changes depending thinks example march1 membrane associated ringchtype finger gets converted date march 1mar sept2 septin converted september 2sep etc68 secondary news sources69 reported fault excel original authors 2016 paper placed blame researchers misusing excel6170
