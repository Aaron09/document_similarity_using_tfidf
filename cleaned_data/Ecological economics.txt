wellbeing ecological economics also differentiated welfare found mainstream economics welfare economics 1930s informs resource environmental economics entails limited preference utilitarian conception value nature valuable economies people services clean clean water encounters wilderness
ecological economics distinguishable neoclassical economics primarily assertion economy embedded within environmental system ecology deals energy matter transactions life earth human economy definition contained within system ecological economists argue neoclassical economics ignored environment best considering subset human economy

weak versus strong sustainabilityedit
main article weak strong sustainability
also nicholas georgescuroegen criticising neoclassical economics weak versus strong sustainability








three nested systems sustainability economy wholly contained society wholly contained biophysical environment clickable


ecological economics challenges conventional approach towards natural resources claiming undervalues natural capital considering interchangeable humanmade capital—labor technology

potential substitution manmade capital natural capital important debate ecological economics economics sustainability continuum views among economists strongly neoclassical positions robert solow martin weitzman extreme entropy pessimists notably nicholas georgescuroegen herman daly other46
neoclassical economists tend maintain manmade capital principle replace types natural capital known weak sustainability view essentially every technology improved upon replaced innovation substitute scarce materials
extreme strong sustainability view argues stock natural resources ecological functions irreplaceable premises strong sustainability follows economic policy fiduciary responsibility greater ecological world sustainable development must therefore take different approach valuing natural resources ecological functions
recently stanislav shmelev developed methodology assessment progress macro scale based multicriteria methods allows consideration different perspectives including strong weak sustainability conservationists industrialists aims search middle providing strong neokeynsian economic push without putting excessive pressure natural resources including water producing emissions directly indirectly47

energy accounting balanceedit
also energy gain
energy balance used track energy system useful tool determining resource environmental impacts using first second laws thermodynamics determine much energy needed point system form energy cost various environmental issuescitation needed energy accounting system keeps track energy energy nonuseful energy versus work done transformations within system53

externalities cost shiftingedit
ecological economics founded upon view neoclassical economics assumption environmental community costs benefits mutually canceling externalities warranted joan martinez alier67 instance shows bulk consumers automatically excluded impact upon prices commodities consumers future generations born assumptions behind future discounting assume future goods cheaper present goods criticized david pearce68 recent stern report although stern report employ discounting criticized reasons ecological economists clive spash69
concerning externalities like ecobusinessman paul hawken argue orthodox economic line reason goods produced unsustainably usually cheaper goods produced sustainably hidden subsidy paid nonmonetized human environment community future generations70 arguments developed hawken amory hunter lovins promote vision environmental capitalist utopia natural capitalism creating next industrial revolution71
contrast ecological economists like joan martinezalier appeal different line reasoning72 rather assuming form capitalism best forward older ecological economic critique questions idea internalizing externalities providing corrective current system work karl william kapp explains concept externality misnomer73 fact modern business enterprise operates basis shifting costs onto others normal practice make profits74 charles einsentein argued method privatising profits socialising costs externalities passing costs community natural environment future generations inherently destructive75 social ecological economist clive spash noted externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental social problems minor aberrations otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system76 internalizing externality nothing address structural systemic problem fails recognize pervasive nature supposed externalities

criticismedit
assigning monetary value natural resources biodiversity emergent ecosystem services often viewed process influencing economic practices policy decisionmaking8384 idea becoming accepted among ecologists conservationist argue inherently false
mccauley argues ecological economics resulting ecosystem service based conservation harmful85 describes four main problems approach
firstly seems assumed ecosystem services financially beneficial undermined basic characteristic ecosystems specifically favour single species certain services might useful coastal protection hurricanes mangroves example others might cause financial personal harm wolves hunting cattle86 complexity ecosystems makes challenging weigh value given species wolves play critical role regulating prey populations absence apex predator scottish highlands caused population deer preventing afforestation increases risk flooding damage property
secondly allocating monetary value nature would make conservation reliant markets fluctuate lead devaluation services previously considered financially beneficial case bees forest near former coffee plantations finca santa costa rica pollination services valued us60000 year soon study coffee prices dropped fields replanted pineapple87 pineapple require bees pollinated value service dropped zero
thirdly conservation programmes sake financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity invent replace ecosystem services artificial means mccauley argues proposals deemed short lifespan history technology humanity developed artificial alternatives nature’s services time passing cost services tend decrease would also lead devaluation ecosystem services
lastly assumed conserving ecosystems always financially beneficial opposed alteration case introduction nile perch lake victoria ecological consequence decimation native fauna however event praised local communities gain significant financial benefits trading fish
mccauley argues reasons trying convince decisionmakers conserve nature monetary reasons path followed instead appealing morality ultimate campaign protection nature
