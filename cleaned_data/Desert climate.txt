regions desert climates


desert climates typically found subtropical ridge largely unbroken sunshine whole year stable descending high pressure aloft areas located degrees south degrees north latitude subtropical latitudes called horse latitudes desert climates generally sunny yearround rise higher latitude southwestern united states sheltered regions warmed winters pacific ocean enabling searing summer temperatures death valley basin degrees latitude desert climates also reach similar latitudes middle east north africa coastal south eastern areas spain
desert climates usually feature sometimes exceptionally periods year many locations featuring desert climate maximum temperatures uncommon summer soar hottest regions world absolute heat records generally deserts heat potential highest planet desert locations consistently experience high temperatures year long even wintertime locations feature highest annual average temperatures recorded earth averages exceed last feature seen sections africa arabia colder periods year nighttime temperatures drop freezing exceptional radiation loss clear skies however rarely temperatures drop freezing

regions cold desert climates


cold desert climates usually feature warm instances summers though summers typically desert climates unlike desert climates cold desert climates tend feature cold winters snow tends rare regions climate gobi desert mongolia classic example cold deserts though summer shares cold winters rest central asia cold desert climates typically found higher altitudes desert climates usually drier desert climates
cold desert climates typically located temperate zones usually rain shadow high mountains restrict precipitation westerly winds example patagonian desert argentina bounded andes west case central asia mountains restrict precipitation monsoon kyzyl taklamakan katpana desert deserts central asia drier portions great basin desert western united states major examples climates ladakh region city great himalayas india also cold desert climate also found europe primarily bardenas reales near tudela navarre high altitude parts tabernas desert almería spain
arctic antarctic regions also receive little precipitation year owing exceptionally cold however generally classified polar climates average summer temperatures
