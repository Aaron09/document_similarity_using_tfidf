botanic fruit culinary fruit




venn diagram representing relationship culinary vegetables botanical fruitscitation needed


many common terms seeds fruit correspond botanical classifications culinary terminology fruit usually sweettasting plant part especially botanical fruit hard oily shelled plant product vegetable savory less sweet plant product5 however botany fruit ripened ovary carpel contains seeds type fruit seed seed ripened ovule6
examples culinary vegetables nuts botanically fruit include corn cucurbits cucumber pumpkin squash eggplant legumes beans peanuts peas sweet pepper tomato addition spices allspice chili pepper fruits botanically speaking6 contrast rhubarb often referred fruit used make sweet desserts pies though petiole leaf stalk rhubarb plant edible7 edible gymnosperm seeds often given fruit names ginkgo nuts pine nuts
botanically cereal grain corn rice wheat also kind fruit termed caryopsis however fruit wall thin fused seed coat almost edible grain actually seed8
structure
main article fruit anatomy
outer often edible layer pericarp formed ovary surrounding seeds although species tissues contribute form edible portion pericarp described three layers outer inner epicarp mesocarp endocarp
fruit bears prominent pointed terminal projection said beaked9
development




development sequence typical drupe nectarine prunus persica month period formation early winter fruit ripening midsummer image page information


fruit results maturation flowers gynoecium flowers forms part fruit10
inside ovaryovaries ovules megagametophyte contains cell11 double fertilization ovules become seeds ovules fertilized process starts pollination involves movement pollen stamens stigma flowers pollination tube grows pollen stigma ovary ovule sperm transferred pollen megagametophyte within megagametophyte sperm unites forming zygote second sperm enters central cell forming endosperm mother cell completes double fertilization process1213 later zygote give rise embryo seed endosperm mother cell give rise endosperm nutritive tissue used embryo
ovules develop seeds ovary begins ripen ovary wall pericarp become fleshy berries drupes form hard outer covering nuts multiseeded fruits extent flesh develops proportional number fertilized ovules14 pericarp often differentiated three distinct layers called exocarp outer layer also called epicarp mesocarp middle layer endocarp inner layer fruits especially simple fruits derived inferior ovary parts flower floral tube including petals sepals stamens fuse ovary ripen cases sepals petals andor stamens style flower fall floral parts significant part fruit called accessory fruit since parts flower contribute structure fruit important study flower structure understand particular fruit forms3
three general modes fruit development

apocarpous fruits develop single flower separate carpels simplest fruits
syncarpous fruits develop single gynoecium carpels fused together
multiple fruits form many different flowers

plant scientists grouped fruits three main groups simple fruits aggregate fruits composite multiple fruits15 groupings evolutionarily relevant since many diverse plant taxa group reflect flower organs arranged fruits develop
simple fruit




epigynous berries simple fleshy fruit clockwise right cranberries lingonberries blueberries huckleberries


simple fruits either fleshy result ripening simple compound ovary flower pistil fruits either dehiscent open discharge seeds indehiscent open discharge seeds16 types simple fruits examples include

achene commonly seen aggregate fruits strawberry
capsule brazil
caryopsis wheat
cypsela achenelike fruit derived individual florets capitulum dandelion
fibrous drupe coconut walnut
follicle formed single carpel opens suture milkweed commonly seen aggregate fruits magnolia
legume bean peanut
loment type indehiscent legume
beech hazelnut acorn
samara maple
schizocarp carrot seed
silique radish seed
silicle shepherds purse
utricle beet





lilium unripe capsule fruit


fruits part pericarp fruit wall fleshy maturity simple fleshy fruits types simple fleshy fruits examples include

berry cranberry gooseberry redcurrant tomato
stone fruit drupe apricot cherry olive peach plum





dewberry flowers note multiple pistils produce drupelet flower become blackberrylike aggregate fruit


aggregate fruit etaerio develops single flower numerous simple pistils17

magnolia peony collection follicles developing flower
sweet collection capsules
sycamore collection achenes
teasel collection cypsellas
tuliptree collection samaras

pome fruits family rosaceae including apples pears rosehips saskatoon berry syncarpous fleshy fruit simple fruit developing halfinferior ovary18
schizocarp fruits form syncarpous ovary really dehisce rather split segments seeds include number different forms wide range families15 carrot seed example
aggregate fruit
main article aggregate fruit




detail raspberry flower


aggregate fruits form single flowers multiple carpels joined together pistil contains carpel pistil forms fruitlet collectively fruitlets called etaerio four types aggregate fruits include etaerios achenes follicles drupelets berries ranunculaceae species including clematis ranunculus etaerio achenes calotropis etaerio follicles rubus species like raspberry etaerio drupelets annona etaerio berries1920
raspberry whose pistils termed drupelets like small drupe attached receptacle bramble fruits blackberry receptacle elongated part ripe fruit making blackberry aggregateaccessory fruit21 strawberry also aggregateaccessory fruit seeds contained achenes22 examples fruit develops single flower numerous pistils
multiple fruits
main article multiple fruit
multiple fruit formed cluster flowers called inflorescence flower produces fruit mature single mass23 examples pineapple mulberry osageorange breadfruit




plants noni flowers produced regularly along stem possible together examples flowering fruit development fruit ripening


photograph right stages flowering fruit development noni indian mulberry morinda citrifolia observed single branch first inflorescence white flowers called head produced fertilization flower develops drupe drupes expand become connate merge multiple fleshy fruit called syncarp
berries
main article berry
berries another type fleshy fruit simple fruit created single ovary24 ovary compound several carpels types include examples follow table

pepo berries whose skin hardened cucurbits
hesperidium berries rind juicy interior like citrus fruit

seedless fruits




seedless fruits






arrangement fruits commonly thought vegetables including tomatoes various squash


seedlessness important feature fruits commerce commercial cultivars bananas pineapples examples seedless fruits cultivars citrus fruits especially grapefruit mandarin oranges navel oranges satsumas table grapes watermelons valued seedlessness species seedlessness result parthenocarpy fruits without fertilization parthenocarpic fruit require pollination seedless citrus fruits require stimulus pollination produce fruit
seedless bananas grapes triploids seedlessness results abortion embryonic plant produced fertilization phenomenon known stenospermocarpy requires normal pollination fertilization25
seed dissemination
variations fruit structures largely depend seeds mode dispersal dispersal achieved animals explosive dehiscence water wind26
fruits coats covered spikes hooked burrs either prevent eaten animals stick feathers hairs legs animals using dispersal agents examples include cocklebur unicorn plant2728
sweet flesh many fruits deliberately appealing animals seeds held within eaten unwittingly carried away deposited defecated distance parent likewise nutritious oily kernels nuts appealing rodents squirrels hoard soil avoid starving winter thus giving seeds remain uneaten chance germinate grow plant away parent6
fruits elongated flattened naturally become thin like wings helicopter blades maple tuliptree evolutionary mechanism increase dispersal distance away parent wind winddispersed fruit tiny parachutes dandelion milkweed salsify26
coconut fruits float thousands miles ocean spread seeds fruits disperse water nipa palm screw pine26
fruits fling seeds substantial distances sandbox tree explosive dehiscence mechanisms impatiens squirting cucumber29
uses




nectarines many fruits easily stewed


many hundreds fruits including fleshy fruits like apple kiwifruit mango peach pear watermelon commercially valuable human food eaten fresh jams marmalade preserves fruits also used manufactured foods cakes cookies cream muffins yogurt beverages fruit juices apple juice grape juice orange juice alcoholic beverages brandy fruit beer wine30 fruits also used gift giving form fruit baskets fruit bouquets
many vegetables culinary parlance botanical fruits including bell pepper cucumber eggplant green bean okra pumpkin squash tomato zucchini31 olive fruit pressed olive spices like allspice black pepper paprika vanilla derived berries32
nutritional value




point refers serving fresh fruit daily recommended allowance vitamin axis potassium offset every fruit size disk represents amount fiber upper right watermelon almost fiber levels vitamin potassium comes last place


fresh fruits generally high fiber vitamin water33
regular consumption fruit generally associated reduced risks several diseases functional declines associated aging3435
nonfood uses
fruits major part human diet various cultures developed many different uses fruits depend food example

bayberry fruits provide often used make candles36
many fruits used decorations dried flower arrangements annual honesty cotoneaster lotus milkweed unicorn plant wheat ornamental trees shrubs often cultivated colorful fruits including beautyberry cotoneaster holly pyracantha skimmia viburnum37
fruits opium poppy source opium contains drugs codeine morphine well biologically inactive chemical theabaine drug oxycodone synthesized38
osage orange fruits used repel cockroaches39
many fruits provide natural dyes cherry mulberry sumac walnut40
dried gourds used bird houses cups decorations dishes musical instruments water jugs
pumpkins carved jackolanterns halloween
spiny fruit burdock cocklebur inspired invention velcro41
coir fiber coconut shells used brushes doormats floor tiles insulation mattresses sacking growing medium container plants shell coconut fruit used make bird houses bowls cups musical instruments souvenir heads42
fruit often subject still life paintings

safety
food safety recommends proper fruit handling preparation reduce risk food contamination foodborne illness fresh fruits vegetables carefully selected store damaged bruised precut pieces refrigerated surrounded
fruits vegetables rinsed eating recommendation also applies produce rinds skins eaten done preparing eating avoid premature spoilage
fruits vegetables kept separate foods like meat poultry seafood well utensils come contact foods fruits vegetables going cooked thrown away touched meat poultry seafood eggs
peeled cooked fruits vegetables refrigerated within hours certain time harmful bacteria grow increase risk foodborne illness43
allergies
fruit allergies make percent food related allergies4445
storage
fruits benefit proper post harvest care many fruits plant hormone ethylene causes ripening therefore maintaining fruits efficient cold chain optimal post harvest storage extending ensuring shelf life46
