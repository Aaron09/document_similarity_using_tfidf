applicationsedit
utility usually applied economists constructs indifference curve plot combination commodities individual society would accept maintain given level satisfaction utility indifference curves used economists understand underpinnings demand curves half supply demand analysis used analyze workings goods markets
individual utility social utility construed value utility function social welfare function respectively coupled production commodity constraints assumptions functions used analyze pareto efficiency illustrated edgeworth boxes contract curves efficiency central concept welfare economics
finance utility applied generate individuals price asset called indifference price utility functions also related risk measures common example entropic risk measure
revealed preferenceedit
recognized utility could measured observed directly instead economists devised infer underlying relative utilities observed choice revealed preferences named paul samuelson revealed peoples willingness

utility taken correlative desire want already argued desires cannot measured directly indirectly outward phenomena give rise cases economics chiefly concerned measure found price person willing fulfillment satisfaction desire178

functionsedit
controversy question whether utility commodity measured time assumed consumer able exactly much utility commodity economists made assumption belonged cardinalist school economics today utility functions expressing utility function amounts various goods consumed treated either cardinal ordinal depending whether interpreted providing information simply rank ordering preferences bundles goods information strength preferences
cardinaledit
main article cardinal utility
cardinal utility used magnitude utility differences treated ethically behaviorally significant quantity example suppose orange juice utility utils utility utils water utility utils cardinal utility concluded orange juice better exactly amount better water cannot conclude however thirds good juice conclusion would depend magnitudes utility differences also zero utility example zero utility located orange juice would utils zero utils zero
neoclassical economics largely retreated using cardinal utility functions basis economic behavior notable exception context analyzing choice conditions risk
sometimes cardinal utility used aggregate utilities across persons create social welfare function
ordinaledit
main article ordinal utility
ordinal utilities used differences utils values taken utility function treated ethically behaviorally meaningless utility index encodes full behavioral ordering members choice tells nothing related strength preferences example would possible juice preferred water
ordinal utility functions unique increasing monotone monotonic transformations example function

cambridge economist joan robinson famously criticized utility circular concept utility quality commodities makes individuals want fact individuals want commodities shows utility1148 robinson also pointed theory assumes preferences fixed means utility testable assumption take changes peoples behavior relation change prices change underlying budget constraint never sure extent change behavior change price budget constraint much change preferences12 criticism similar philosopher hans albert argued ceteris paribus conditions marginalist theory demand rested rendered theory empty tautology completely closed experimental testing13 essence demand supply curve theoretical line quantity product would offered requested given price purely ontological could never demonstrated empirically
another criticism comes assertion neither cardinal ordinal utility empirically observable real world case cardinal utility impossible measure level satisfaction quantitatively someone consumes purchases apple case ordinal utility impossible determine choices made someone purchases example orange would involve preference vast choices apple orange juice vegetable vitamin tablets exercise purchasing etc1415
questions arguments ought enter utility function difficult answer seem necessary understanding utility whether people gain utility coherence wants beliefs sense duty understanding behavior utility organon16 likewise choosing alternatives process determining consider alternatives question choice within uncertainty17
