historyedit
prehistory arithmetic limited small number artifacts indicate conception addition subtraction bestknown ishango bone central africa dating somewhere 20000 18000 although interpretation disputed2
earliest written records indicate egyptians babylonians used elementary arithmetic operations early 2000 artifacts always reveal specific process used solving problems characteristics particular numeral system strongly influence complexity methods hieroglyphic system egyptian numerals like later roman numerals descended tally marks used counting cases origin resulted values used decimal base include positional notation complex calculations roman numerals required assistance counting board roman abacus obtain results
early number systems included positional notation decimal including sexagesimal base system babylonian numerals vigesimal base system defined maya numerals placevalue concept ability reuse digits different values contributed simpler efficient methods calculation
continuous historical development modern arithmetic starts hellenistic civilization ancient greece although originated much later babylonian egyptian examples prior works euclid around greek studies mathematics overlapped philosophical mystical beliefs example nicomachus summarized viewpoint earlier pythagorean approach numbers relationships introduction arithmetic
greek numerals used archimedes diophantus others positional notation different ancient greeks lacked symbol zero hellenistic period used three separate sets symbols units place tens place hundreds thousands place would reuse symbols units place addition algorithm identical multiplication algorithm slightly different long division algorithm square root algorithm taught schoolclarification needed known archimedes invented preferred heros method successive approximation computed digit doesnt change square roots perfect squares 7485696 terminate immediately 2736 numbers fractional part 546934 used negative powers instead negative powers fractional part 09343
ancient chinese advanced arithmetic studies dating shang dynasty continuing tang dynasty basic numbers advanced algebra ancient chinese used positional notation similar greeks since also lacked symbol zero symbols units place second tens place hundreds place reused symbols units place symbols based ancient counting rods complicated question determine exactly chinese started calculating positional representation definitely ancient chinese first meaningfully discover understand apply negative numbers explained nine chapters mathematical jiuzhang suanshu written
gradual development hindu–arabic numerals independently devised placevalue concept positional notation combined simpler methods computations decimal base digit representing allowed system consistently represent large small integers approach eventually replaced systems early century indian mathematician aryabhata incorporated existing version system work experimented different notations century brahmagupta established separate number determined results multiplication division addition subtraction zero numbers except result division contemporary syriac bishop severus sebokht said indians possess method calculation word praise enough rational system mathematics method calculation mean system using nine symbols5 arabs also learned method called hesab

arithmetic operationsedit
also algebraic operation
basic arithmetic operations addition subtraction multiplication division although subject also includes advanced operations manipulations percentages square roots exponentiation logarithmic functions arithmetic performed according order operations objects upon four arithmetic operations except division performed four operations obey usual laws called field7
addition edit
main article addition
addition basic operation arithmetic simplest form addition combines numbers addends terms single number numbers
adding numbers viewed repeated addition procedure known summation includes ways infinitely many numbers infinite series repeated addition number basic form counting
addition commutative associative order terms added matter identity element addition additive identity adding number yields number also inverse element addition additive inverse opposite number adding opposite number number yields additive identity example opposite
addition given geometrically following example

sticks lengths place sticks length stick thus formed

subtraction −edit
main article subtraction
also method complements
subtraction inverse addition subtraction finds difference numbers minuend minus subtrahend minuend larger subtrahend difference positive minuend smaller subtrahend difference negative equal difference
subtraction neither commutative associative reason often helpful look subtraction addition minuend opposite subtrahend written properties addition hold
several methods calculating results particularly advantageous machine calculation example digital computers employ method twos complement great importance counting method change made suppose amount given required amount greater rather performing subtraction counting amount change money counted starting continuing reaching although amount counted must equal result subtraction subtraction never really done value might still unknown changemaker
multiplication edit
main article multiplication
multiplication second basic operation arithmetic multiplication also combines numbers single number product original numbers called multiplier multiplicand sometimes simply called factors
multiplication viewed scaling operation numbers imagined lying line multiplication number greater stretching everything away uniformly number stretched similarly multiplying number less imagined squeezing towards goes multiplicand
multiplication commutative associative distributive addition subtraction multiplicative identity multiplying number yields number also multiplicative inverse reciprocal number except number without multiplicative inverse multiplying reciprocal number number yields multiplicative identity
product written expressions written simply digits also written simple juxtaposition computer programming languages software packages characters normally found keyboard often written asterisk
division edit
main article division mathematics
division essentially inverse multiplication division finds quotient numbers dividend divided divisor dividend divided undefined distinct positive numbers dividend larger divisor quotient greater otherwise less similar rule applies negative numbers quotient multiplied divisor always yields dividend
division neither commutative associative helpful look subtraction addition helpful look division multiplication dividend times reciprocal divisor written product obeys properties multiplication
decimal arithmeticedit
decimal representation refers exclusively common written numeral system employing arabic numerals digits radix decimal positional notation however numeral system based powers greek cyrillic roman chinese numerals conceptually described decimal notation decimal representation
modern methods four fundamental operations addition subtraction multiplication division first devised brahmagupta india known medieval europe modus indoram method indians positional notation also known placevalue notation refers representation encoding numbers using symbol different orders magnitude ones place tens place hundreds place radix point using symbols represent fractions tenths place hundredths place example 50736 denotes hundreds plus tens plus units plus tenths 10−1 plus hundredths 10−2
concept number comparable basic digits essential notation concept placeholder definition multiplication addition placeholder therefore positional notation first attested jain text india entitled lokavibhâga dated early 13th century concepts transmitted scholarship arabic world introduced europe fibonacci8 using hindu–arabic numeral system
algorism comprises rules performing arithmetic computations using type written numeral example addition produces arbitrary numbers result calculated repeated addition single digits number occupies position proceeding right left addition table rows columns displays possible values individual exceeds value result represented digits rightmost digit value current position result subsequent addition digits left increases value second leftmost digit always adjustment termed carry value
process multiplying arbitrary numbers similar process addition multiplication table rows columns lists results pair digits individual product pair digits exceeds carry adjustment increases result subsequent multiplication digits left value equal second leftmost digit value additional steps define final result
similar techniques exist subtraction division
creation correct process multiplication relies relationship values adjacent digits value single digit numeral depends position also position left represents value times larger position right mathematical terms exponent radix base increases left decreases right therefore value arbitrary digit multiplied value form integer list values corresponding possible positions single digit written 10−1 10−2
repeated multiplication value list produces another value list mathematical terminology characteristic defined closure previous list described closed multiplication basis correctly finding results multiplication using previous technique outcome example uses number theory
