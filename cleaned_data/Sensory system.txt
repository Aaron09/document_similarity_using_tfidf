stimulusedit
sensory systems code four aspects stimulus type modality intensity location duration arrival time sound pulse phase differences continuous sound used sound localization certain receptors sensitive certain types stimuli example different mechanoreceptors respond best different kinds touch stimuli like sharp blunt objects receptors send impulses certain patterns send information intensity stimulus example loud sound location receptor stimulated gives brain information location stimulus example stimulating mechanoreceptor finger send information brain finger duration stimulus long lasts conveyed firing patterns receptors impulses transmitted brain afferent neurons
