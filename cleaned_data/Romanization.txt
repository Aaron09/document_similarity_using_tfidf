many consistent standardized romanization systems classified characteristics particular system’s characteristics make bettersuited various sometimes contradictory applications including document retrieval linguistic analysis easy readability faithful representation pronunciation

source donor language system tailored romanize text particular language series languages language particular writing system languagespecific system typically preserves language features like pronunciation general better cataloguing international texts
target receiver language systems intended audience speaks reads particular language socalled international romanization systems cyrillic text based centraleuropean alphabets like czech croatian alphabet
simplicity since basic latin alphabet smaller number letters many writing systems digraphs diacritics special characters must used represent latin script affects ease creation digital storage transmission reproduction reading romanized text
reversibility whether original restored converted text reversible systems allow irreversible simplified version

transliterationedit
main article transliteration
romanization attempts transliterate original script guiding principle onetoone mapping characters source language target script less emphasis result sounds pronounced according readers language example nihonshiki romanization japanese allows informed reader reconstruct original japanese kana syllables accuracy requires additional knowledge correct pronunciation
transcriptionedit
main article transcription linguistics
phonemicedit
also phonemic orthography
romanizations intended enable casual reader unfamiliar original script pronounce source language reasonably accurately romanizations follow principle phonemic transcription attempt render significant sounds phonemes original faithfully possible target language popular hepburn romanization japanese example transcriptive romanization designed english speakers
phoneticedit
also phonetic transcription
phonetic conversion goes step attempts depict phones source language sacrificing legibility necessary using characters conventions found target script practice representation almost never tries represent every possible allophone—especially occur naturally coarticulation effects—and instead limits significant allophonic distinctions international phonetic alphabet common system phonetic transcription
tradeoffsedit
language pairs building usable romanization involves tradeoffs extremes pure transcriptions generally possible source language usually contains sounds distinctions found target language must shown romanized form comprehensible furthermore diachronic synchronic variance written language represents spoken language perfect accuracy vocal interpretation script vary great degree among languages modern times chain transcription usually spoken foreign language written foreign language written native language spoken read native language reducing number processes removing steps writing usually leads accurate oral articulations general outside limited audience scholars romanizations tend lean towards transcription example consider japanese martial nihonshiki romanization zyûzyutu allow someone knows japanese reconstruct kana syllables じゅうじゅつ native english speakers rather readers would find easier guess pronunciation hepburn version jūjutsu
