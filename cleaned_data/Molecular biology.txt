molecular biology məˈlɛkjʊlər concerns molecular basis biological activity biomolecules various systems cell including interactions proteins biosynthesis well regulation interactions1 writing nature 1961 william astbury described molecular biology

much technique approach approach viewpoint socalled basic sciences leading idea searching largescale manifestations classical biology corresponding molecular plan concerned particularly forms biological molecules predominantly threedimensional structural—which mean however merely refinement morphology must time inquire genesis function2
