pollinator1 encourages pollination


pollination process pollen transferred female reproductive organs plant thereby enabling fertilization take place like living organisms seed plants single major purpose pass genetic information next generation reproductive unit seed pollination essential step production seeds spermatophytes seed plants
process pollination successful pollen grain produced anther male part flower must transferred stigma female part flower plant species process rather different angiosperms flowering plants gymnosperms seed plants angiosperms pollen grain landed stigma creates pollen tube grows style reaches ovary sperm cells pollen grain move along pollen tube enter cell micropyle fertilise resulting production seed
successful angiosperm pollen grain gametophyte containing male gametes transported stigma germinates pollen tube grows style ovary gametes travel tube gametophytes containing female gametes held within carpel nucleus fuses polar bodies produce endosperm tissues ovule produce embryo23 hence term double fertilization
gymnosperms ovule contained carpel exposed surface dedicated support organ scale cone penetration carpel tissue unnecessary details process vary according division gymnosperms question main modes fertilization found gymnosperms cycads ginkgo motile sperm swim directly inside ovule whereas conifers gnetophytes sperm unable swim conveyed along pollen tube

pollination accomplished crosspollination selfpollination

crosspollination also called allogamy occurs pollen delivered stamen flower stigma flower another plant species5 plants adapted crosspollination several mechanisms prevent selfpollination reproductive organs arranged selffertilisation unlikely stamens carpels mature different times5
selfpollination occurs pollen flower pollinates flower flowers individual20 thought evolved conditions pollinators reliable vectors pollen transport often seen shortlived annual species plants colonize locations21 selfpollination include autogamy pollen transferred female part flower geitonogamy pollen transferred another flower plant22 plants adapted selffertilize often similar stamen carpel lengths plants pollinate produce viable offspring called selffertile plants cannot fertilize called selfsterile condition mandates crosspollination production offspring22
cleistogamy selfpollination occurs flower opens pollen released anther within flower pollen anther grows tube style ovules type sexual breeding contrast asexual systems apomixis cleistogamous flowers never open contrast chasmogamous flowers open pollinated cleistogamous flowers necessity found selfcompatible selffertile plants23 although certain orchids grasses entirely cleistogamous plants resort strategy adverse conditions often mixture cleistogamous chasmogamous flowers sometimes different parts plant sometimes mixed inflorescences ground bean produces cleistogamous flowers ground mixed cleistogamous chasmogamous flowers above24

estimated plant species either dioecious selfincompatible obligate outcrossers25 also estimated flowering plants exhibit mixed mating system nature26 common kind mixed mating system individual plants produce single type flower fruits contain selfpollinated outcrossed mixture progeny types
pollination also requires consideration pollenizers terms pollinator pollenizer often confused pollinator agent moves pollen whether bees flies bats moths birds pollenizer plant serves pollen source plants plants selfcompatible selffertile pollinate fertilize plants chemical physical barriers selfpollination
agriculture horticulture pollination management good pollenizer plant provides compatible viable plentiful pollen blooms time plant pollinated pollen stored used needed pollinate desired flowers hybridization effective pollination flowers different species different breeding lines populations also heterosis
