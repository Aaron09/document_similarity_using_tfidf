main feature outsourcing influencing policymaking unpredictability generates regarding future particular sector skillgroup uncertainty future conditions influences governance approaches different aspects longterm policies
competitiveness strategyedit
economic growth requires change therefore governance disposed helping social economic structures adapt changing environment facilitate growth stable transition economic structures34 economic structures become detrimental social political cultural structures
developing countries policies embrace global phenomenon outsourcing logical response ongoing movement towards open markets trade liberalization outsourcing interpreted trade phenomenon complements trade liberalization strategies promoting technological spillovers capital inflows also offsetting increasing levels unemployment result opening domestic markets prices adjust global market longer reflect domestic productivity driving lowerproductivity firms previously protected sectors business economic theorists argue resulting unemployment temporary workers readjust eventually incorporated countrys productive sectors namely enjoy competitive edge players international market nonetheless rapid liberalization markets developing countries maximized productivity potential region global south technological development drastically lower north redeployment human capital resources export markets come cost necessarily lowproductivity sectors rather underdeveloped ones words many previously protected sectors competitive global scale naturally lacked comparative advantage industry efficiency reached35 cases liberalization stunts growth potential industries unemployment reflection many underemployed resources
outsourcing fills receding protected national industries improving employment living standards among economic externalities outsourcing promotes capital inflows infrastructure mexico wage convergence faster cities outsourcing first took hold maquiladoras along mexico–united states border studies suggest every increase wages northern cities mexico influenced outsourcing would experience wage rises higher inner cities36
corruption reduced revenues signing nafta limited economic resources available mexican government thus explaining difference investment policies mexico china35 conversely successes asian countries twentieth century promotion higher rates saving investment studies suggest increase capital input fueled ‘asian miracle’ rather improvements productivity industrial efficiency though previous conclusion suggests production conditions region remained static situation east asia experienced rapid transformations national educational rates raised drastically also increase patenting research development expenditures rising levels education urbanization even patenting illustrate active role government advancing education well encouraging research development37
education strategyedit
jobs become outsourced based skilllevel group represents rather based variety factors including transportation cost ideas wage labour productivity edge34 overall uncertainty regarding future dynamics outsourcing possible predict nature labour demand different regions better prepare domestic workforce future industry demands therefore national education programs ought focus flexibility diversity skills rather specific taskoriented skills emphasis preparing students succeed nonhabitual tasks adapt changes labour demands market38 specific goal ought adopted teaching students learn rather teach particular skills strategy would help students adapt changing skill requirements future thus reducing friction structural unemployment34
welfare state strategyedit

negative welfare effects outsourcing gathered substantial public attention possibility outsourcing internationalized labour markets used local opening jobs traditionally nontraded international competition resulting combination lower wages unemployment certain jobs driven perceived ‘losers’ engage heated political debate
labour unions european union succeeded pushing protectionist policies favour lowerskilled groups throughout 1970s 1980s including common agricultural policy farming34 interest groups opposing outsourcing active voice disapproval negative outcomes phenomenon concentrated specific groups people namely losing jobs external competition whereas benefits become dissipated among population large overall lower prices greater quality variety goods domestic markets benefits exploiting countrys comparative advantage outsourcing
unlike alleged ‘losers’ outsourcing affected positively lack motivation organize voice support wave protectionismwhen concerned deep changes social structure allegedly imposed global system globalization outsourcing activistswho readjustment class systems highlight increased fracture societies ‘haves’ ‘havenots’ different groups adjust increasingly decreasingly advantageous positions system outsourcing opponents outsourcing also denounced threat local cultural integrity
argument cultural disintegration points standardization practices norms multinational corporations become involved industries regions culturally different country origin alleged diffusion culture raised concern endurance cultural norms values sociopolitical institutions frameworks even cultural preferences traditions context increasing foreign presence40
increased uncertainty regarding future socioeconomic security ought policies promoting equality fair redistribution economic gains government maintain voters’ favour overall unpredictability governments likely need reassure civilians burden employment jobs resulting outsourcing shared among taxpayers34

union busting possible cause outsourcing unions disadvantaged union busting legislation workers lose bargaining power becomes easier corporations fire ship overseas53
another rationale high corporate income rate relative oecd nations5455 practice taxing revenues earned outside jurisdiction uncommon practice however outsourcing solely phenomenon corporations various nations rates outsource well means high taxation partially explain outsourcing example amount corporate outsourcing 1950 would considerably lower today rate actually higher 195056
also suggested lowering corporate income ending doubletaxation foreignderived revenue taxed nation revenue raised alleviate corporate outsourcing make attractive foreign companies however high official rate actual taxes paid corporations considerably lower loopholes havens gaming system57 rather avoiding taxes outsourcing mostly driven desire lower labor costs standpoint labor sarbanesoxley also cited factor corporate flight jurisdiction

counterwave outsourcingedit
firms reversed decision outsource results entirely expected circumstances allow firms unbundle different tasks stages manufacturing process different locations fully determined though nature tasks plays role determining interconnectedness factors innovation manufacturing process advances transport communication technology also affect need direct contact among employees process ties tasks together within firms remains unclear degree uncertainty tasks need remain geographically clustered together many cases firms took risks experimenting outsourcing lacking firm understanding relationship among internal tasks spatial implications43
despite saving money companies often faced unexpected drawbacks outsourcing miscommunication lower quality intermediate products delaying overall production process another reason decrease outsourcing many jobs subcontracted abroad replaced technological advances61
according deloitte consulting survey carried 2005 quarter companies outsourced tasks reversed strategy many companies like lenovo considered turning around outsourcing strategies outsourcing61
