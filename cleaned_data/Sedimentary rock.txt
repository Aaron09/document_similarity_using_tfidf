sandstones




sedimentary rock sandstone malta


sandstone classification schemes vary widely geologists adopted dott scheme3 uses relative abundance quartz feldspar lithic framework grains abundance muddy matrix larger grains

composition framework grains
relative abundance sandsized framework grains determines first word sandstone name naming depends dominance three abundant components quartz feldspar lithic fragments originated rocks minerals considered accessories used naming rock regardless abundance

transformation diagenesis




pressure solution work clastic rock material dissolves places grains contact material recrystallize solution cement open pore spaces result flow material areas high stress stress producing sedimentary rock becomes compact harder loose sand become sandstone


main article diagenesis
term diagenesis used describe chemical physical biological changes exclusive surface weathering undergone sediment initial deposition processes cause sediment consolidate compact solid substance originally loose material young sedimentary rocks especially quaternary recent period geologic time scale often still unconsolidated sediment deposition builds overburden lithostatic pressure rises process known lithification takes place
sedimentary rocks often saturated seawater groundwater minerals dissolve minerals precipitate precipitating minerals reduce pore space rock process called cementation decrease pore space original connate fluids expelled precipitated minerals form cement make rock compact competent loose clasts sedimentary rock become glued together
sedimentation continues older rock layer becomes buried deeper result lithostatic pressure rock increases weight overlying sediment causes compaction process grains mechanically reorganize compaction example important diagenetic process clay initially consist water compaction interstitial water pressed pore spaces compaction also result dissolution grains pressure solution dissolved material precipitates open pore spaces means flow material pores however cases certain mineral dissolves precipitate process called leaching increases pore space rock
biochemical processes like activity bacteria affect minerals rock therefore seen part diagenesis fungi plants roots various organisms live beneath surface also influence diagenesis
burial rocks ongoing sedimentation leads increased pressure temperature stimulates certain chemical reactions example reactions organic material becomes lignite coal temperature pressure increase still realm diagenesis makes metamorphism process forms metamorphic rock
