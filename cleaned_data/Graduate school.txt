graduate degrees brazil called postgraduate degrees taken undergraduate education concluded

lato sensu graduate degrees degrees represent specialization certain area take years complete sometimes used describe specialization level masters degree sense main difference lato sensu courses tend deeper scientific aspects study field programs tend focused practical professional aspects used frequently business management administration areas however since norms regulate names used indiscriminately time
stricto sensu graduate degrees degrees wish pursue academic career

masters years completion usually serves additional qualification seeking differential market maybe later want pursue doctoral programs brazil require masters degree stricto sensu meaning lato sensu degree usually insufficient start doctoral program
doctors years completion usually used stepping stone academic life

admissionedit
admission masters program generally requires bachelors degree related field sufficiently high grades usually ranging higher note different schools different letter grade conventions requirement significantly higher faculties recommendations professors schools require samples students writing well research proposal englishspeaking universities applicants countries english primary language required submit scores test english foreign language toefl
admission doctoral program typically requires masters degree related field sufficiently high grades recommendations samples writing research proposal interview prospective supervisor requirements often higher masters program exceptional cases student holding honours sufficiently high grades proven writing research abilities admitted directly program without requirement first complete masters many canadian graduate programs allow students start masters reclassify program satisfactory performance first year bypassing masters degree
students must usually declare research goal submit research proposal upon entering graduate school case masters degrees flexibility held ones research proposal although major changes example premodern modern history discouraged case phds research direction usually known typically follow direction masters research
masters degrees completed year normally take least typically exceed five years doctoral degrees require minimum years frequently take much longer although usually exceeding years
fundingedit
graduate students take student loans instead often work teaching research assistants students often agree condition acceptance programme devote twelve hours week work outside interests various universities canada different policies terms much funding available funding also different within university disciplines many universities offer evening programs students able work fulltime obtaining evening classes allows school4
masters students funding generally available firstyear students whose transcripts reflect exceptionally high grades funding also obtained second year studies funding students comes variety sources many universities waive tuition fees doctoral candidates also occur masters students universities funding available form scholarships bursaries awards private public
requirements completionedit
masters doctoral programs done coursework research combination depending subject faculty faculties require emphasis research coursework directly related field research
masters candidates undertaking research typically required complete thesis comprising original research ranging seventy twohundred pages fields require candidates study least foreign language already earned sufficient foreignlanguage credits faculties require candidates defend thesis many often requirement taking additional courses minimum lieu preparing thesis
candidates undertaking research must typically complete thesis dissertation consisting original research representing significant contribution field ranging twohundred fivehundred pages candidates required comprehensive examinations—examinations testing general knowledge field specialization—in second third year prerequisite continuing studies must defend thesis final requirement faculties require candidates earn sufficient credits third fourth foreign language example candidates modern japanese topics must demonstrate ability english japanese mandarin candidates premodern japanese topics must demonstrate ability english japanese classical chinese classical japanese language
englishspeaking canadian universities masters theses presented english language subject german german literature example case extensive abstract must also presented english exceptional circumstances thesis presented french
frenchspeaking universities varying sets rules accept students little knowledge french communicate supervisors usually english

united statesedit
admissionedit
graduate programs similar list general admission requirements importance placed type requirement vary drastically graduate schools departments within schools even programs within departments best determine graduate program weigh admission materials person charge graduate admissions particular program applied admission graduate school requires bachelors degree high grades ones field study important—grades outside field less graduate record examination standardized test required almost graduate schools additional standardised tests graduate management admission test gmat graduate record examination subject tests scores required institutions programs67 addition good letters recommendation undergraduate instructors often essential8 strong recommendation letters mentors supervisors undergraduate research experience provide evidence applicant perform research handle rigors graduate school education
within sciences social sciences previous research experience important69 contrast within humanities disciplines example academic writing normally suffices many universities require personal statement sometimes called statement purpose letter intent include indications intended areas research7 detailed statement whether possible change ones focus research depends strongly discipline department student applying
disciplines universities graduate applicants find best least recommendation research work outside college earned bachelors degreecitation needed however previous research experience important humanities disciplines
schools minimum gpas test scores accept applicants10 reduces time spent reviewing applications hand many institutions often explicitly state sort cutoffs terms scores instead claim consider many factors including past research achievements compatibility applicants research interest faculty statement purpose letters reference stated programs also require professors sponsors finally applicants nonenglish speaking countries often must take test english foreign language toefl11
institutions decisions regarding admission made institution department student applying departments require interviews making decision accept applicant7 universities adhere council graduate schools resolution regarding graduate scholars fellows trainees assistants gives applicants april accept reject offers contain financial support12
nondegree seekingedit
addition traditional degreeseeking applications admission many schools allow students apply degreeseeking13 admission degree category usually restricted primarily benefit professionally additional study graduate level example current primary middle grades secondary education teachers wishing gain recertification credit commonly apply degreeseeking students
requirements completionedit
graduate students often declare intended degree masters doctorate applications cases masters programs allow successful students continue toward doctorate degree additionally doctoral students advanced candidacy filed dissertation dissertation often receive masters degrees additional masters called master philosophy mphil candidate philosophy cphil degree masters component doctorate program often requires years
many graduate programs require students pass several examinations order demonstrate competence scholars6 departments comprehensive examination often required first year doctoral study designed test students background undergraduatelevel knowledge examinations type common sciences social sciences relatively unknown humanities disciplines
graduate students perform teaching duties often serving graders tutors departments promoted lecturer status position comes responsibility
doctoral students generally spend roughly first three years taking coursework begin research second year many masters specialist students perform research culminating paper presentation defense research called masters thesis educational specialist students specialist paper however many masters degree programs require masters thesis focusing instead primarily course work practicals workshops students complete final culminating project capstone rather thesis realworld experience typically require candidate work project alone team consultant consultants outside entity approved selected academic institution faculty supervision
second third years study doctoral programs often require students pass examinations6 programs often require qualifying examination quals candidacy examination candidacy general examination generals designed ensure students grasp broad sample discipline andor several special field examinations specials test students narrower selected areas specialty within discipline examinations held orally known colloquially orals social science many humanities disciplines graduate students studied discipline undergraduate level exams first based either graduate coursework specific preparatory reading sometimes years work reading
cases comprehensive exams normally stressful time consuming must passed allowed proceed dissertation passing examinations allows student stay begin doctoral research rise status doctoral candidate failing usually results student leaving program retaking test time passed usually semester year schools intermediate category passing masters level allows student leave masters without completed masters dissertation
next several years doctoral candidate primarily performs research usually lasts three eight years though finish quickly take substantially longer total typical doctoral degree takes four eight years entering program completion though time varies depending upon department dissertation topic many factors example astronomy degrees take five years average observational astronomy degrees take seven limiting factors weather theoretical astronomy degrees take five
though substantial variation among universities departments individuals humanities social science doctorates average take somewhat longer complete natural science doctorates differences differing nature research humanities social sciences natural sciences differing expectations discipline coursework languages length dissertation however time required complete doctorate also varies according candidates abilities choice research students also choose remain program fail academic position particularly disciplines tight market remaining student retain access libraries university facilities also retaining academic affiliation essential conferences jobsearches
traditionally doctoral programs intended last three four years disciplines primarily natural sciences helpful advisor light teaching load possible degree completed amount time however increasingly many disciplines including humanities requirements coursework languages expected extent dissertation research assumption students take five years minimum seven years average competition jobs within fields also raises expectations length quality dissertations considerably
competition jobs within certain fields life sciences great almost students enter second training period graduate school called postdoctoral fellowship total life scientists invest 12–14 years lowpaid training positions obtain tenure track jobs miller mccune real science average life scientists obtain first grant conduct independent research
disciplines doctoral programs average seven years archaeology requires long periods research tends towards longer spectrum increase length degree matter great concern students universities though much disagreement potential solutions problem
fundingedit
general less funding available students admitted masters degrees students admitted doctoral degrees many departments especially students research teaching responsibilities offer students tuition waivers stipend pays expenses elite universities minimum stipend established students well tuition waiver terms stipends vary greatly consist scholarship fellowship followed teaching responsibilities many elite universities stipends increasing response student pressure especially competition among elite universities graduate students
fields research positions coveted teaching positions student researchers typically paid work dissertation required complete anyway teaching generally considered distraction ones work research positions typical science disciplines relatively uncommon humanities disciplines exist rarely allow student work research science students apply individual nrsa fellowships fellowships private foundations universities often also offer competitive support nihfunded training programs example biotechnology training program university virginia departments often funds limited discretionary funding supplement minor expenses research trips travel conferences
students attain funding dissertation improvement grants funded national science foundation similar programs agencies many students also funded researchers faculty funded private foundations national institutes health federal mission agencies department defense environmental protection agency natural sciences typically well funded students attain either outside institutional funding humanities humanities students borrow money coursework take fulltime jobs completing dissertations students social sciences less well funded students natural physical sciences often funding opportunities students humanities particularly science funders begin value social science research
funding differs greatly departments universities universities give five years full funding students though often teaching requirement attached universities however teaching requirements research years even best funded universities often funding humanities social science students need research elsewhere whether united states overseascitation needed students find funding outside funders private foundations german marshall fund social science research council ssrc
foreign students typically funded domestic students although federally subsidized student parent loans workstudy assistance generally limited citizens nationals permanent residents approved refugees14 moreover funding sources many fellowships awarded domestic students international students often unique financial difficulties high costs visit families back home support family allowed work immigration laws tuition expensive world standards large fees visa fees citizenship immigration services surveillance fees student exchange visitor program united states department homeland security15
graduate employee unionsedit
many universities graduate students employed university teach classes research graduate employees graduate students many graduate students employees students example usually tuition paid teaching research positions many countries graduate employees collectively organized labor unions order bargain contract university canada example almost graduate employees members cupe local
united states many graduate employee unions public universities coalition graduate employee unions lists recognized unions public universities website private universities however covered national labor relations rather state labor laws 2001 recognized unions private universities
many graduate students akin junior faculty significantly lower paycitation needed many graduate students feel teaching takes time would better spent research many point vicious circle academic labor economy institutions rely cheap graduate student labor need create expensive professorships graduate students taught extensively graduate school find immensely difficult teaching obtained degree many institutions depend heavily graduate student teaching 2003 report agitators graduate student union yale16 instance claims undergraduate teaching contact hours yale performed transient teachers graduate teachers adjunct instructors teachers tenure track state michigan leads terms progressive policy regarding graduate student unions five universities recognizing graduate employee unions central michigan university michigan state university university michigan wayne state university western michigan university
united auto workers slogan uniting academic workers american federation teachers international unions represent graduate employees private universities administrations often oppose graduate students form unions arguing students exempt labor laws intended employees cases unionization movements enough student opposition fail schools graduate employees unionized positions unionized vary sometimes employees unionize teaching assistants residential directors times typically fellowship recipients usually employed university participate
negotiations fail graduate employee unions sometimes strike graduate student unions types strikes unions also made teachins workins marches rallies grade strikes grade strike graduate students refuse grade exams papers strike lasts academic term also refuse turn final grades another form action known worktorule graduate student instructors work exactly many hours paid
