hellenic worldedit
early greeks speculation theorizing ranged flat disc advocated homer spherical body postulated pythagoras pythagorass idea supported later aristotle2 pythagoras mathematician perfect figure sphere reasoned gods would create perfect figure therefore earth created spherical shape anaximenes early greek philosopher believed strongly earth rectangular shape
since spherical shape widely supported greek efforts determine size followed plato determined circumference earth slightly 40000 400000 stadia 62800 74000 46250 39250 archimedes estimated 300000 stadia 48300 30000 using hellenic stadion scholars generally take meters ​1⁄10 geographical mile platos figure guess archimedes conservative approximation
hellenistic worldedit
egypt greek scholar philosopher eratosthenes devised method explicit measurement earths size reports ancient city swenett later known syene stated summer solstice midday shone bottom well observed alexandria directly overhead instead cast shadow vertical equal 150th circle observations hellenistic astronomy knowledge local geography already established summer solstice midday directly tropic cancer syene tropic alexandria syene direct northsouth line relatively long away would later known astronomical unit determined distance alexandria syene 5000 stadia possibly hired someone walk measure distance likely using reports travelers distance usual hellenic stadion




eratosthenes method determining size earth


observations measurements andor known facts eratosthenes concluded since angular deviation vertical direction alexandria also angle subtended illustration linear distance alexandria syene circumference earth thus must 50×5000 250000 stadia probably 25000 geographical miles circumference earth 24902 4007516 poles precisely 40008 24860 actual unit measure used eratosthenes stadion knows sure stadion equals modern units possibly hellenic stadion
experiment carried described would remarkable agreed actuality remarkable result probably high measurements subject several inaccuracies though summer solstice noon overhead tropic cancer syene exactly tropic latitude geographical miles north difference latitude alexandria degrees north latitude syene degrees really degrees rather perhaps rounded circle value eratosthenes used actual solstice zenith distance noon alexandria circle error closely consistent vertical gnomon fixes suns center solar upper limb higher importantly flawed element whether measured adopted latitudinal distance alexandria syene true tropic somewhat south appears caused overestimate relates error resulting circumference earth
parallel later ancient measurement size earth made another greek scholar posidonius noted star canopus hidden view parts greece grazed horizon rhodes posidonius supposed measured angular elevation canopus alexandria determined angle circle used distance alexandria rhodes 5000 stadia computed earths circumference stadia times 5000 2400003 scholars results luckily semiaccurate cancellation errors since canopus observations mistaken degree experiment much recycling eratostheness numbers altering correct circle later either follower appears altered base distance agree eratostheness alexandriatorhodes figure 3750 stadia since posidoniuss final circumference 180000 stadia equals 48×3750 stadia4 180000 stadia circumference posidonius suspiciously close results another method measuring earth timing ocean sunsets different heights method inaccurate horizontal atmospheric refraction
abovementioned larger smaller sizes earth used claudius ptolemy different times 252000 stadia almagest 180000 stadia later geography midcareer conversion resulted latter works systematic exaggeration degree longitudes mediterranean factor close ratio seriously differing sizes discussed indicates conventional size earth changed stadion
