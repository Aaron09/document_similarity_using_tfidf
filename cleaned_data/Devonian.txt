first significant adaptive radiation life land occurred devonian freesporing vascular plants began spread across land forming extensive forests covered continents middle devonian several groups plants evolved leaves true roots period first seedbearing plants appeared various terrestrial arthropods also became wellestablished
fish reached substantial diversity time leading devonian often dubbed fish first rayfinned lobefinned bony fish appeared placoderms began dominating almost every known aquatic environment ancestors fourlimbed vertebrates tetrapods began adapting walking land strong pectoral pelvic fins gradually evolved legs10 oceans primitive sharks became numerous silurian late ordovician
