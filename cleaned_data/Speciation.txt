historical backgroundedit
addressing question origin species issues evolutionary mechanisms speciation accounts separateness individuality species biota since charles darwins time efforts understand nature species primarily focused first aspect widely agreed critical factor behind origin species reproductive isolation5 next focus second aspect origin species
darwins dilemma species existedit
origin species 1859 darwin interpreted biological evolution terms natural selection perplexed clustering organisms species6 chapter darwins book entitled difficulties theory discussing difficulties noted firstly species descended species insensibly fine gradations everywhere innumerable transitional forms nature confusion instead species well defined dilemma referred absence rarity transitional varieties habitat space7
another dilemma8 related first absence rarity transitional varieties time darwin pointed theory natural selection innumerable transitional forms must existed wondered find embedded countless numbers crust earth clearly defined species actually exist nature space time implies fundamental feature natural selection operates generate maintain species6
effect sexual reproduction species formationedit
argued resolution darwins first dilemma lies fact outcrossing sexual reproduction intrinsic cost rarity910111213 cost rarity arises follows resource gradient large number separate species evolve exquisitely adapted narrow band gradient species necessity consist members finding mate circumstances present difficulties many individuals neighborhood belong species circumstances species’ population size happens chance increase expense neighboring species environment saturated immediately make easier members find sexual partners members neighboring species whose population sizes decreased experience greater difficulty finding mates therefore form pairs less frequently larger species snowball effect large species growing expense smaller rarer species eventually driving extinction eventually species remain distinctly different other91012 cost rarity involves costs failure find mate also indirect costs cost communication seeking partner population densities




african pygmy kingfisher showing coloration shared adults species high degree fidelity14


rarity brings costs rare unusual features seldom advantageous instances indicate nonsilent mutation almost certain deleterious therefore behooves sexual creatures avoid mates sporting rare unusual features1516 sexual populations therefore rapidly shed rare peripheral phenotypic features thus canalizing entire external appearance illustrated accompanying illustration african pygmy kingfisher ispidina picta remarkable uniformity adult members sexual species stimulated proliferation field guides birds mammals reptiles insects many taxa species described single illustration case sexual dimorphism population become homogeneous appearance typical species illustrated photograph african pygmy kingfisher members avoid mating members populations look different themselves17 thus avoidance mates displaying rare unusual phenotypic features inevitably leads reproductive isolation hallmarks speciation18192021
contrasting case organisms reproduce asexually cost rarity consequently benefits finescale adaptation thus asexual organisms frequently show continuous variation form often many different directions darwin expected evolution produce making classification species correctly morphospecies difficult91516222324

allopatricedit
main article allopatric speciation
allopatric ancient greek allos greek patrā fatherland speciation population splits geographically isolated populations example habitat fragmentation geographical change mountain formation isolated populations undergo genotypic phenotypic divergence become subjected dissimilar selective pressures independently undergo genetic drift different mutations arise populations populations come back contact evolved reproductively isolated longer capable exchanging genes island genetics term associated tendency small isolated genetic pools produce unusual traits examples include insular dwarfism radical changes among certain famous island chains example komodo galápagos islands particularly famous influence charles darwin five weeks heard galápagos tortoises could identified island noticed finches differed island another nine months later reflected facts could show species changeable returned england speculation evolution deepened experts informed separate species varieties famously differing galápagos birds species finches though finches less important darwin recent research shown birds known darwins finches classic case adaptive evolutionary radiation27
peripatricedit
main article peripatric speciation
peripatric speciation subform allopatric speciation species formed isolated smaller peripheral populations prevented exchanging genes main population related concept founder effect since small populations often undergo bottlenecks genetic drift often proposed play significant role peripatric speciation

parapatricedit
main article parapatric speciation
parapatric speciation partial separation zones diverging populations afforded geography individuals species come contact cross habitats time time reduced fitness heterozygote leads selection behaviours mechanisms prevent interbreeding parapatric speciation modelled continuous variation within single connected habitat acting source natural selection rather effects isolation habitats produced peripatric allopatric speciation

sympatricedit




freshwater angelfish cichlid


main article sympatric speciation
sympatric speciation formation descendant species single ancestral species occupying geographic location
oftencited examples sympatric speciation found insects become dependent different host plants area3334 however existence sympatric speciation mechanism speciation remains highly debated35
best illustrated example sympatric speciation cichlids east africa inhabiting rift valley lakes particularly lake victoria lake malawi lake tanganyika described species according estimates could well 1600 species region evolution cited example natural sexual selection3637 2008 study suggests sympatric speciation occurred tennessee cave salamanders38 sympatric speciation driven ecological factors also account extraordinary diversity crustaceans living depths siberias lake baikal39
budding speciation proposed particular form sympatric speciation whereby small groups individuals become progressively isolated ancestral stock breeding preferentially another type speciation would driven conjunction various advantages inbreeding expression advantageous recessive phenotypes reducing recombination load reducing cost

hawthorn rhagoletis pomonella also known apple maggot appears undergoing sympatric speciation41 different populations hawthorn feed different fruits distinct population emerged north america 19th century time apples nonnative species introduced applefeeding population normally feeds apples historically preferred fruit hawthorns current hawthorn feeding population normally feed apples evidence thirteen allozyme loci different hawthorn flies mature later season take longer mature apple flies little evidence interbreeding researchers documented hybridization rate suggests sympatric speciation occurring42
methods selectionedit
reinforcementedit
main article reinforcement speciation
reinforcement sometimes referred wallace effect process natural selection increases reproductive isolation18 occur populations species separated come back contact reproductive isolation complete already developed separate incompatible species reproductive isolation incomplete mating populations produce hybrids fertile hybrids infertile fertile less ancestors reproductive isolation speciation essentially occurred horses donkeys43
reasoning behind parents hybrid offspring naturally selected traits certain environments hybrid offspring bear traits therefore would either ecological niche well either parent fitness hybrids would cause selection favor assortative mating would control hybridization sometimes called wallace effect evolutionary biologist alfred russel wallace suggested late 19th century might important factor speciation44
conversely hybrid offspring ancestors populations merge back species within area contact
reinforcement favoring reproductive isolation required parapatric sympatric speciation without reinforcement geographic area contact different forms species called hybrid zone develop boundary different species hybrid zones regions diverged populations meet interbreed hybrid offspring common regions usually created diverged species coming secondary contact without reinforcement species would uncontrollable inbreeding reinforcement induced artificial selection experiments described
ecologicaledit
main article ecological speciation
ecological selection interaction individuals environment resource acquisition45 natural selection inherently involved process speciation whereby ecological speciation populations different environments populations exploiting different resources experience contrasting natural selection pressures traits directly indirectly bring evolution reproductive isolation46 evidence role ecology plays process speciation exists studies stickleback populations support ecologicallylinked speciation arising byproduct47 alongside numerous studies parallel speciation isolation evolves independent populations species adapting contrasting environments independent populations adapting similar environments48 ecological speciation occurs much evidence accumulated topdown studies adaptation reproductive isolation48
sexual selectionedit
widely appreciated sexual selection could drive speciation many clades independently natural selection49 however term “speciation” context tends used different mutually exclusive senses first commonly used sense refers “birth” species splitting existing species separate species budding species parent species driven biological fashion preference feature features sexes necessarily adaptive qualities49505152 second sense speciation refers widespread tendency sexual creatures grouped clearly defined species5319 rather forming continuum phenotypes time space would obvious logical consequence natural selection indeed recognized darwin problematic included origin species 1859 heading difficulties theory6 several suggestions mate choice might play significant role resolving darwin’s dilemma19915161754

speciation polyploidizationedit
main article polyploid
polyploidy mechanism caused many rapid speciation events sympatry offspring example tetraploid diploid matings often result triploid sterile progeny66 however polyploids reproductively isolated parental plants gene flow still occur example triploid hybrid diploid matings produce tetraploids matings meiotically unreduced gametes diploids gametes tetraploids also hybrid speciation
suggested many existing plant animal species undergone event polyploidization evolutionary history6768 reproduction successful polyploid species sometimes asexual parthenogenesis apomixis unknown reasons many asexual organisms polyploid rare instances polyploid mammals known often result prenatal death
hybrid speciationedit
main article hybrid speciation
hybridization different species sometimes leads distinct phenotype phenotype also fitter parental lineage natural selection favor individuals eventually reproductive isolation achieved lead separate species however reproductive isolation hybrids parents particularly difficult achieve thus hybrid speciation considered extremely rare event mariana mallard thought arisen hybrid speciation
hybridization important means speciation plants since polyploidy copies chromosome tolerated plants readily animals6970 polyploidy important hybrids allows reproduction different sets chromosomes able pair identical partner meiosis68 polyploids also genetic diversity allows avoid inbreeding depression small populations71
hybridization without change chromosome number called homoploid hybrid speciation considered rare shown heliconius butterflies sunflowers polyploid speciation involves changes chromosome number common phenomenon especially plant species
gene transpositionedit
information transposable element
theodosius dobzhansky studied fruit flies early days genetic research 1930s speculated parts chromosomes switch location another might cause species split different species mapped might possible sections chromosomes relocate genome mobile sections cause sterility interspecies hybrids speciation pressure theory idea sound scientists long debated whether actually happened nature eventually competing theory involving gradual accumulation mutations shown occur nature often geneticists largely dismissed moving gene hypothesis73
however 2006 research shows jumping gene chromosome another contribute birth species74 validates reproductive isolation mechanism component speciation75
