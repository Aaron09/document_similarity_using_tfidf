icao location indicatoredit
main article icao airport code
international civil aviation organization establishes sets 4letter location indicators published icao publication 7910 used traffic control agencies identify airports weather agencies produce metar weather reports first letter indicates region example contiguous united states canada northern europe asian east australia examples icao location indicators rpll manila ninoy aquino airport kcef westover joint reserve base
iata identifieredit
main article iata airport code
international transport association uses sets 3letter iata identifiers used airline operations baggage routing ticketing specific organization scheme iata identifiers typically take abbreviation airport city manila ninoy aquino airport
united states iata identifier usually equals identifier always case prominent example sawyer international airport michigan uses identifier iata identifier
identifieredit
federal aviation administration location identifier three fivecharacter alphanumeric code identifying aviation related facilities inside united states though codes reserved managed entities1§1–21
nearly major airports assigned identifiers alphabetic threeletter codes francisco international airport minor airfields typically assigned alphanumeric characters skydive chicago airport turners falls airport private airfields assigned fourcharacter identifier 1ca9 angeles county fire department heliport location identifiers coordinated transport canada identifiers described
general authority assign threeletter identifiers except beginning letters three four character alphanumeric identifiers fiveletter identifiers united states jurisdictions department navy assigns threeletter identifiers beginning letter exclusive department transport canada assigns three character identifiers beginning block beginning letter international telecommunications jurisdiction used internally technical operations identify national airspace equipment covered identifying code system block beginning identifies united states route traffic control centers1§1–22
practice assigned identifiers always consistent current encoding rules adopted assigned identifiers unique united states canada coding system evolved time ensure safety reduce ambiguity many legacy codes remained intact1§1–2–4 even though violate currently ordered rules reason regularly publishes detailed listings codes administers1§6
general assignment patternsedit
general threeletter identifiers assigned radio call signs aeronautical navigation aids airports manned traffic control facility navigational within airport boundary airports receive scheduled route carrier military airlift service airports designated united states customs service airports entry identifiers assigned certain aviation weather reporting stations
onenumber twoletter identifiers assigned aviation weather reporting observation stations specialuse locations identifiers assigned publicuse landing facilities within united states jurisdictions meet requirements identifiers threeletter series identifier series number always first position threecharacter combination
oneletter twonumber identifiers assigned publicuse landing facilities within united states jurisdictions meet requirements identifiers threeletter series identifiers also assigned aviation weather reporting stations

oneletter twonumber identifiers keyed alphabetical letter letter appear first middle last position combination three characters letter signifies traffic control centers area assignment change centers boundaries realigned
identifiers series could conflict victor colored airway numbers assigned

twoletter twonumber identifiers assigned privateuse landing facilities united states jurisdictions meet requirements threecharacter assignments keyed twoletter post office supplemental abbreviation state associated letter code appears first middle last positions four character code
identifier system meteorology ended 1996 airways reporting code replaced metar code metar code dependent wholly icao identifier system
transport canada identifieredit
transport canada assigns three four character identifiers including three letter identifiers beginning letters areas jurisdiction identifiers designed mesh identifier system described though conflicts exist winnemucca maple creek wallops island cooking lake
direction general civil aeronautics codeedit
airfields code direction general civil aeronautics mexico designator airfields code compound alphabetic characters used identify fields civil aviation mexico characters chosen methodology iata code taking letters airfield example zacapu airstrip airfields airports regional airports private airstrips heliports boatheliports helipads platform substantial airports iata designator code used example toluca international airport although exceptions iata dgac alamos national airport sonora
russian location identifieredit
within russia 1991 within soviet union airport identifiers внутренней internal code three cyrillic letters2 used ticket sales small airports scheduled flights iata code code icao code unlike iata codes changed renaming cities former ussr 1990s saint petersburg leningrad became 2009 3000 code combinations internal code
station identifiersedit
world meteorological organization uses system fivedigit numeric station codes represent synoptic weather stations example 72295 angeles international airport first number specifies region europe russia asia east africa north america south america antarctica pacific remainder numbers regional national level
united states weather agency identifiersedit
national weather service uses several schemes identifying stations typically relies icao identifiers although several weather forecast offices wfos weather radar sites moved away airports given codes conflict existing codes typically birmingham alabama radar site replaced south city knoxville office moved nearby morristown tennessee others changed miami florida instead dallasfort worth formerly climatological applications wban weather bureau army navy system fivedigit numeric code identifying weather stations jurisdiction
recently began using fourletterplusonenumber identifiers specialized weather requirements hydrometeorological stations used usfs raws system stream gauges operated usgs report goes weather satellites operated noaa three letters mnemonic location followed first letter state followed numeral indicating alphabetical order within letter example north carolina stations mnemonic nearest town name stream combination names rearranged different mnemonics different nearby locations example ving1 gauge vinings georgia differentiated stations along chattahoochee river chag1 nearby oakdale also atlanta city limit like vinings streams atlanta peachtree creek aang1
united states force weather agency afwa acting behalf american military services assigns special icao identifiers beginning deployed units supporting realworld contingencies deployedingarrison units providing support exercises classified operating locations units requested received permanent location identifier
system still used force national climatic data center master station catalog maslib code 6digit numeric code essentially scheme station identifier adds extra digit allowing many stations indexed extra digit always referencing actual station using 5digit identifier reference stations exist vicinity maslib identifiers generally recognized outside united states
transplanted identifiersedit
rare instances identifiers transplanted locations mainly closure original airport prominent examples denkden migrated stapleton international airport denver international airport 1996 auskaus migrated austin mueller municipal airport austinbergstrom international airport 1999 cases occurred original locations closed
occasionally code discontinued entirely successor sometimes small airport closed stone mountain airport whose identifier used heliport bensalem pennsylvania another case identifiers idlewild airport york changed kjfk renamed john kennedy original kidl later reused indianola municipal airport indianola mississippi
transplanted identifiers tend poorly documented cause problems data systems software process historical records research legal work similar problem also exists broadcast callsigns
