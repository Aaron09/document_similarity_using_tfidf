overviewedit




image illustrates difference bitmap vector images bitmap image composed fixed pixels vector image composed fixed shapes picture scaling bitmap reveals pixels scaling vector image preserves shapes


development within world wide consortium since 1999 competing proposals vector graphics languages submitted consortium 1998 early working group decided develop commercial submissions create markup language informed really based them3
allows three types graphic objects vector graphic shapes paths outlines consisting straight lines curves bitmap images text graphical objects grouped styled transformed composited previously rendered objects feature includes nested transformations clipping paths alpha masks filter effects template objects drawings interactive include animation defined elements scripting accesses document object model uses styling javascript scripting text including internationalization localization appearing plain text within enhances accessibility graphics4
specification updated version 2011 mobile profiles tiny basic meant mobile devices reduced computational display capabilities5 scalable vector graphics became candidate recommendation september 2016 incorporates several features addition tiny
printingedit
though specification primarily focuses vector graphics markup language design includes basic capabilities page description language like adobes contains provisions rich graphics compatible styling purposes information needed place glyph image chosen location printed page7
scripting animationedit
main article animation
drawings dynamic interactive timebased modifications elements described smil programmed scripting language ecmascript javascript explicitly recommends smil standard animation svg8
rich event handlers onmouseover onclick assigned graphical object
compressionedit
images contain many repeated fragments text well suited lossless data compression algorithms image compressed industry standard gzip algorithm referred svgz image uses corresponding svgz filename extension conforming viewers display compressed images9 svgz file typically percent original size10 provides svgz files test conformance11

subsets full standard mainly intended user agents limited capabilities particular tiny defined highly restricted mobile devices cellphones support styling scripting17 basic defined higherlevel mobile devices smartphones
2003 3gpp international telecommunications standards group adopted tiny mandatory vector graphics media format nextgeneration phones svgt required vector graphics format support svgb optional multimedia messaging service packetswitched streaming service181920 laterwhen added required format vector graphics 3gpp multimedia subsystem ims21

functionalityedit
specification defines functional areas feature sets13

paths
simple compound shape outlines drawn curved straight lines filled outlined used clipping path paths compact coding
example “move precedes initial numeric coordinates “line precedes point line drawn command letters precede data used draw various bézier elliptical curves used close path
cases absolute coordinates follow capital letter commands relative coordinates used equivalent lowercase letters27
basic shapes
straightline paths paths made series connected straightline segments polylines well closed polygons circles ellipses drawn rectangles roundcornered rectangles also standard elements28
text
unicode character text included file expressed character data many visual effects possible specification automatically handles bidirectional text composing combination english arabic text example vertical text chinese historically written characters along curved path text around edge great seal united states29
painting
shapes filled andor outlined painted color gradient pattern fills opaque degree transparency
markers lineend features arrowheads symbols appear vertices polygon30
color
colors applied visible elements either directly fill stroke properties colors specified css2 using names like black blue hexadecimal 22ff00 decimal like rgb255255127 percentages form rgb1001005031
gradients patterns
shapes filled outlined solid colors color gradients repeating patterns color gradients linear radial circular involve number colors well repeats opacity gradients also specified patterns based predefined raster vector graphic objects repeated andor directions gradients patterns animated scripted32
since 2008 discussion3334 among professional users either gradient meshes preferably diffusion curves could usefully added specification said simple representation using diffusion curves capable representing even subtle shading effects35 diffusion curve images comparable quality coding efficiency gradient meshes simpler create according several artists used tools captured bitmaps fully automatically36 current draft includes gradient meshes37
clipping masking compositing
graphic elements including text paths basic shapes combinations used outlines define inside outside regions painted colors gradients patterns independently fully opaque clipping paths semitransparent masks composited together calculate color opacity every pixel final image using alpha blending38
filter effects39

main article filter effects

interactivity
images interact users many ways addition hyperlinks mentioned part image made receptive user interface events changes focus mouse clicks scrolling zooming image pointer keyboard document events event handlers start stop alter animations well trigger scripts response events40
linking
images contain hyperlinks documents using xlink view element fragment identifier urls link files change visible area document allows creating specific view states used zoom inout specific area limit view specific element helpful creating sprites xlink support combination element also allow linking reusing internal external elements allows less markup makes cleaner code41
scripting
