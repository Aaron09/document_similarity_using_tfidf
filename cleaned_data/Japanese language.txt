japanese vowels pure—that diphthongs monophthongs unusual vowel high back vowel listen help·info like compressed instead rounded japanese five vowels vowel length phonemic short long version elongated vowels usually denoted line vowel macron rōmaji repeated vowel character hiragana chōonpu succeeding vowel katakana
japanese consonants several allophones give impression larger inventory sounds however allophones since become phonemic example japanese language including first half 20th century phonemic sequence palatalized realized phonetically approximately listen help·info however distinct evidenced words like western style chii tɕii social status
japanese language technically lateral apical postalveolar flap particular interest sounding english speakers something retroflex depending position word also notable unless starts sentence pronounced like sing kanto prestige dialect eastern dialects
syllabic structure phonotactics simple consonant clusters allowed within syllable consist subset consonants plus type cluster occurs onsets however consonant clusters across syllables allowed long consonants nasal followed homorganic consonant consonant length gemination also phonemic
phonology japanese also includes pitch accent system system helps differentiate words identical hiragana spelling words different japanese dialects example words identical hiragana would words haꜜshi chopsticks hashiꜜ bridge spelled hashi hiragana stresses differentiate words38

main article japanese grammar
sentence structure
japanese word order classified subject–object–verb unlike many indoeuropean languages strict rule word order verb must placed sentence possibly followed sentenceend particles japanese sentence elements marked particles identify grammatical functions
basic sentence structure topic–comment example kochira tanakasan desu こちらは田中さんです kochira topic sentence indicated particle verb desu contraction polite form arimasu copula commonly translated though verbs translated though technically holds meaning used give sentence politeness phrase tanakasan desu comment sentence literally translates person mrms tanaka thus japanese like many asian languages often called topicprominent language means strong tendency indicate topic separately subject always coincide sentence hana nagai 象は鼻が長い literally means elephants noses isare long topic elephant subject hana nose
japanese subject object sentence need stated obvious context result grammatical permissiveness tendency gravitate towards brevity japanese speakers tend omit pronouns theory inferred previous sentence therefore understood context example hanaga nagai would mean noses long nagai would mean long single verb complete sentence yatta やったi addition since adjectives form predicate japanese sentence single adjective complete sentence urayamashii 羨ましいim jealous
language words typically translated pronouns used frequently pronouns indoeuropean languages function differently cases japanese relies special verb forms auxiliary verbs indicate direction benefit action indicate outgroup gives benefit ingroup indicate ingroup gives benefit outgroup ingroup includes speaker outgroup boundary depends context example oshiete moratta 教えてもらった literally explained benefit outgroup ingroup means heshethey explained meus similarly oshiete ageta 教えてあげた literally explained benefit ingroup outgroup means explained himherthem beneficiary auxiliary verbs thus serve function comparable pronouns prepositions indoeuropean languages indicate actor recipient action
japanese pronouns also function differently modern indoeuropean pronouns like nouns take modifiers noun instance english

amazed street grammatically incorrect insertion pronoun

grammatically essentially thing japanese

驚いた彼は道を走っていった。
odoroita kare michi hashitte itta grammatically correct

partly words evolved regular nouns kimi lord anata side yonder boku servant linguists classify japanese pronouns pronouns rather referential nouns much like spanish usted contracted vuestra merced flattering majestic plural grace portuguese senhor japanese personal pronouns generally used situations requiring special emphasis
choice words used pronouns correlated speaker social situation spoken women alike formal situation generally refer watashi private watakushi also rougher intimate conversation much likely word oneself boku similarly different words anata kimi omae formally used refer listener depending listeners relative social position degree familiarity speaker listener used different social relationships word positive intimate respectful negative distant disrespectful connotations
japanese often titles person referred pronouns would used english example speaking ones teacher appropriate sensei teacher inappropriate anata anata used refer people equal lower status ones teacher higher status
inflection conjugation
japanese nouns grammatical number gender article aspect noun refer single book several books hito mean person people tree trees number important indicated providing quantity often counter word rarely adding suffix sometimes duplication hitobito usually written iteration mark words people usually understood singular thus tanakasan usually means mrms tanaka words refer people animals made indicate group individuals addition collective suffix noun suffix indicates group tachi true plural meaning closer english phrase company group described tanakasantachi include people named tanaka japanese nouns effectively plural hitobito people wareware weus word tomodachi friend considered singular although plural form
verbs conjugated show tenses past present nonpast used present future verbs represent ongoing process form indicates continuous progressive aspect similar suffix english others represent change state form indicates perfect aspect example kite means come still tabete means eating
questions interrogative pronoun yesno questions structure affirmative sentences intonation rising formal register question particle added example desu いいです becomes desuka いいですか。 informal tone sometimes particle added instead show personal interest speaker dōshite konaino arent coming simple queries formed simply mentioning topic interrogative intonation call hearers attention kore onamae お名前は？ whats name
negatives formed inflecting verb example taberu パンを食べる。 bread bread becomes tabenai パンを食べない。 bread bread plain negative forms actually iadjectives inflect tabenakatta パンを食べなかった。 bread
socalled verb form used variety purposes either progressive perfect aspect combining verbs temporal sequence asagohan tabete sugu dekakeru breakfast leave simple commands conditional statements permissions dekaketemo
word plain desu polite copula verb corresponds approximately english often takes roles including marker tense verb conjugated past form datta plain deshita polite comes iadjectives verbs carry tense japanese additional common verbs used indicate existence contexts property negative negative inai inanimate animate things respectively example neko theres kangaega havent good idea
verb suru polite form shimasu often used make verbs nouns ryōri suru cook benkyō suru study productive creating modern slang words japanese also huge number compound verbs express concepts described english using verb adverbial particle tobidasu flee tobu jump dasu emit
three types adjective japanese adjectives

keiyōshi adjectives conjugating ending atsui become past 暑かった atsukatta negative 暑くない atsuku note also adjective become past 暑くなかった atsuku nakatta

atsui


形容動詞 keiyōdōshi adjectives followed form copula usually example strange

変なひと hito strange person


rentaishi also called true adjectives

yama mountain



keiyōshi keiyōdōshi predicate sentences example

ご飯が熱い。 gohan atsui rice
彼は変だ。 kare strange

inflect though show full range conjugation found true verbs rentaishi modern japanese number unlike words limited directly modifying nouns never predicate sentences examples include ookina kono iwayuru socalled taishita amazing
keiyōdōshi keiyōshi form adverbs following case keiyōdōshi

変になる naru become strange

changing case keiyōshi

熱くなる atsuku naru become

grammatical function nouns indicated postpositions also called particles include example

nominative case


彼がやった。kare yatta


dative case


田中さんにあげて下さい。 tanakasan agete kudasai please give tanaka

also used lative case indicating motion location

日本に行きたい。 nihon ikitai want japan


however commonly used lative case


パーティーへ行かないか。 pātī ikanai wont party


genitive case nominalizing phrases


私のカメラ。 watashi kamera camera
スキーに行くのが好きです。 sukīni suki desu like going skiing


accusative case


何を食べますか。 nani tabemasu


topic coexist case markers listed overrides cases


私は寿司がいいです。 watashi sushi desu literally sushi good nominative marker watashi hidden

note subtle difference japanese cannot derived english language distinction sentence topic subject made indicates topic rest sentence describes acts upon carries implication subject indicated unique part larger group

ikedasan yonjūni ikeda fortytwo years others group also

absence often means subject focus sentence

ikedasan yonjūni ikeda fortytwo years reply implicit explicit question group fortytwo years

politeness
main article honorific speech japanese

japanese language express differing levels social status differences social position determined variety factors including experience even psychological state person asking favour tends politely person lower position expected polite form speech whereas person might plainer form strangers also speak politely japanese children rarely polite speech teens point expected begin speaking adult manner uchisoto
whereas teineigo polite language commonly inflectional system sonkeigo respectful language kenjōgo humble language often employ many special honorific humble alternate verbs becomes ikimasu polite form replaced irassharu honorific speech ukagau mairu humble speech
difference honorific humble speech particularly pronounced japanese language humble language used talk oneself ones group company family whilst honorific language mostly used describing interlocutor group example suffix miss example honorific language used talk oneself talking someone ones company external person since company speakers ingroup speaking directly ones superior ones company speaking employees within ones company superior japanese person vocabulary inflections honorific register refer ingroup superior speech actions speaking person another company member outgroup however japanese person plain humble register refer speech actions ingroup superiors short register used japanese refer person speech actions particular individual varies depending relationship either ingroup outgroup speaker listener well depending relative status speaker listener thirdperson referents
nouns japanese language made polite addition prefix generally used words native japanese origin whereas affixed words chinese derivation cases prefix become fixed part word included even regular speech gohan cooked rice meal construction often indicates deference either items owner object example word tomodachi friend would become otomodachi referring friend someone higher status though mothers often form refer childrens friends hand polite speaker sometimes refer mizu water omizu order show politeness
japanese people employ politeness indicate lack familiarity polite forms acquaintances relationship becomes intimate longer occurs regardless social class gender
