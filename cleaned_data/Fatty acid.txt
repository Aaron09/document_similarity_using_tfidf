unsaturated fatty acidsedit
main article unsaturated
unsaturated fatty acids double bonds carbon atoms pairs carbon atoms connected double bonds saturated adding hydrogen atoms converting double bonds single bonds therefore double bonds called unsaturated
carbon atoms chain bound next either side double bond occur trans configuration


configuration means hydrogen atoms adjacent double bond stick side chain rigidity double bond freezes conformation case isomer causes chain bend restricts conformational freedom fatty acid double bonds chain configuration less flexibility chain many bonds becomes quite curved accessible conformations example oleic acid double bond kink whereas linoleic acid double bonds pronounced bend αlinolenic acid three double bonds favors hooked shape effect restricted environments fatty acids part phospholipid lipid bilayer triglycerides lipid droplets bonds limit ability fatty acids closely packed therefore affect melting temperature membrane
trans
trans configuration contrast means adjacent hydrogen atoms opposite sides chain result cause chain bend much shape similar straight saturated fatty acids

naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids double bond three carbon atoms bonds fatty acids trans configuration trans fats found nature result human processing hydrogenation
differences geometry various types unsaturated fatty acids well saturated unsaturated fatty acids play important role biological processes construction biological structures cell membranes
