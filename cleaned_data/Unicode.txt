unicodes success unifying character sets widespread predominant internationalization localization computer software standard implemented many recent technologies including modern operating systems java programming languages framework
unicode implemented different character encodings unicode standard defines utf8 utf16 utf32 several encodings commonly used encodings utf8 utf16 ucs2 precursor utf16
utf8 dominantly used websites uses byte first code points bytes characters first unicode code points ascii characters ascii text utf8 text
ucs2 simply uses bytes bits character encode first 65536 code points socalled basic multilingual plane 1114112 code points planes possible 120000 code points defined many unicode characters beyond reach ucs2 therefore ucs2 obsolete though still widely used software utf16 extends ucs2 using 16bit encoding ucs2 basic multilingual plane 4byte encoding planes long contains code points reserved range u0d800u0dfff ucs2 text valid utf16 text

unicode explicit transcending limitations traditional character encodings defined 8859 standard find wide usage various countries world remain largely incompatible many traditional character encodings share common problem allow bilingual computer processing usually using latin characters local script multilingual computer processing computer processing arbitrary scripts mixed
unicode intent encodes underlying characters—graphemes graphemelike units—rather variant glyphs renderings characters case chinese characters sometimes leads controversies distinguishing underlying character variant glyphs unification
text processing unicode takes role providing unique code point—a number glyph—for character words unicode represents character abstract leaves visual rendering size shape font style software browser word processor simple becomes complicated however concessions made unicodes designers hope encouraging rapid adoption unicode
first code points made identical content iso88591 make trivial convert existing western text many essentially identical characters encoded multiple times different code points preserve distinctions used legacy encodings therefore allow conversion encodings unicode back without losing information example fullwidth forms section code points encompasses full latin alphabet separate main latin alphabet section chinese japanese korean fonts latin characters rendered width ideographs rather half width examples duplicate characters unicode
historyedit
based experiences xerox character code standard xccs since 19802 origins unicode date 1987 becker xerox collins mark davis apple started investigating practicalities creating universal character set3 additional input peter fenwick dave opstad2 becker published draft proposal internationalmultilingual text character encoding system august 1988 tentatively called unicode explained name unicode intended suggest unique unified universal encoding2
document entitled unicode becker outlined 16bit character model2

unicode intended address need workable reliable world text encoding unicode could roughly described widebody ascii stretched bits encompass characters worlds living languages properly engineered design bits character sufficient purpose

original 16bit design based assumption scripts characters modern would need encoded2

unicode gives higher priority ensuring utility future preserving past antiquities unicode aims first instance characters published modern text union newspapers magazines printed world 1988 whose number undoubtedly 16384 beyond modernuse characters others defined obsolete rare better candidates privateuse registration congesting public list generally useful unicodes

readymade versus composite charactersedit
unicode includes mechanism modifying character shape greatly extends supported glyph repertoire covers combining diacritical marks inserted main character multiple combining diacritics stacked character unicode also contains precomposed versions letterdiacritic combinations normal make conversion legacy encodings simpler allow applications unicode internal text format without implement combining characters example represented unicode u0065 latin small letter followed u0301 combining acute accent also represented precomposed character u00e9 latin small letter acute thus many cases users multiple ways encoding character deal unicode provides mechanism canonical equivalence
example arises hangul korean alphabet unicode provides mechanism composing hangul syllables individual subcomponents known hangul jamo however also provides 11172 combinations precomposed syllables made common jamo
ideographs currently codes precomposed form still ideographs comprise simpler elements often called radicals english principle unicode could decomposed hangul would greatly reduced number required code points allowing display virtually every conceivable ideograph might away problems caused unification similar idea used input methods cangjie wubi however attempts character encoding stumbled fact ideographs decompose simply regularly hangul

newlinesedit
unicode partially addresses newline problem occurs trying read text file different platforms unicode defines large number characters conforming applications recognize line terminators
terms newline unicode introduced u2028 line separator u2029 paragraph separator attempt provide unicode solution encoding paragraphs lines semantically potentially replacing various platform solutions unicode provide around historical platform dependent solutions nonetheless unicode solutions adopted unicode line paragraph separators sole canonical line ending characters however common approach solving issue newline normalization achieved cocoa text system also html recommendations approach every possible newline character converted internally common newline really matter since internal operation rendering words text system correctly treat character newline regardless inputs actual encoding

unicode criticized failing separately encode older alternative forms kanji critics argue complicates processing ancient japanese uncommon japanese names often fact unicode encodes characters rather glyphs visual representations basic character often vary language another unification glyphs leads perception languages basic character representation merged56clarification needed several attempts create alternative encodings preserve stylistic differences chinese japanese korean characters opposition unicodes policy unification example tron although widely adopted japan users need handle historical japanese text favor
although repertoire fewer 21000 characters earliest version unicode largely limited characters common modern usage unicode includes 70000 characters work continuing thousands historic dialectal characters used china japan korea taiwan vietnam
modern font technology provides means address practical issue needing depict unified character terms collection alternative glyph representations form unicode variation sequences example advanced typographic tables opentype permit number alternative glyph representations selected performing character glyph mapping process case information provided within plain text designate alternate character form select
