since accurate measurement essential many fields since measurements necessarily approximations great deal effort must taken make measurements accurate possible example consider problem measuring time takes object fall distance metre using physics shown gravitational field earth take object second fall metre however following sources error arise

computation used acceleration gravity metres second squared fts2 measurement exact precise significant digits
earths gravitational field varies slightly depending height level factors
computation seconds involved extracting square root mathematical operation required rounding number significant digits case significant digits

additionally sources experimental error include

carelessness
determining exact time object released exact time hits ground
measurement height measurement time involve error
resistance

scientific experiments must carried great care eliminate much error possible keep error estimates realistic
