first asteroid discovered ceres originally considered planetnote followed discovery similar bodies equipment time appeared points light like stars showing little planetary disc though readily distinguishable stars apparent motions prompted astronomer william herschel propose term asteroidnote coined greek ἀστεροειδής asteroeidēs meaning starlike starshaped derived ancient greek ἀστήρ astēr star planet early second half nineteenth century terms asteroid planet always qualified minor still used interchangeably note

traditionally small bodies orbiting classified comets asteroids meteoroids anything smaller meters across called meteoroid beech steels 1995 paper proposed meteoroid definition including size limits2122 term asteroid greek word starlike never formal definition broader term minor planet preferred international astronomical union
