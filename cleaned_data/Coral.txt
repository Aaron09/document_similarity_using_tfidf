corals predominantly reproduce sexually hermatypic corals stony corals form single gonochoristic colonies rest hermaphroditic24
broadcastersedit
hermatypic corals broadcast spawn releasing gametes—eggs sperm—into water spread offspring gametes fuse fertilization form microscopic larva called planula typically pink elliptical shape typical coral colony forms several thousand larvae year overcome odds formation colony25

synchronous spawning typical coral reef often even multiple species present corals spawn night synchrony essential male female gametes meet corals rely environmental cues varying species species determine proper time release gametes water cues involve temperature change lunar cycle length possibly chemical signalling24 synchronous spawning form hybrids perhaps involved coral speciation26 immediate often sunset cues release24 spawning event visually dramatic clouding usually clear water gametes

planulaeedit

asexualedit




basal plates calices orbicella annularis showing multiplication budding small central plate division large double plate






tabulate coral aulopora devonian showing initial budding


within coral head genetically identical polyps reproduce asexually either budding gemmation dividing whether longitudinally transversely
budding involves splitting smaller polyp adult25 polyp grows forms body parts distance adult polyps grows coenosarc common body colony budding intratentacular oral discs producing samesized polyps within ring tentacles extratentacular base producing smaller polyp
division forms polyps become large original longitudinal division begins polyp broadens divides coelenteron body effectively splitting along length mouth divides tentacles form polyps thus created generate missing body parts exoskeleton transversal division occurs polyps exoskeleton divide transversally parts means basal disc bottom oral disc polyps must separately generate missing pieces
asexual reproduction offers benefits high reproductive rate delaying senescence replacement dead modules well geographical distribution29
colony divisionedit
whole colonies reproduce asexually forming colonies genotype possible mechanisms include fission bailout fragmentation fission occurs corals especially among family fungiidae colony splits colonies early developmental stages bailout occurs single polyp abandons colony settles different substrate create colony fragmentation involves individuals broken colony storms disruptions separated individuals start colonies30
