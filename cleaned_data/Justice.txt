deterrence credible threat punishment might lead people make different choices welldesigned threats might lead people make choices maximize welfare matches strong intuitions punishment generally proportional crime
rehabilitation punishment might make people better ones utilitarian person mean person whos likely cause things like suffering utilitarianism could recommend punishment changes someone less likely cause things
securityincapacitation perhaps people irredeemable causers things imprisoning might maximize welfare limiting opportunities cause harm therefore benefit lies within protecting society

reason punishment maximization welfare punishment whomever whatever form severity needed meet goal sometimes justify punishing innocent inflicting disproportionately severe punishments best consequences overall perhaps executing suspected shoplifters live television would effective deterrent shoplifting instance also suggests punishment might turn never right depending facts actual consequences has10
