permian–triassic extinction event labeled significant extinction event plot marine genera produce large numbers fossils


main article permian–triassic extinction event
permian ended extensive extinction event recorded paleontology permian–triassic extinction event marine species became extinct well land organisms also known mass extinction insects827 recovery permiantriassic extinction event protracted land ecosystems took million years recover9 trilobites thrived since cambrian times finally became extinct permian nautiluses species cephalopods surprisingly survived occurrence
evidence magma form flood basalt poured onto surface called siberian traps thousands years contributing environmental stress mass extinction reduced coastal habitat highly increased aridity probably also contributed based amount lava estimated produced period worstcase scenario release enough carbon dioxide eruptions raise world temperatures five degrees celsius14
another hypothesis involves ocean venting hydrogen sulfide portions deep ocean periodically lose dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria live without oxygen flourish produce hydrogen sulfide enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates anoxic zone rise atmosphere oxidizing gases atmosphere would destroy toxic hydrogen sulfide would soon consume atmospheric available hydrogen sulfide levels might increased dramatically hundred years models event indicate would destroy ozone upper atmosphere allowing ultraviolet radiation kill species survived toxic gas28 course species metabolize hydrogen sulfide
another hypothesis builds flood basalt eruption theory increase temperature five degrees celsius would enough explain death life warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures frozen methane reservoirs ocean floor near coastlines melted expelling enough methane among potent greenhouse gases atmosphere raise world temperatures additional five degrees celsius frozen methane hypothesis helps explain increase carbon12 levels found midway permian–triassic boundary layer also helps explain first phase layers extinctions landbased second marinebased starting right increase levels third landbased again29
even speculative hypothesis intense radiation nearby supernova responsible extinctions30
hypothesised huge meteorite impact crater wilkes land crater diameter around kilometers antarctica represents impact event related extinction31 crater located depth kilometers beneath wilkes land eastern antarctica scientists speculate impact caused permian–triassic extinction event although bracketed million million years also speculate contributed separation australia antarctic landmass part supercontinent called gondwana levels iridium quartz fracturing permiantriassic layer approach cretaceous–paleogene boundary layer given greater proportion species individual organisms became extinct former doubt cast significance meteorite impact creating latter doubt cast theory based fossils greenland show extinction gradual lasting eighty thousand years three distinct phases32
many scientists argue permian–triassic extinction event caused combination hypotheses factors formation pangaea decreased number coastal habitats contributed extinction many cladescitation needed
