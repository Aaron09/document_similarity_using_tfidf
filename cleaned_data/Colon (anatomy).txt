sections colon


mammals colon consists five sections cecum plus ascending colon transverse colon descending colon sigmoid colon rectum1
sections colon

ascending colon including cecum appendix
transverse colon including colic flexures transverse mesocolon
descending colon
sigmoid colon sshaped region large intestine

parts colon either intraperitoneal behind retroperitoneum retroperitoneal organs general complete covering peritoneum fixed location intraperitoneal organs completely surrounded peritoneum therefore mobile12 colon ascending colon descending colon rectum retroperitoneal cecum appendix transverse colon sigmoid colon intraperitoneal13 important affects organs easily accessed surgery laparotomy
cecum appendixedit
cecum first section colon involved digestion appendix develops embryologically structure colon involved digestion considered part gutassociated lymphoid tissue function appendix uncertain sources believe appendix role housing sample colons microflora able help repopulate colon bacteria microflora damaged course immune reaction
ascending colonedit
ascending colon first four sections large intestine connected small intestine section bowel called cecum ascending colon runs upwards abdominal cavity toward transverse colon approximately eight inches
main functions colon remove water nutrients waste material recycle waste material exits small intestine ileocecal valve move cecum ascending colon process extraction starts unwanted waste material moved upwards toward transverse colon action peristalsis ascending colon sometimes attached appendix gerlachs valve appendix traditionally seen vestigial organ shown high concentration lymphatic cells ruminants ascending colon known spiral colon141516 taking account ages sexes colon cancer occurs often 4117
transverse colonedit

histological section


large intestine absorbs water remaining absorbable nutrients food sending indigestible matter rectum colon absorbs vitamins created colonic bacteria vitamin especially important daily ingestion vitamin normally enough maintain adequate blood coagulation vitamin thiamine riboflavin also compacts feces stores fecal matter rectum discharged anus defecation large intestine also secretes chloride secretion increases cystic fibrosis recycling various nutrients takes place colon examples include fermentation carbohydrates short chain fatty acids urea cycling29citation needed
appendix attached inferior surface cecum contains small amount mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue gives appendix undetermined role immunity however appendix known important fetal life contains endocrine cells release biogenic amines peptide hormones important homeostasis early growth development30 appendix removed apparent damage consequence patientcitation needed
time chyme reached tube nutrients water absorbed body point electrolytes like sodium magnesium chloride left well indigestible parts ingested food large part ingested amylose starch shielded digestion heretofore dietary fiber largely indigestible carbohydrate either soluble insoluble form chyme moves large intestine remaining water removed chyme mixed mucus bacteria known flora becomes feces ascending colon receives fecal material liquid muscles colon move watery waste material forward slowly absorb excess water causing stools gradually solidify move along descending colon31
bacteria break fiber nourishment create acetate propionate butyrate waste products turn used cell lining colon nourishment32 protein made available humans perhaps undigested carbohydrate thus becomes available though vary diet33 animals including apes primates proportionally larger colons made available thus permitting higher portion plant material diet large intestine34 produces digestive enzymes chemical digestion completed small intestine chyme reaches large intestine colon varies slightly acidic neutral35
standing gradient osmosisedit
water absorption colon typically proceeds transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient standing gradient osmosis reabsorption water osmotic gradient intestines cells occupying intestinal lining pump sodium ions intercellular space raising osmolarity intercellular fluid hypertonic fluid creates osmotic pressure drives water lateral intercellular spaces osmosis tight junctions adjacent cells turn moves across basement membrane capillaries sodium ions pumped intercellular fluid36 although water travels osmotic gradient individual step overall water usually travels osmotic gradient pumping sodium ions intercellular fluid allows large intestine absorb water despite blood capillaries hypotonic compared fluid within intestinal lumen
floraedit
main article flora
large intestine houses species bacteria perform variety functions well fungi protozoa archaea species diversity varies geography diet37 microbes human distal often number vicinity trillion weigh around grams pounds mass mostly symbiotic microbes recently called latest human organ discovered words forgotten organ38
large intestine absorbs products formed bacteria inhabiting region undigested polysaccharides fiber metabolized shortchain fatty acids bacteria large intestine absorbed passive diffusion bicarbonate large intestine secretes helps neutralize increased acidity resulting formation fatty acids39
bacteria also produce large amounts vitamins especially vitamin biotin vitamin absorption blood although source vitamins general provides small part daily requirement makes significant contribution dietary vitamin intake individual depends absorption vitamins formed bacteria large intestine become vitamindeficient treated antibiotics inhibit vitamin producing species bacteria well intended diseasecausing bacteria40
bacterial products include flatus mixture nitrogen carbon dioxide small amounts gases hydrogen methane hydrogen sulfide bacterial fermentation undigested polysaccharides produces fecal odor indoles metabolized amino acid tryptophan normal flora also essential development certain tissues including cecum lymphaticscitation needed
also involved production crossreactive antibodies antibodies produced immune system normal flora also effective related pathogens thereby preventing infection invasion

colonoscopy similar sigmoidoscopyâ€”the difference related parts colon examine colonoscopy allows examination entire colon 1200â€“1500 length sigmoidoscopy allows examination distal portion colon sufficient benefits cancer survival colonoscopy limited detection lesions distal portion colon454647
sigmoidoscopy often used screening procedure full colonoscopy often done conjunction fecal occult blood test fobt screened patients referred colonoscopy48
virtual colonoscopy uses imagery reconstructed computed tomography scans nuclear magnetic resonance scans also possible totally noninvasive medical test although standard still investigation regarding diagnostic abilities furthermore virtual colonoscopy allow therapeutic maneuvers polyptumour removal biopsy visualization lesions smaller millimeters growth polyp detected using colonography standard colonoscopy would still need performed additionally surgeons lately using term pouchoscopy refer colonoscopy ileoanal pouch
animalsedit
large intestine truly distinct tetrapods almost always separated small intestine ileocaecal valve vertebrates however relatively short structure running directly anus although noticeably wider small intestine although caecum present amniotes mammals remainder large intestine develop true colon49
small mammals colon straight tetrapods majority mammalian species divided ascending descending portions distinct transverse colon typically present primates however taeniae coli accompanying haustra found either carnivorans ruminants rectum mammals monotremes derived cloaca vertebrates therefore truly homologous rectum found species49
fish true large intestine simply short rectum connecting digestive part cloaca sharks includes rectal gland secretes salt help animal maintain osmotic balance seawater gland somewhat resembles caecum structure homologous structure49
