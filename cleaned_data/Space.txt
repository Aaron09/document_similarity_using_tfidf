gottfried leibniz


seventeenth century philosophy space time emerged central issue epistemology metaphysics heart gottfried leibniz german philosophermathematician isaac newton english physicistmathematician opposing theories space rather entity independently exists matter leibniz held space collection spatial relations objects world space results places taken together5 unoccupied regions could objects thus spatial relations places leibniz space idealised abstraction relations individual entities possible locations therefore could continuous must discrete6 space could thought similar relations family members although people family related another relations exist independently people7 leibniz argued space could exist independently objects world implies difference universes exactly alike except location material world universe since would observational telling universes apart according identity indiscernibles would real difference according principle sufficient reason theory space implied could possible universes must therefore wrong8




isaac newton


newton took space relations material objects based position observation experimentation relationist real difference inertial motion object travels constant velocity noninertial motion velocity changes time since spatial measurements relative objects motions newton argued since noninertial motion generates forces must absolute9 used example water spinning bucket demonstrate argument water bucket hung rope spin starts flat surface bucket continues spin surface water becomes concave buckets spinning stopped surface water remains concave continues spin concave surface therefore apparently result relative motion bucket water10 instead newton argued must result noninertial motion relative space several centuries bucket argument considered decisive showing space must exist independently matter
kant




immanuel kant


eighteenth century german philosopher immanuel kant developed theory knowledge knowledge space priori synthetic11 according kant knowledge space synthetic statements space simply true virtue meaning words statement work kant rejected view space must either substance relation instead came conclusion space time discovered humans objective features world imposed part framework organizing experience12

henri poincaré french mathematician physicist late 19th century introduced important insight attempted demonstrate futility attempt discover geometry applies space experiment15 considered predicament would face scientists confined surface imaginary large sphere particular properties known sphereworld world temperature taken vary objects expand contract similar proportions different places sphere suitable falloff temperature scientists measuring rods determine angles triangle deceived thinking inhabit plane rather spherical surface16 fact scientists cannot principle determine whether inhabit plane sphere poincaré argued true debate whether real space euclidean geometry used describe space matter convention17 since euclidean geometry simpler noneuclidean geometry assumed former would always used describe true geometry world18
einstein




albert einstein


1905 albert einstein published special theory relativity concept space time viewed single construct known spacetime theory speed light vacuum observers—which result events appear simultaneous particular observer simultaneous another observer observers moving respect another moreover observer measure moving clock tick slowly stationary respect objects measured shortened direction moving respect observer
subsequently einstein worked general theory relativity theory gravity interacts spacetime instead viewing gravity force field acting spacetime einstein suggested modifies geometric structure spacetime itself19 according general theory time goes slowly places lower gravitational potentials rays light bend presence gravitational field scientists studied behaviour binary pulsars confirming predictions einsteins theories noneuclidean geometry usually used describe spacetime

space fundamental quantities physics meaning cannot defined quantities nothing fundamental known present hand related fundamental quantities thus similar fundamental quantities like time mass space explored measurement experiment
relativity
main article theory relativity
einsteins work relativistic physics time space viewed independent dimensions einsteins discoveries showed relativity motion space time mathematically combined object–spacetime turns distances space time separately invariant respect lorentz coordinate transformations distances minkowski spacetime along spacetime intervals are—which justifies name
addition time space dimensions viewed exactly equivalent minkowski spacetime freely move space time thus time space coordinates treated differently special relativity time sometimes considered imaginary coordinate general relativity different signs assigned time space components spacetime metric
furthermore einsteins general theory relativity postulated spacetime geometrically distorted curved near gravitationally significant masses21
consequence postulate follows equations general relativity prediction moving ripples spacetime called gravitational waves indirect evidence waves found motions hulse–taylor binary system example experiments attempting directly measure waves ongoing
cosmology
main article shape universe
relativity theory leads cosmological question shape universe space came appears space created bang billion years ago22 expanding ever since overall shape space known space known expanding rapidly cosmic inflation
spatial measurement
main article measurement
measurement physical space long important although earlier societies developed measuring systems international system units common system units used measuring space almost universally used
currently standard space interval called standard meter simply meter defined distance traveled light vacuum time interval exactly 1299792458 second definition coupled present definition second based special theory relativity speed light plays role fundamental constant nature
geographical space
also spatial analysis
geography branch science concerned identifying describing earth utilizing spatial awareness understand things exist specific locations cartography mapping spaces allow better navigation visualization purposes locational device geostatistics apply statistical concepts collected spatial data create estimate unobserved phenomena
geographical space often considered land relation ownership usage space seen property territory cultures assert rights individual terms ownership cultures identify communal approach land ownership still cultures australian aboriginals rather asserting ownership rights land invert relationship consider fact owned land spatial planning method regulating space landlevel decisions made regional national international levels space also impact human cultural behavior important factor architecture impact design buildings structures farming
ownership space restricted land ownership airspace waters decided internationally forms ownership recently asserted spaces—for example radio bands electromagnetic spectrum cyberspace
public space term used define areas land collectively owned community managed name delegated bodies spaces open private property land culturally owned individual company pleasure
abstract space term used geography refer hypothetical space characterized complete homogeneity modeling activity behavior conceptual tool used limit extraneous variables terrain
psychology
psychologists first began study space perceived middle 19th century concerned studies regard distinct branch psychology psychologists analyzing perception space concerned recognition objects physical appearance interactions perceived example visual space
specialized topics studied include amodal perception object permanence perception surroundings important necessary relevance survival especially regards hunting self preservation well simply ones idea personal space
several spacerelated phobias identified including agoraphobia fear open spaces astrophobia fear celestial space claustrophobia fear enclosed spaces
understanding threedimensional space humans thought learned infancy using unconscious inference closely related handeye coordination visual ability perceive world three dimensions called depth perception
