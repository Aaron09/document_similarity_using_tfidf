goal research process produce knowledge deepen understanding topic issue process takes three main forms although previously discussed boundaries obscure

exploratory research helps identify define problem question
constructive research tests theories proposes solutions problem question
empirical research tests feasibility solution using empirical evidence

major types empirical research design qualitative research quantitative research researchers choose qualitative quantitative methods according nature research topic want investigate research questions answer

qualitative research
involves understanding human behavior reasons govern behavior asking broad question collecting data form words images video analyzed searching themes type research aims investigate question without attempting quantifiably measure variables look potential relationships variables viewed restrictive testing hypotheses expensive timeconsuming typically limited single research subjectscitation needed qualitative research often used method exploratory research basis later quantitative research hypothesescitation needed qualitative research linked philosophical theoretical stance social constructionism

social media posts used qualitative research38

quantitative research
involves systematic empirical investigation quantitative properties phenomena relationships asking narrow question collecting numerical data analyze utilizing statistical methods quantitative research designs experimental correlational survey descriptive39 statistics derived quantitative research used establish existence associative causal relationships variables quantitative research linked philosophical theoretical stance positivism

quantitative data collection methods rely random sampling structured data collection instruments diverse experiences predetermined response categoriescitation needed methods produce results easy summarize compare generalizecitation needed quantitative research concerned testing hypotheses derived theory able estimate size phenomenon interest
research question people participants randomly assigned different treatments quantitative study considered true experimentcitation needed feasible researcher collect data participant situational characteristics statistically control influence dependent outcome variable intent generalize research participants larger population researcher employ probability sampling select participants40
either qualitative quantitative research researchers collect primary secondary data primary data data collected specifically research interviews questionnaires secondary data data already exists census data reused research good ethical research practice secondary data wherever possible41
mixedmethod research research includes qualitative quantitative elements using primary secondary data becoming common42 method benefits using method alone cannot offer example researcher choose conduct qualitative study follow quantitative study gain additional insights43
data brought impacts research methods many researchers much effort data collection furthermore methods analyze easily available huge amounts data also developed44

nonempirical research

nonempirical theoretical research approach involves development theory opposed using observation experimentation nonempirical research seeks solutions problems using existing knowledge source however mean ideas innovations cannot found within pool existing established knowledge nonempirical research absolute alternative empirical research used together strengthen research approach neither less effective since particular purpose science typically empirical research produces observations need explained theoretical research tries explain generates empirically testable hypotheses hypotheses tested empirically giving observations need explanation scientific method
simple example nonempirical task prototyping drug using differentiated application existing knowledge another development business process form flow chart texts ingredients established knowledge much cosmological research theoretical nature mathematics research rely externally available data rather seeks prove theorems mathematical objects
