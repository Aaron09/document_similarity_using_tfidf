equipment available observation teams progressed prismatic compass handheld tripod mounted binoculars sometimes optical rangefinders
special equipment locating hostile artillery flash spotting notably sound ranging appeared world latter undergone increasing refinement technology improved joined radar world
mid1970s several armies started equipping artillery observation teams laser rangefinders ground surveillance radars night vision devices soon followed inertial orienting navigating devices improve accuracy target locations global positioning system provided smaller cheaper means quick accurate fixation target acquisition devices
specialised units ground surveillance radars unattended ground sensors observation patrols operating depth also used
targets depth also acquired intelligence processes using various sources agencies humint sigint elint imint
laser guided shells require laser target designators usually observation teams ground installations possible
specialised artillery observation vehicles appeared world greatly increased sophistication since time

control sometimes called tactical fire control primarily concerned targeting allotment fire units targets vital target within range many fire units number fire units needed depends nature target circumstances purpose engagement targeting concerned selecting right weapons right quantities achieve required effects target allotment attempts address artillery dilemma—important targets rarely urgent urgent targets rarely important course importance matter perspective important divisional commander rarely important infantry platoon commander

three main types artillery guns howitzers mortars 20th century guns howitzers steadily merged artillery making distinction terms somewhat meaningless 20th century true guns calibers larger become rare artillery main users tanks ships residual antiaircraft coastal guns term cannon united states generic term includes guns howitzers mortars used english speaking armies
traditional definitions differentiated guns howitzers terms maximum elevation well less opposed close greater number charges charge higher lower muzzle velocity sometimes indicated barrel length three criteria give eight possible combinations guns howitzers however modern howitzers higher velocities longer barrels equivalent guns first half 20th century
true guns characterized long range maximum elevation significantly less high muzzle velocity hence relatively long barrel smooth bore rifling single charge latter often fixed ammunition projectile locked cartridge case generally accepted minimum muzzle velocity barrel length associated

howitzers fire maximum elevations least close elevations normal modern howitzers howitzers also choice charges meaning elevation angle fire achieve different range depending charge used rifled bores lower muzzle velocities shorter barrels equivalent guns means deliver fire steep angle descent multicharge capability ammunition mostly separate loading projectile propellant loaded separately
leaves combinations three criteria termed howitzers term first used 1930s howitzers relatively high maximum muzzle velocities introduced never became widely accepted armies electing widen definition howitzer 1960s equipments maximum elevations multicharge quite high maximum muzzle velocities relatively long barrels
mortars simpler modern mortar originated world several patterns mortars settled stokes pattern characterized short barrel smooth bore muzzle velocity elevation angle firing generally greater simple light mounting using baseplate ground projectile integral propelling charge dropped barrel muzzle fixed firing since time mortars become rifled adopted breech loading
recognized typifying characteristics artillery characteristic type obturation used seal chamber prevent gases escaping breech metal cartridge case also holds propelling charge configuration called quickfiring nations alternative metal cartridge case propellant merely bagged combustible cases breech providing sealing called breech loading nations
second characteristic form propulsion modern equipment either towed selfpropelled towed fires ground inherent protection limited shield towing horse teams lasted throughout world armies others fully mechanized wheeled tracked towing vehicles outbreak size towing vehicle depends weight equipment amount ammunition carry
variation towed portee vehicle carries dismounted firing mortars often carried mortar sometimes carried armored vehicle either fire dismounted fire ground since early 1960s possible carry lighter towed guns mortars helicopter even parachuted landed glider time first airborne trials ussr 1930s
equipment integral part vehicle carries first appeared world really develop world mostly tracked vehicles wheeled started appear 1970s armor carry little ammunition armoured usually carry useful ammunition load early armoured mostly casemate configuration essence open armored offering limited traverse however modern armored full enclosed armored turret usually giving full traverse many cannot fire without deploying stabilizers spades sometimes hydraulic designed recoil forces transferred directly onto ground baseplate towed guns given limited selfpropulsion means auxiliary engine

artillery used variety roles depending type caliber general role artillery provide fire support—the application fire coordinated manoeuvre forces destroy neutralize suppress enemy nato definition course makes artillery supporting although nato armies agree logic italicised terms natos58
unlike rockets guns howitzers armies still call mortars suitable delivering close supporting fire however suitable providing deep supporting fire although limited range many mortars tends exclude role control arrangements limited range also mean mortars suited direct supporting fire guns used either general supporting fire rockets mostly used latter however lighter rockets used direct fire support rules thumb apply nato armies
modern mortars lighter weight simpler transportable design usually integral part infantry armies armor units means generally concentrate fire shorter range disadvantage armies also consider infantry operated mortars responsive artillery function control arrangements case armies however mortars always used artillery units remain many armies including nato
nato armies artillery usually assigned tactical mission establishes relationship responsibilities formation units assigned seems nato nations terms outside nato others probably used standard terms direct support general support general support reinforcing reinforcing tactical missions context command authority operational command operational control tactical command tactical control
nato direct support generally means directly supporting artillery unit provides observers liaison manoeuvre troops supported typically artillery battalion equivalent assigned brigade batteries brigades battalions however armies achieve placing assigned artillery units command directly supported formation nevertheless batteries fire concentrated onto single target fire units range tactical missions
application fireedit

several dimensions subject first notion fire opportunity target prearranged latter either oncall scheduled prearranged targets part fire plan fire either observed unobserved former adjusted latter predicted observation adjusted fire directly forward observer indirectly target acquisition system
nato also recognises several different types fire support tactical purposes

counterbattery fire delivered purpose destroying neutralizing enemys fire support system
counterpreparation fire intensive prearranged fire delivered imminence enemy attack discovered
covering fire used protect troops within range enemy small arms
defensive fire delivered supporting units assist protect unit engaged defensive action
final protective fire immediately available prearranged barrier fire designed impede enemy movement across defensive lines areas
harassing fire random number shells fired random intervals without pattern enemy predict process designed hinder enemy forces movement constantly imposed stress threat losses inability enemy forces relax sleep lowers morale
interdiction fire placed area point prevent enemy using area point
preparation fire delivered attack weaken enemy position

purposes existed 20th century although definitions evolved continue lack suppression counterbattery omission broadly defined either

deep supporting fire directed objectives immediate vicinity force neutralizing destroying enemy reserves weapons interfering enemy command supply communications observation
close supporting fire placed enemy troops weapons positions proximity present immediate serious threat supported unit

nato terms also need definition

neutralization fire delivered render target temporarily ineffective unusable
suppression fire degrades performance target level needed fulfill mission suppression usually effective duration fire

tactical purposes also include various mission verbs rapidly expanding subject modern concept effects based operations
targeting process selecting target matching appropriate response taking account operational requirements capabilities requires consideration type fire support required extent coordination supported involves decisions

effects required example neutralization suppression
proximity risks troops noncombatants
types munitions including fuzing used quantities
targets attacked possibly long
methods used example converged distributed whether adjustment permissible surprise essential need special procedures precision danger close
many fire units needed ones available range required munitions type quantity allotted another target suitable line fire risk troops noncombatants

targeting process aspect tactical fire control depending circumstances national procedures undertaken place distributed armies practicing control front process undertaken forward observer target acquirer particularly case smaller target requiring fire units extent process formal informal makes computer based systems documented norms experience judgement also varies widely armies circumstances
surprise essential irrelevant depends effects required whether target likely move quickly improve protective posture world researchers concluded impact fuzed munitions relative risk follows

standing
lying
firing trenches 115–150
crouching trenches 125–1100

airburst munitions significantly increase relative risk lying historically casualties occur first 10–15 seconds fire time needed react improve protective posture however less relevant airburst used
several ways making best brief window maximum vulnerability

ordering guns fire together either executive order fire time disadvantage fire concentrated many dispersed fire units different times flight first rounds spread time extent large concentration offsets problem mean round required could arrive second window
burst fire rate fire deliver three rounds within seconds reduces number guns hence fire units needed means less dispersed less variation times flight smaller caliber guns always able deliver three rounds seconds larger calibers firing fixed rounds could also wasnt 1970s multicharge howitzer fh70 first gained capability
multiple round simultaneous impact mrsi single weapon multiple individual weapons fire multiple rounds differing trajectories rounds arrive target time
time target fire units fire time less time flight works well prearranged scheduled fire less satisfactory opportunity targets means delaying delivery fire selecting safe time fire units achieve used previous methods

counterbattery fireedit
main article counterbattery fire
modern counterbattery fire developed world objective defeating enemys artillery typically fire used suppress enemy batteries interfere activities friendly forces prevent enemy defensive artillery fire impending attack systematically destroy enemy guns world latter required observation first indirect counterbattery fire 1900 observer balloon
enemy artillery detected ways either direct observation guns ground observers including specialist reconnaissance firing signatures includes radars tracking shells flight determine place origin sound ranging detecting guns firing resecting position pairs microphones crossobservation flashes using observation human observers optoelectronic devices although widespread adoption flashless propellant limited effectiveness latter
hostile batteries detected engaged immediately friendly artillery later optimum time depending tactical situation counterbattery policy strike another option situations task locate active enemy batteries attack using counterbattery fire appropriate moment accordance plan developed artillery intelligence staff situations counterbattery fire occur whenever battery located sufficient accuracy
modern counterbattery target acquisition uses unmanned aircraft counterbattery radar ground reconnaissance soundranging counterbattery fire adjusted systems example operator unmanned aircraft follow battery moves defensive measures batteries include frequently changing position constructing defensive earthworks tunnels used north korea extreme example countermeasures include defence aircraft attacking counterbattery radars physically electronically
