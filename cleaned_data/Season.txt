currently common equinox solstice dates march june september december fouryear average slowly shifts earlier times century progresses shift full years compensated mainly century leap year rules gregorian calendar 2000 leap year current shift progressing since beginning last century equinoxes solstices relatively late also means many years twentieth century dates march june september december much common older books teach older people still remember dates

seasonal changes regarding tree year


ecologically speaking season period year certain types floral animal events happen flowers bloom—spring hedgehogs hibernate—winter observe change daily floralanimal events season changing sense ecological seasons defined absolute terms unlike calendarbased methods seasons relative specific conditions associated particular ecological season dont normally occur particular region area cannot said experience season regular basis
modern midlatitude ecologicaledit
seasons distinguished fixed calendarbased dates like meteorological astronomical seasons18 oceanic regions tend experience beginning hibernal season month later continental climates conversely prevernal vernal seasons begin month earlier near oceanic coastal areas example prevernal crocus blooms typically appear early february coastal areas british columbia british isles generally dont appear march april locations like midwest parts eastern europe actual dates season vary climate region shift year next average dates listed mild cool temperate climate zones northern hemisphere

prevernal early prespring begins february mild temperate march cool temperate deciduous tree buds begin swell types migrating birds winter summer habitats
vernal spring begins march mild temperate late april cool temperate tree buds burst leaves birds establish territories begin mating nesting
estival high summer begins june temperate climates trees full leaf birds hatch raise offspring
serotinal late summer generally begins late august deciduous leaves begin change color higher latitude locations north young birds reach maturity join adult birds preparing autumn migration traditional harvest season begins early september
autumnal autumn generally begins late september tree leaves full color turn brown fall ground birds migrate back wintering areas
hibernal winter begins december mild temperate november cool temperate deciduous trees bare fallen leaves begin decay migrating birds settled winter habitats

tropical ecologicaledit
tropics seasonal dates also vary common speak rainy monsoon season versus season example nicaragua season november april called summer rainy season october called winter even though located northern hemisphere tropical areas threeway division rainy cool season used noticeable change amount sunlight different times year however many regions northern indian ocean subject monsoon rain wind cycles
floral animal activity variation near equator depends wetdry cycles seasonal temperature variations different species flowering emerging cocoons specific times monsoon season thus tropics characterized numerous miniseasons within larger seasonal blocks time
tropical parts australia northern parts queensland western australia northern territory seasons observed addition place temperate season names19
indigenous ecologicaledit
also indigenous australian seasons
indigenous people polar temperate tropical climates northern eurasia americas africa oceania australia traditionally defined seasons ecologically observing activity plants animals weather around separate tribal group traditionally observes different seasons determined according local criteria vary hibernation polar bears arctic tundras growing seasons plants tropical rainforests australia tribes eight seasons year10 sami people scandinavia many indigenous people longer live directly land traditional often nomadic styles observe modern methods seasonal reckoning according customary particular country region
official designationsedit
noted variety dates used different countries mark changes seasons especially calendar based observances often declared official within respective jurisdictions local national media even weather climate contradictory20 however mainly matter custom generally proclaimed governments north south equator civil purposes2122
