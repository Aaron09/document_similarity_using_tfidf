monetary policy process monetary authority country like central bank currency board controls supply money often targeting inflation rate interest rate ensure price stability general trust currency123
goals monetary policy usually contribute economic growth stability lower unemployment maintain predictable exchange rates currencies
monetary economics provides insight craft optimal monetary policy since 1970s monetary policy generally formed separately fiscal policy refers taxation government spending associated borrowing4
monetary policy referred either expansionary contractionary expansionary policy monetary authority uses tools stimulate economy expansionary policy increases total supply money economy rapidly usual traditionally used combat unemployment recession lowering interest rates hope easy credit entice businesses expanding also increases aggregate demand overall demand goods services economy boosts growth measured gross domestic product expansionary monetary policy usually diminishes value currency thereby decreasing exchange rate5
opposite expansionary monetary policy contractionary monetary policy slows rate growth money supply even shrinks slows economic growth prevent inflation contractionary monetary policy lead increased unemployment depressed borrowing spending consumers businesses eventually result economic recession hence well managed conducted care6

central bank influences interest rates expanding contracting monetary base consists currency circulation banks reserves deposit central bank central banks three main tools monetary policy open market operations discount rate reserve requirements
commonly usedis truecitation needed tool central bank affect monetary base open market operations entails managing quantity money circulation buying selling various financial instruments treasury bills company bonds foreign currencies exchange money deposit central bank deposits convertible currency purchases sales result less base currency entering leaving market circulation example central bank wishes lower interest rates executing expansionary monetary policy purchases government debt thereby increasing amount cash circulation crediting banks reserve accounts commercial banks money lend reduce lending rates making loans less expensive cheaper credit card interest rates boost consumer spending additionally business loans affordable companies expand keep consumer demand ultimately hire workers whose incomes rise turn also increases demand tool usually enough stimulate demand drive economic growth healthy rate usually shortterm goal open market operations achieve specific shortterm interest rate target instances monetary policy might instead entail targeting specific exchange rate relative foreign currency else relative gold example case federal reserve targets federal funds rate rate member banks lend another overnight however monetary policy china target exchange rate chinese renminbi basket foreign currencies
open market operations lead desired effects second tool used central bank increase decrease interest rate charges discounts overdrafts loans central bank commercial banks discount window interest rate transactions sufficiently commercial banks borrow central bank meet reserve requirements additional liquidity expand balance sheets increasing credit available economy
third alternative change reserve requirements reserve requirement refers proportion total assets banks must keep hand overnight either vaults central bank banks maintain small portion assets cash available immediate withdrawal rest invested illiquid assets like mortgages loans lowering reserve requirement frees funds banks increase loans profitable assets expansionary creates credit however even though tool immediately increases liquidity central banks rarely change reserve requirement expensive requires policies procedures disrupting member banks open market operations therefore preferred
unconventional monetary policy zero boundedit
forms monetary policy particularly used interest rates near concerns deflation deflation occurring referred unconventional monetary policy include credit easing quantitative easing forward guidance signaling16 credit easing central bank purchases private sector assets improve liquidity improve access credit signaling used lower market expectations lower interest rates future example credit crisis 2008 federal reserve indicated rates would extended period bank canada made conditional commitment keep rates lower bound basis points second quarter 2010
heterodox monetary policy proposals include idea helicopter money whereby central banks would create money without assets counterpart balance sheet money created could distributed directly population citizens dividend option increasingly discussed since march 2016 ecbs president mario draghi said found concept interesting17

economics expansionary fiscal policy includes higher spending cuts encourage economic growth19 turn expansionary monetary policy seeks increase size money supply usual inciting money supply aimed lowering interest rates purpose achieve economic growth increase economic activity20 conversely contractionary monetary policy seeks reduce size money supply nations monetary policy controlled either central bank finance ministry neoclassical keynesian economics significantly differ effects effectiveness monetary policy influencing real economy clear consensus monetary policy affects real economic variables aggregate output income employment economic schools accept monetary policy affects monetary variables price levels interest rates
inflation targetingedit
main article inflation targeting
also monetary policy reaction function
policy approach target keep inflation particular definition consumer price index within desired range
inflation target achieved periodic adjustments central bank interest rate target interest rate used generally overnight rate banks lend overnight cash flow purposes depending country particular interest rate might called cash rate something similar
fisher effect model explains equation linking inflation interest rates foreign abroad following



inflation home home interest rate central bank world real interest rate using anchor central banks influence central banks choose maintain fixed interest rates times keep constant interest rate real world interest rate changes duration policy varies simplicity associated changing nominal interest rate
interest rate target maintained specific duration using open market operations typically duration interest rate target kept constant vary months years interest rate target usually reviewed monthly quarterly basis policy committee18
changes interest rate target made response various market indicators attempt forecast economic trends keep market track towards achieving defined inflation target example simple method inflation targeting called taylor rule adjusts interest rate response changes inflation rate output rule proposed john taylor stanford university21
inflation targeting approach monetary policy approach pioneered zealand used australia brazil canada chile colombia czech republic hungary zealand norway iceland india philippines poland sweden south africa turkey united kingdom
price level targetingedit
price level targeting monetary policy similar inflation targeting except growth year long term price level target offset subsequent years targeted pricelevel reached time five years giving certainty future price increases consumers inflation targeting happened immediate past years taken account adjusted current future years
uncertainty price levels create uncertainty around price wage setting activity firms workers undermines information gained relative prices difficult firms determine change price good service inflation factors increase efficiency factors production inflation high volatile increase inflation also leads decrease demand money reduces incentive hold money increases transaction costs shoe leather costs
monetary aggregatesmoney supply targetingedit
1980s several countries used approach based constant growth money supply approach refined include different classes money credit approach monetary policy discontinued selection alan greenspan chairman
approach also sometimes called monetarism
central banks might choose money supply growth target nominal anchor keep prices stable long term quantity theory long model links price levels money supply demand using equation rearrange following



inflation money supply growth rate real output growth equation suggests controlling money supplyâ€™s growth rate ultimately lead price stability long nominal anchor central bank would need equal constant commit maintaining target
however money supply growth rate considered weak policy target real output growth result higher output growth rate result level inflation output growth rate result inflation would higher desired level18
monetary policy typically focuses price signal form another approach focused monetary quantities quantities could role economy business cycles depending households risk aversion level money sometimes explicitly added central banks reaction function22 recently however central banks shifting away policies focus money supply targeting uncertainty real output growth introduces central banks like choosing combine money supply anchor targets
nominal incomengdp targetingedit
main article nominal income target
related money targeting nominal income targeting also called nominal ngdp targeting originally proposed james meade 1978 james tobin 1980 advocated scott sumner reinforced market monetarist school thought
central banks implement monetary policy explicitly however numerous studies shown monetary policy targeting better matches welfare optimizing monetary policy compared standard monetary policy targeting23
fixed exchange rate targetingedit
policy based maintaining fixed exchange rate foreign currency varying degrees fixed exchange rates ranked relation rigid fixed exchange rate anchor nation
system fiat fixed rates local government monetary authority declares fixed exchange rate actively sell currency maintain rate instead rate enforced nonconvertibility measures capital controls importexport licenses case black market exchange rate currency trades marketunofficial rate
system fixedconvertibility currency bought sold central bank monetary authority daily basis achieve target exchange rate target rate fixed level fixed band within exchange rate fluctuate monetary authority intervenes sell necessary maintain exchange rate within band case fixed exchange rate fixed level seen special case fixed exchange rate bands bands zero
system fixed exchange rates maintained currency board every unit local currency must backed unit foreign currency correcting exchange rate ensures local monetary base inflate without backed hard currency eliminates worries local currency wishing convert local currency hard anchor currency
dollarization foreign currency usually dollar hence term dollarization used freely medium exchange either exclusively parallel local currency outcome come local population lost faith local currency also policy government usually rein inflation import credible monetary policy
theoretically using relative rate depreciation must equal inflation differential



implies

subscript denotes home country indicates foreign country anchor variable rate depreciation therefore rate inflation home must equal rate inflation foreign country plus rate depreciation exchange rate homeâ€™s currency relative
strict fixed exchange rate rate depreciation exchange rate equal zero currency unions case crawling rate equal constant limited flexible band rate depreciation allowed fluctuate within given range
fixing rate depreciation theory concludes home countryâ€™s inflation rate must depend foreign country example percent increase inflation home raises foreign countryâ€™s inflation percent countries decide fixed exchange rate monetary regime order take advantage price stability control inflation practice half nationâ€™s monetary regimes fixed exchange rate anchoring18
policies often abdicate monetary policy foreign monetary authority government monetary policy pegging nation must align monetary policy anchor nation maintain exchange rate degree local monetary policy becomes dependent anchor nation depends factors capital mobility openness credit channels economic factors

following collapse bretton woods nominal anchoring grown importance monetary policy makers inflation reduction particularly governments sought anchoring order curtail rapid high inflation 1970s 1980s 1990s countries began explicitly credible nominal anchors addition many countries chose target well implicit targets result global inflation rates average decreased gradually since 1970s central banks gained credibility increasing independence
global financial crisis 2008 sparked controversy flexibility inflation nominal anchoring many economists argue inflation targets currently many monetary regimes crisis many inflation anchoring countries reached lower bound zero rates resulting inflation rates decreasing almost zero even deflation18
implicationsedit
anchors discussed article suggest keeping inflation desired level feasible setting target interest rate money supply growth rate price level rate depreciation however anchors valid central bank commits maintaining turn requires central bank abandons monetary policy autonomy long central bank anchors maintain target inflation rate would forfeit using policies note important mention using anchors prove complicated certain exchange rate regimes freely floating managed floating regimes options affect inflation enjoy flexibility pegged currency country without currency latter regimes would implement exchange rate target influence inflation none instruments available
credibilityedit
shortterm effects monetary policy influenced degree announcements policy deemed credible24 particular antiinflation policy announced central bank absence credibility eyes public inflationary expectations drop shortrun effect announcement subsequent sustained antiinflation policy likely combination somewhat lower inflation higher unemployment phillips curvenairu rational expectations policy announcement deemed credible inflationary expectations drop commensurately announced policy intent inflation likely come quickly without much cost terms unemployment
thus advantage central bank independent political authority shield prospect political pressure reverse direction policy even seemingly independent central bank central bank whose hands tied antiinflation policy might deemed fully credible case advantage central bank bound follow policy pronouncements lending credibility
