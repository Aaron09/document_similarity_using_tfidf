numerous criticisms made regarding impact factors111213 thing impact factor might consistently reproduced independent audit14 also general debate validity impact factor measure journal importance effect policies editors adopt boost impact factor perhaps detriment readers writers criticism focuses effect impact factor behavior scholars editors stakeholders1516 others made general criticisms arguing emphasis impact factor results negative influence neoliberal policies academia claiming needed replacement impact factor sophisticated metrics science publications also discussion social value research assessment growing precariousness scientific careers higher education171819
validity measure importanceedit
stated impact factors citation analysis general affected fielddependent factors20 invalidate comparisons across disciplines even within different fields research discipline21 percentage total citations occurring first years publication also varies highly among disciplines mathematical physical sciences biological sciences22 thus impact factors cannot used compare journals across disciplines
citation counts highly skewed distributions23 mean number citations potentially misleading used gauge typical impact articles journal rather overall impact journal itself24 example natures 2004 impact factor based quarter publications thus actual number citations single article journal cases much lower mean number citations across articles25 furthermore strength relationship impact factors journals citation rates papers therein steadily decreasing since articles began available digitally26
indeed impact factors sometimes used evaluate journals papers therein thereby devaluing papers certain subjects27 higher education funding council england urged house commons science technology select committee remind research assessment exercise panels obliged assess quality content individual articles reputation journal published28 effect outliers seen case article short history shelx included sentence paper could serve general literature citation opensource shelx programs bruker version shelxtl employed course crystalstructure determination article received 6600 citations consequence impact factor journal acta crystallographica section rose 2051 2008 49926 2009 nature 31434 science 2810329 secondmost cited article acta crystallographica section 2008 citations30 also important note impact factor journal metric used assess individual researchers institutions3132
journal rankings constructed based solely impact factors moderately correlate compiled results expert surveys33
cawkell sometime director research institute scientific information remarked science citation index impact factor based ″would work perfectly every author meticulously cited earlier work related theme covered every scientific journal published anywhere world free economic constraints″34
editorial policies affect impact factoredit
journal adopt editorial policies increase impact factor3536 example journals publish larger percentage review articles generally cited research reports37 thus review articles raise impact factor journal review journals therefore often highest impact factors respective fields16 journal editors submissions policy invitation invite exclusively senior scientists publish citable papers increase journal impact factor16
journals also attempt limit number citable items—ie denominator impact factor equation—either declining publish articles unlikely cited case reports medical journals altering articles allowing abstract bibliography hopes journal citation reports deem citable item result negotiations whether items citable impact factor variations observed38 items considered uncitable—and thus incorporated impact factor calculations—can cited still enter numerator part equation despite ease citations could excluded effect hard evaluate distinction editorial comment short original articles always obvious example letters editor refer either class
another less insidious tactic journals employ publish large portion papers least papers expected highly cited early calendar year gives papers time gather citations several methods necessarily nefarious intent exist journal cite articles journal increase journals impact factor3940
beyond editorial policies skew impact factor journals take overt steps game system example 2007 specialist journal folia phoniatrica logopaedica impact factor published editorial cited articles 2005 2006 protest absurd scientific situation countries related impact factor41 large number citations meant impact factor journal increased result increase journal included 2008 2009 journal citation reports42
coercive citation practice editor forces author extraneous citations article journal agree publish order inflate journals impact factor survey published 2012 indicates coercive citation experienced five researchers working economics sociology psychology multiple business disciplines common business journals lower impact factor43 however cases coercive citation occasionally reported scientific disciplines44
