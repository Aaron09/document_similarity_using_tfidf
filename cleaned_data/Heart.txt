animal hearts widely consumed food almost entirely muscle high protein often included dishes offal example panottoman kokoretsi
chicken hearts considered giblets often grilled skewers japanese hāto yakitori brazilian churrasco coração indonesian chicken heart satay108 also panfried jerusalem mixed grill egyptian cuisine used finely chopped part stuffing chicken109 many recipes combined giblets mexican pollo menudencias110 russian ragu kurinyikh potrokhov111

beef heart grilled braised114 peruvian anticuchos corazón barbecued beef hearts grilled tenderized long marination spice vinegar mixture australian recipe mock goose actually braised stuffed beef heart115
heart stewed poached braised116 made sausage balinese oret sort blood sausage made heart blood french recipe cœur porc lorange made braised heart orange sauce
animals
also circulatory system
vertebrates
size heart varies among different animal groups hearts vertebrates ranging smallest mice blue whale kg117 vertebrates heart lies middle ventral part body surrounded pericardium118 fish connected peritoneum119
node found amniotes primitive vertebrates animals muscles heart relatively continuous sinus venosus coordinates beat passes wave remaining chambers indeed since sinus venosus incorporated right atrium amniotes likely homologous node teleosts vestigial sinus venosus main centre coordination instead atrium rate heartbeat varies enormously different species ranging around beats minute codfish around hummingbirds120 1200 rubythroated hummingbird121
double circulatory systems




cross section three chambered adult amphibian heart note single ventricle purple regions represent areas mixing oxygenated deoxygenated blood occurs


pulmonary vein
left atrium
right atrium
ventricle
conus arteriosus
sinus venosus





adult amphibians reptiles double circulatory system meaning circulatory system divided arterial venous parts however heart completely separated sides instead separated three chambers atria ventricle blood returning systemic circulation lungs returned blood pumped simultaneously systemic circulation lungs double system allows blood circulate lungs deliver oxygenated blood directly heart122
reptiles heart usually situated around middle thorax snakes usually junction upper first second third heart three chambers atria ventricle ventricle incompletely separated halves wall septum considerable near pulmonary artery aortic openings reptilian species appears little mixing bloodstreams aorta receives essentially oxygenated blood120122 exception rule crocodiles fourchambered heart123
heart lungfish septum extends partway ventricle allows degree separation deoxygenated bloodstream destined lungs oxygenated stream delivered rest body absence division living amphibian species partly amount respiration occurs skin thus blood returned heart venae cavae already partially oxygenated result less need finer division bloodstreams lungfish tetrapods nonetheless least species amphibian spongy nature ventricle seem maintain separation bloodstreams also original valves conus arteriosus replaced spiral valve divides parallel parts thereby helping keep bloodstreams separate120
fully divided heart
archosaurs crocodilians birds mammals show complete separation heart pumps total four heart chambers thought fourchambered heart archosaurs evolved independently mammals crocodilians small opening foramen panizza base arterial trunks degree mixing blood side heart dive underwater124125 thus birds mammals streams blood pulmonary systemic circulations permanently kept entirely separate physical barrier120
fish
main article fish anatomy heart




blood flow fish heart sinus venosus atrium ventricle outflow tract



fish often described twochambered heart126 consisting atrium receive blood ventricle pump it127 however fish heart entry exit compartments called chambers also sometimes described threechambered127 fourchambered128 depending counted chamber atrium ventricle sometimes considered true chambers others considered accessory chambers129
primitive fish fourchambered heart chambers arranged sequentially primitive heart quite unlike fourchambered hearts mammals birds first chamber sinus venosus collects deoxygenated blood body hepatic cardinal veins blood flows atrium powerful muscular ventricle main pumping action take place fourth final chamber conus arteriosus contains several valves sends blood ventral aorta ventral aorta delivers blood gills oxygenated flows dorsal aorta rest body tetrapods ventral aorta divided half forms ascending aorta forms pulmonary artery120
adult fish four chambers arranged straight instead form sshape latter chambers lying former relatively simpler pattern found cartilaginous fish rayfinned fish teleosts conus arteriosus small accurately described part aorta rather heart proper conus arteriosus present amniotes presumably absorbed ventricles course evolution similarly sinus venosus present vestigial structure reptiles birds otherwise absorbed right atrium longer distinguishable120
invertebrates




tubelike heart green mosquito anopheles gambiae extends horizontally across body interlinked diamondshaped wing muscles also green surrounded pericardial cells blue depicts cell nuclei






basic arthropod body structure heart shown


arthropods mollusks open circulatory system system deoxygenated blood collects around heart cavities sinuses blood slowly permeates heart many small oneway channels heart pumps blood hemocoel cavity organs heart arthropods typically muscular tube runs length body back base head instead blood circulatory fluid haemolymph carries commonly used respiratory pigment copperbased haemocyanin oxygen transporter ironbased haemoglobin used arthropods130
invertebrates earthworms circulatory system used transport oxygen much reduced veins arteries consisting connected tubes oxygen travels diffusion five small muscular vessels connect vessels contract front animals thought hearts130
squids cephalopods gill hearts also known branchial hearts systemic heart brachial hearts atria ventricle pump gills whereas systemic heart pumps body131132
