first version modern controlledaccess highways evolved first half 20th century long island motor parkway long island york opened 1908 private venture worlds first limitedaccess roadway included many modern features including banked turns guard rails reinforced concrete tarmac9
modern controlledaccess highways originated early 1920s response rapidly increasing automobile demand faster movement cities consequence improvements paving processes techniques materials original highspeed roads referred dual highways divided bore little resemblance highways today opened 1921 avus berlin oldest controlledaccess highway europe although initially opened race track

major arterial roads often partial access control meaning side roads intersect main road grade instead using interchanges driveways connect directly main road drivers must intersecting roads access adjacent land arterial junctions relatively quiet side roads traffic controlled mainly twoway stop signs impose significant interruptions traffic using main highway roundabouts often used busier intersections europe help minimize interruptions flow traffic signals create greater interference traffic still preferred north america occasional interchanges major arterial roads examples include eastern terminus delaware ohio along eastern terminus 29us western central ohio type road sometimes called expressway
construction techniquesedit
frequent freeways laid usually building ground things forestry buildings cleared away sometimes deplete farmland methods developed economic social even environmental reasons
full freeways sometimes made converting atgrade expressways replacing atgrade intersections overpasses however atgrade intersection ends freeway remainscitation needed often twolane undivided freeway expressway converted constructing twin corridor side leaving median travel directions opposing side twoway corridor becomes passing lane
techniques involve building carriageway side divided highway private access side sometimes long driveways side since easement widening comes place especially rural areas
third carriageway added sometimes shift directional carriageway 50–200 feet 15–61 maybe depending land availability retain private access side favors methods involve constructing service drive shortens long driveways typically less metres
