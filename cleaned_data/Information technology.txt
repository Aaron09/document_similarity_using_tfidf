main article history computing hardware
devices used computation thousands years probably initially form tally stick8 antikythera mechanism dating beginning first century generally considered earliest known mechanical analog computer earliest known geared mechanism9279 comparable geared devices emerge europe 16th century1094 1645 first mechanical calculator capable performing four basic arithmetical operations developed113
electronic computers using either relays valves began appear early 1940s electromechanical zuse completed 1941 worlds first programmable computer modern standards first machines could considered complete computing machine colossus developed second world decrypt german messages first electronic digital computer although programmable generalpurpose designed perform single task also lacked ability store program memory programming carried using plugs switches alter internal wiring12page needed first recognisably modern electronic digital storedprogram computer manchester smallscale experimental machine ssem first program june 194813
development transistors late 1940s bell laboratories allowed generation computers designed greatly reduced power consumption first commercially available storedprogram computer ferranti mark contained 4050 valves power consumption kilowatts comparison first transistorised computer developed university manchester operational november 1953 consumed watts final version14

database management systems emerged 1960s252 address problem storing retrieving large amounts data accurately quickly earliest systems ibms information management system ims252 still widely deployed years later26 stores data hierarchically252 1970s codd proposed alternative relational storage model based theory predicate logic familiar concepts tables rows columns first commercially available relational database management system rdbms available oracle 1980253
database management systems consist number components together allow data store accessed simultaneously many users maintaining integritycitation needed characteristic databases structure data contain defined stored separately data database schema252
extensible markup language become popular format data representation recent years although data stored normal file systems commonly held relational databases take advantage robust implementation verified years theoretical practical effort272 evolution standard generalized markup language sgml xmls textbased structure offers advantage machine humanreadable274
data retrievaledit
relational database model introduced programminglanguage independent structured query language based relational algebra
terms data information synonymous anything stored data becomes information organized presented meaningfully281–9 worlds digital data unstructured stored variety different physical formats292b even within single organization data warehouses began developed 1980s integrate disparate stores typically contain data extracted various sources including external sources internet organized facilitate decision support systems dss304–6
data transmissionedit
data transmission three aspects transmission propagation reception31361 broadly categorized broadcasting information transmitted unidirectionally downstream telecommunications bidirectional upstream downstream channels23
increasingly employed means data interchange since early 2000s27xiii particularly machineoriented interactions involved weboriented protocols soap274 describing dataintransit rather dataatrest27xiii challenges usage converting data relational databases document object model structures32228–31
