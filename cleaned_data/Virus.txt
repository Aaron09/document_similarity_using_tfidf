origins
also viral evolution
viruses found wherever life probably existed since living cells first evolved43 origin viruses unclear form fossils molecular techniques used compare viruses useful means investigating arose44 addition viral genetic material occasionally integrate germline host organisms passed vertically offspring host many generations provides invaluable source information paleovirologists trace back ancient viruses existed millions years three main hypotheses explain origins viruses4546

regressive hypothesis
viruses small cells parasitised larger cells time genes required parasitism lost bacteria rickettsia chlamydia living cells like viruses reproduce inside host cells lend support hypothesis dependence parasitism likely caused loss genes enabled survive outside cell also called degeneracy hypothesis4748 reduction hypothesis49
cellular origin hypothesis
viruses evolved bits escaped genes larger organism escaped could come plasmids pieces naked move cells transposons molecules replicate move around different positions within genes cell50 called jumping genes transposons examples mobile genetic elements could origin viruses discovered maize barbara mcclintock 195051 sometimes called vagrancy hypothesis4752 escape hypothesis49

virotherapy involves genetically modified viruses treat diseases242 viruses modified scientists reproduce cancer cells destroy infect healthy cells talimogene laherparepvec tvec example modified herpes simplex virus gene required viruses replicate healthy cells deleted replaced human gene gmcsf stimulates immunity virus infects cancer cells destroys presence gmcsf gene attracts dendritic cells surrounding tissues body dendritic cells process dead cancer cells present components cells immune system243 completed successful clinical trials virus expected gain approval treatment skin cancer called melanoma late 2015244 viruses reprogrammed kill cancer cells called oncolytic viruses245
materials science nanotechnology
current trends nanotechnology promise make much versatile viruses viewpoint materials scientist viruses regarded organic nanoparticles surface carries specific tools designed cross barriers host cells size shape viruses number nature functional groups surface precisely defined viruses commonly used materials science scaffolds covalently linked surface modifications particular quality viruses tailored directed evolution powerful techniques developed life sciences becoming basis engineering approaches towards nanomaterials opening wide range applications beyond biology medicine246
size shape welldefined chemical structures viruses used templates organising materials nanoscale recent examples include work naval research laboratory washington using cowpea mosaic virus cpmv particles amplify signals microarray based sensors application virus particles separate fluorescent dyes used signalling prevent formation nonfluorescent dimers quenchers247 another example cpmv nanoscale breadboard molecular electronics248
synthetic viruses
many viruses synthesised novo scratch first synthetic virus created 2002249 although somewhat misconception actual virus synthesised rather genome case virus cdna copy genome case viruses many virus families naked synthetic enzymatically converted back synthetic cdna infectious introduced cell contain necessary information produce viruses technology used investigate novel vaccine strategies250 ability synthesise viruses farreaching consequences since viruses longer regarded extinct long information genome sequence known permissive cells available november 2017update fulllength genome sequences 7454 different viruses including smallpox publicly available online database maintained national institutes health251
weapons
details topic biological warfare
ability viruses cause devastating epidemics human societies concern viruses could weaponised biological warfare concern raised successful recreation infamous 1918 influenza virus laboratory252 smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history eradication centres world authorised keep stocks smallpox virus state research center virology biotechnology vector russia centers disease control prevention united states253 fears used weapon totally unfounded253 vaccine smallpox sometimes severe sideeffects longer used routinely country thus much modern human population almost established resistance smallpox would vulnerable virus253
