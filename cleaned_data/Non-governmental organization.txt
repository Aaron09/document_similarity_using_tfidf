james pfeiffer case study involvement mozambique speaks negative effects ngos areas health within country argues last decade ngos mozambique fragmented local health system undermined local control health programs contributed growing local social inequality68

jessica mathews wrote foreign affairs 1997 strengths ngos special interests best often suffer tunnel vision judging every public affects particular interest70 since ngos worry policy tradeoffs overall impact cause might bring harm society71
vijay prashad argues 1970s world bank robert mcnamara championed alternative state leaving intact global regional relations power production72

origin funding serious implications legitimacy ngos recent decades ngos increased numbers range activities level become increasingly dependent limited number donors91 consequently competition increased funding expectations donors themselves92 runs risk donors adding conditions threaten independence ngos example overdependence official potential dilute “the willingness ngos speak issues unpopular governments”89 situations ngos held accountable donors erode rather enhance legitimacy difficult challenge overcome commentators also argued changes funding sources ultimately altered functions899394
ngos also challenged grounds necessarily represent needs developing world diminishing socalled “southern voice” postulate north–south divide exists arena ngos95 question equality relationships northern southern parts ngos well relationships southern northern ngos working partnerships suggests division labour develop north taking lead advocacy resource mobilisation whilst south engages service delivery developing world95 potential implications mean needs developing world addressed appropriately northern ngos properly consult participate partnerships real danger situation western views take front seat assign unrepresentative priorities96
flood ngos also accused damaging public sector multiple developing countries accusations mismanagement resulted breakdown public health care systems instead promoting equity alleviating poverty ngos scrutiny contributing socioeconomic inequality disempowering services public sector third world countries6897
scale variety activities ngos participate grown rapidly since 1980s witnessing particular expansion 1990s98 presented ngos need balance pressures centralisation decentralisation centralising ngos particularly operate international level assign common theme goals conversely also advantageous decentralise increase chances responding flexibly effectively localised issues implementing projects modest scale easily monitored produce immediate benefits involved know corruption punished9799
