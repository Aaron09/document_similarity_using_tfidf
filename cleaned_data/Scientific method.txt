process
overall process involves making conjectures hypotheses deriving predictions logical consequences carrying experiments based predictions determine whether original conjecture correct7 difficulties formulaic statement method however though scientific method often presented fixed sequence steps actions better considered general principles12 steps take place every scientific inquiry degree always done order noted scientist philosopher william whewell 1794–1866 invention sagacity genius13 required every step
formulation question
question refer explanation specific observation blue also openended design drug cure particular disease stage frequently involves finding evaluating evidence previous experiments personal scientific observations assertions well work scientists answer already known different question builds evidence posed applying scientific method research determining good question difficult affect outcome investigation31
hypothesis
hypothesis conjecture based knowledge obtained formulating question explain given behavior hypothesis might specific example einsteins equivalence principle francis cricks makes makes protein32 might broad example unknown species life dwell unexplored depths oceans statistical hypothesis conjecture given statistical population example population might people particular disease conjecture might drug cure disease people terms commonly associated statistical hypotheses null hypothesis alternative hypothesis null hypothesis conjecture statistical hypothesis false example drug nothing cure caused chance researchers normally want show null hypothesis false alternative hypothesis desired outcome drug better chance final point scientific hypothesis must falsifiable meaning identify possible outcome experiment conflicts predictions deduced hypothesis otherwise cannot meaningfully tested
prediction
step involves determining logical consequences hypothesis predictions selected testing unlikely prediction would correct simply coincidence convincing would prediction fulfilled evidence also stronger answer prediction already known effects hindsight bias also postdiction ideally prediction must also distinguish hypothesis likely alternatives hypotheses make prediction observing prediction correct evidence either statements relative strength evidence mathematically derived using bayes theorem33
testing
investigation whether real world behaves predicted hypothesis scientists people test hypotheses conducting experiments purpose experiment determine whether observations real world agree conflict predictions derived hypothesis agree confidence hypothesis increases otherwise decreases agreement assure hypothesis true future experiments reveal problems karl popper advised scientists falsify hypotheses search test experiments seem doubtful large numbers successful confirmations convincing arise experiments avoid risk10 experiments designed minimize possible errors especially appropriate scientific controls example tests medical treatments commonly doubleblind tests test personnel might unwittingly reveal test subjects samples desired test drugs placebos kept ignorant hints bias responses test subjects furthermore failure experiment necessarily mean hypothesis false experiments always depend several hypotheses test equipment working properly failure failure auxiliary hypotheses duhem–quine thesis experiments conducted college kitchen table cerns large hadron collider bottom ocean mars using working rovers astronomers experiments searching planets around distant stars finally individual experiments address highly specific topics reasons practicality result evidence broader topics usually accumulated gradually
analysis
involves determining results experiment show deciding next actions take predictions hypothesis compared null hypothesis determine better able explain data cases experiment repeated many times statistical analysis chisquared test required evidence falsified hypothesis hypothesis required experiment supports hypothesis evidence strong enough high confidence predictions hypothesis must tested hypothesis strongly supported evidence question asked provide insight topic evidence scientists experience frequently incorporated stage process depending complexity experiment many iterations required gather sufficient evidence answer question confidence build many answers highly specific questions order answer single broader question
example



basic elements scientific method illustrated following example discovery structure

question previous investigation determined chemical composition four nucleotides structure individual nucleotide properties identified carrier genetic information avery–macleod–mccarty experiment 194434 mechanism genetic information stored unclear
hypothesis linus pauling francis crick james watson hypothesized helical structure35
prediction helical structure xray diffraction pattern would xshaped3637 prediction determined using mathematics helix transform derived cochran crick vand38 independently stokes prediction mathematical construct completely independent biological problem hand

analysis watson detailed diffraction pattern immediately recognized helix3940 crick produced model using information along previously known information dnas composition molecular interactions hydrogen bonds41




discovery became starting point many studies involving genetic material field molecular genetics awarded nobel prize 1962 step example examined detail later article
components
scientific method also includes components required even iterations steps completed42
replication
experiment cannot repeated produce results implies original results might error result common single experiment performed multiple times especially uncontrolled variables indications experimental error significant surprising results scientists also attempt replicate results especially results would important work43
external review
process peer review involves evaluation experiment experts typically give opinions anonymously journals request experimenter provide lists possible peer reviewers especially field highly specialized peer review certify correctness results opinion reviewer experiments sound based description supplied experimenter work passes peer review occasionally require experiments requested reviewers published peerreviewed scientific journal specific journal publishes results indicates perceived quality work44
data recording sharing
scientists typically careful recording data requirement promoted ludwik fleck 1896–1961 others45 though typically required might requested supply data scientists wish replicate original results parts original results extending sharing experimental samples difficult obtain46
scientific inquiry
scientific inquiry generally aims obtain knowledge form testable explanations scientists predict results future experiments allows scientists gain better understanding topic study later understanding intervene causal mechanisms cure disease better explanation making predictions useful frequently likely continue explain body evidence better alternatives successful explanations explain make accurate predictions wide range circumstances often called scientific theories
experimental results produce large changes human understanding improvements theoretical scientific understanding typically result gradual process development time sometimes across different domains science47 scientific models vary extent experimentally tested long acceptance scientific community general explanations become accepted time evidence accumulates given topic explanation question proves powerful alternatives explaining evidence often subsequent researchers reformulate explanations time combined explanations produce explanations
sees scientific method terms evolutionary algorithm applied science technology48
properties scientific inquiry
scientific knowledge closely tied empirical findings remain subject falsification experimental observation incompatible found theory ever considered final since problematic evidence might discovered evidence found theory proposed commonly found modifications previous theory sufficient explain evidence strength theory arguedby relate long persisted without major alteration core principles
theories also become subsumed theories example newtons laws explained thousands years scientific observations planets almost perfectly however laws determined special cases general theory relativity explained previously unexplained exceptions newtons laws predicted explained observations deflection light gravity thus certain cases independent unconnected scientific observations connected unified principles increasing explanatory power4950
since theories might comprehensive preceded thus able explain previous ones successor theories might able meet higher standard explaining larger body observations predecessors49 example theory evolution explains diversity life earth species adapt environments many patterns observed natural world5152 recent major modification unification genetics form modern evolutionary synthesis subsequent modifications also subsumed aspects many fields biochemistry molecular biology
beliefs biases

muybridges photographs horse motion 1878 used answer question whether four feet galloping horse ever ground time demonstrates photography experimental tool science


scientific methodology often directs hypotheses tested controlled conditions wherever possible frequently possible certain areas biological sciences difficult areas astronomy
practice experimental control reproducibility effect diminishing potentially harmful effects circumstance degree personal bias example preexisting beliefs alter interpretation results confirmation bias heuristic leads person particular belief things reinforcing belief even another observer might disagree words people tend observe expect observe
historical example belief legs galloping horse splayed point none horses legs touches ground point image included paintings supporters however first stopaction pictures horses gallop eadweard muybridge showed false legs instead gathered together53
another important human bias plays role preference surprising statements appeal novelty result search evidence true2 poorly attested beliefs believed acted upon less rigorous heuristic54

measurements scientific work also usually accompanied estimates uncertainty uncertainty often estimated making repeated measurements desired quantity uncertainties also calculated consideration uncertainties individual underlying quantities used counts things number people nation particular time also uncertainty data collection limitations counts represent sample desired quantities uncertainty depends upon sampling method used number samples taken
definition
measurements demand operational definitions relevant quantities scientific quantity described defined measured opposed vague inexact idealized definition example electric current measured amperes operationally defined terms mass silver deposited certain time electrode electrochemical device described detail operational definition thing often relies comparisons standards operational definition mass ultimately relies artifact particular kilogram platinumiridium kept laboratory france
