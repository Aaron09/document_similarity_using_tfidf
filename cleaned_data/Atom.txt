history atomic theory
main article atomic theory
atoms philosophy
main article atomism
idea matter made discrete units idea appearing many ancient cultures greece india word atom coined ancient greek philosophers leucippus pupil democritus12 however ideas founded philosophical theological reasoning rather evidence experimentation result views atoms look like behave incorrect also could convince everybody atomism number competing theories nature matter 19th century idea embraced refined scientists blossoming science chemistry produced discoveries concept atoms could explain
first evidencebased theory




various atoms molecules depicted john daltons system chemical philosophy 1808


early 1800s john dalton used concept atoms explain elements always react ratios small whole numbers multiple proportions instance types oxide oxygen oxygen tinii oxide dioxide respectively means 100g combine either 135g oxygen form ratio ratio small whole numbers common pattern chemistry suggested dalton elements react whole number multiples discrete units—in words atoms case oxides atom combine either oxygen atoms3
dalton also believed atomic theory could explain water absorbs different gases different proportions example found water absorbs carbon dioxide better absorbs nitrogen4 dalton hypothesized differences masses configurations gases respective particles carbon dioxide molecules heavier larger nitrogen molecules
brownian motion
1827 botanist robert brown used microscope look dust grains floating water discovered moved erratically phenomenon became known brownian motion thought caused water molecules knocking grains 1905 albert einstein proved reality molecules motions producing first statistical physics analysis brownian motion567 french physicist jean perrin used einsteins work experimentally determine mass dimensions atoms thereby conclusively verifying daltons atomic theory8
