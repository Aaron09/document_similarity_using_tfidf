physics gravitational field model used explain influence massive body extends space around producing force another massive body1 thus gravitational field used explain gravitational phenomena measured newtons kilogram original concept gravity force point masses following isaac newton pierresimon laplace attempted model gravity kind radiation field fluid since 19th century explanations gravity usually taught terms field model rather point attraction
field model rather particles attracting particles distort spacetime mass distortion perceived measured force model states matter moves certain ways response curvature spacetime2 either gravitational force3 gravity fictitious force4
