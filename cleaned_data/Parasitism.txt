evolutionary strategiesedit




micropredator typical parasite parasitoid predator strategies compared interactions hosts form continuum micropredation parasitoidy considered evolutionary strategies within parasitism5






acrodactyla quadrisculpta parasitoid wasp host spider parasitoids parasites eventually kill hosts5


major evolutionary strategies within parasitism apply parasites whose hosts plants well animals514

parasitic castrators feed hosts reproductive tissues leaving bodily processes largely intact therefore ensuring hosts survival freedom parasite remain host body long host continues live5
directly transmitted parasites rely happenstance encounters members host species feed reproduce spread host another skintoskin contact dormant host steps brushes them5
trophically transmitted parasites life cycle involving hosts juvenile stage infect often encyst animal intermediate host animal eaten predator parasite survives digestion process matures adult predator thus become definitive host parasite parasites capable modifying behavior intermediate hosts order increase chances eaten predator5
vectortransmitted parasites rely third party carry host another often microscopic nonanimal parasites namely protozoa bacteria viruses vectors often parasitic arthropods fleas lice ticks mosquitoes5
parasitoids kill hosts thus migrate hosts frequently5
micropredators actively hunt hosts manner traditional predators micropredators choose hosts large helpless ineffective resisting attack example mosquito attacks animals slow protect bite5 similarly phytophagous scale insects aphids caterpillars attack much larger plants serve vectors bacteria fungi viruses causing plant diseases plants defoliated caterpillars parasitoidy female scale insects unable move obligate parasites permanently attached hosts14

strategies successful parasitism adaptive peaks many intermediate strategies possible organisms many different groups consistently converged evolutionarily stable5

kleptoparasitism greek κλέπτης kleptes thief parasites appropriate food gathered host example brood parasitism practiced cowbirds whydahs cuckoos blackheaded ducks build nests leave eggs nests species host behaves babysitter raise young host removes cuckoos eggs cuckoos return attack nest compel host birds remain subject parasitism25
intraspecific social parasitism also occur parasitic nursing individual young take milk unrelated females wedgecapped capuchins higher ranking females sometimes take milk ranking females without reciprocation high ranking females benefit expense ranking females26
parasitism take form isolated cheating exploitation among generalized mutualistic interactions example broad classes plants fungi exchange carbon nutrients common mutualistic mycorrhizal relationships however plant species known mycoheterotrophs cheat taking carbon fungus rather donating it27

parasitism arisen independently many times depending definition used many half animals least parasitic phase life cycles49 frequent plants fungi almost freeliving animals host parasitic taxa49 harder demonstrate fossil record example holes skulls several specimens tyrannosaurus caused trichomonaslike parasites50
coevolution cospeciationedit
information coevolution hostparasite coevolution
parasite sometimes undergoes cospeciation host example simian foamy virus primate hosts phylogenies polymerase mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit african asian primates found closely congruent branching order divergence times implying simian foamy viruses cospeciated world primates least million years51
presumption shared evolutionary history parasites hosts sometimes elucidate host taxa related instance dispute whether flamingos closely related storks ducks fact flamingos share parasites ducks geese initially taken evidence groups closely related either storks however evolutionary events duplication extinction parasite species without similar events host phylogeny often erode similarities host parasite phylogenies case flamingos similar lice grebes flamingos grebes common ancestor implying cospeciation birds lice groups flamingo lice switched hosts ducks creating situation confused biologists52
coevolution favoring mutualismedit




gramnegative bacterium wolbachia within insect cell


longterm coevolution sometimes leads relatively stable relationship tending commensalism mutualism else equal evolutionary interest parasite host thrives parasite evolve become less harmful host host evolve cope unavoidable presence parasite—to point parasites absence causes host harm example although animals infected parasitic worms often clearly harmed therefore parasitized infections also reduce prevalence effects autoimmune disorders animal hosts including humans53 extreme example nematode worms cannot reproduce even survive without infection wolbachia bacteria54
lynn margulis others argued following peter kropotkins 1902 mutual factor evolution natural selection drives relationships parasitism mutualism resources limited process involved symbiogenesis formed eukaryotes intracellular relationship archaea bacteria though sequence events remains largely undefined5556
competition favoring virulenceedit
competition parasites expected favor faster reproducing therefore virulent parasites natural selection57 parasites whose life cycle involves death host exit present host sometimes enter next evolve virulent alter behavior properties host make vulnerable predators3
however among competing parasitic insectkilling bacteria genera photorhabdus xenorhabdus virulence depended relative potency antimicrobial toxins bacteriocins produced strains involved bacterium could kill strain excluded competition caterpillars infected bacteria toxins able kill strain neither strain excluded virulence less insect infected single strain57
conversely parasites whose reproduction largely tied hosts reproductive success tend become less virulent mutualist hosts reproduce effectively3

modifying host behavioredit
information behavioraltering parasites
parasites modify host behavior order increase transmission hosts often relation predator prey parasite increased trophic transmission example california salt marshes fluke euhaplorchis californiensis reduces ability killifish host avoid predators58 parasite matures egrets likely feed infected killifish uninfected fish another example protozoan toxoplasma gondii parasite matures cats carried many mammals uninfected rats avoid odors rats infected gondii drawn scent increase transmission feline hosts59

parasite ecology complex usually involving hosts multiple parasites multiparasite hosts parasites multiple hosts multihost parasites competition within host interactions affect parasite host reproduction therefore evolution including virulence parasites methods transmission reviewing field rigaud colleagues noted 2010 among outcomes demonstrated empirically multiple infection affect virulence trigger evolutionary change parasites involved host contrasting transmission modes assemblages multiple parasites virulent would expected individual parasite rigaud colleagues also consider tradeoffs virulence among hosts adaptation higher virulence host means lower virulence others predicting many hosts outcome nonspecialist parasites relatively virulence hosts differ quality rigaud colleagues predict parasites become optimally virulent primary host hand also predict diverse host community lower incidence parasites infecting hosts unsuitable resistant means loss parasites wasted transmission65
extended phenotypeedit
information extended phenotype
evolutionary biologist richard dawkins argued 1989 book organisms extended phenotype consists expression genes among things artefacts parasites suggested could apply endoparasites cuckoos briefly come contact hosts66
valueedit
although parasites generally considered harmful eradication parasites would necessarily beneficial parasites account least half lifes diversity perform important ecological role weakening prey ecosystems would take time adapt without parasites organisms eventually tend asexual reproduction diminishing diversity sexually dimorphic traits67 parasites provide opportunity transfer genetic material species rare significant occasions facilitate evolutionary changes would otherwise occur would otherwise take even longer3
although parasites often omitted depictions food webs usually occupy position parasites function like keystone species reducing dominance superior competitors allowing competing species coexist686970
many parasites require multiple hosts different species complete life cycles rely predatorprey stable ecological interactions host another sense parasites ecosystem reflect health system71
