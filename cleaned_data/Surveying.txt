errors accuracyedit
basic tenet surveying measurement perfect always small amount error13 three classes survey errors

gross errors blunders errors made surveyor survey upsetting instrument misaiming target writing wrong measurement gross errors large gross error reduce accuracy unacceptable level therefore surveyors redundant measurements independent checks detect errors early survey
systematic errors follow consistent pattern examples include effects temperature chain measurement poorly adjusted spiritlevel causing tilted instrument target pole systematic errors known effects compensated corrected
random random errors small unavoidable fluctuations caused imperfections measuring equipment eyesight conditions minimized redundancy measurement avoiding unstable conditions random errors tend cancel checks must made ensure propagating measurement next

surveyors avoid errors calibrating equipment using consistent methods good design reference network repeated measurements averaged outlier measurements discarded independent checks like measuring point locations using different methods used errors detected comparing results measurements
surveyor calculated level errors work adjusted process distributing error measurements observation weighted according much total error likely caused part error allocated proportional common methods adjustment bowditch method also known compass rule principle least squares method
