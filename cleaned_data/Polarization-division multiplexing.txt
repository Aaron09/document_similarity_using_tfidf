polarization techniques long used radio transmission reduce interference channels particularly frequencies beyond
circumstances data rate radio link doubled transmitting separate channels radio waves frequency using orthogonal polarization example point point terrestrial microwave links transmitting antenna feed antennas vertical feed antenna transmits microwaves electric field vertical vertical polarization horizontal feed antenna transmits microwaves frequency electric field horizontal horizontal polarization separate channels received vertical horizontal feed antennas receiving station satellite communications orthogonal circular polarization often used instead right lefthanded sense circular polarization changed relative orientation antenna space
dual polarization system comprises usually independent transmitters connected means waveguide lines coaxial cables stripline quasitem microstrip singlepolarization antenna standard operation although separate singlepolarization antennas used adjacent feeds reflector antenna radiating independent polarization states often easily achieved means single dualpolarization antenna
transmitter waveguide interface typically rectangular order singlemode regione operating frequency dualpolarized antenna circular square waveguide port radiating element chosen modern communication systems circular square waveguide port needed least degenerate modes supported adhoc component must therefore introduced situations merge separate singlepolarized signals dualpolarized physical interface namely orthomode transducer
case transmitter quasitem output connections instead dualpolarization antenna often presents separate connections printed square patch antenna feed points embeds function means intrinsically transferring excitation signals orthogonal polarization states
dualpolarized signal thus carries independent data streams receiving antenna singlepolarized receiving streams time dualpolarized model relaying received signal singlepolarization output connectors waveguide
ideal dualpolarization system lies foundation onto perfect orthogonality polarization states singlepolarized interfaces receiver would theoretically contain signal meant transmitted desired polarization thus introducing interference allowing data streams multiplexed demultiplexed transparently without degradation coexistence

crosspolarization interference cancellation xpicedit
practical systems however suffer nonideal behaviors signals polarization states together

transmitting side finite crosspolarization discrimination thus leaks part signals meant transmitted polarization
transmitting antenna finite thus leaks part input polarizations radiated polarization state
propagation presence rain snow hail creates depolarization part impinging polarizations leaked
finite receiving antenna acts similarly transmitting side relative alignment antennas contributes loss system
finite receiving likewise mixes signals dualpolarized port singlepolarized ports

consequence signal received singlepolarization terminals actually contains dominant quantity desired signal meant transmitted onto polarization minor amount undesired signal meant transported polarization represents interference former consequence received signal must cleared interference level order reach required signaltonoiseandinterference ratio snir needed receiving stages order highlevel mqam schemes operation carried crosspolarizationinterference cancellation xpic typically implemented baseband digital stage
compared spatial multiplexing received signals system much favourable carriertointerference ratio amount leakage often much smaller useful signal whereas spatial multiplexing operates amount interference equal amount useful signal observation valid good design allows adaptive xpic designed simpler manner general mimo cancelling scheme since starting point without cancellation typically already sufficient establishing lowcapacity link means reduced modulation
