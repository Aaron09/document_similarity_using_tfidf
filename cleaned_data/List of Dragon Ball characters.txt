creation conception
akira toriyama initially based characters chinese novel journey west12 goku wukong bulma xuanzang oolong bajie yamcha wujing redeveloped earlier oneshot manga series dragon boy3 creative character toriyama stated 1995 designed goku monkey like journey west character humanlooking monkeys tail give distinguishing feature4 however 2003 elaborated saying added tail editor told without goku distinguishing features even though probably joke went ahead toriyama later stated tail pain draw hence early never thought making goku alien vegeta appeared7
going normal convention strongest characters largest terms physical size designed many dragon balls powerful characters small statures8 later explained goku grow means make drawing fight scenes easier even though editor initially rare main character manga series change drastically9 reason many anthropomorphic characters simply finds easier make look different animals rather humans10 female characters toriyama created women deemed beautiful sexy also strong8 however state trouble drawing females reason women dragon ball5 second half series toriyama placed less emphasis imagery simplifying lines sometimes making things square found problems determining colors sometimes altered midstory3
additional characters kamesennin kuririn martial arts tournaments added give manga greater emphasis fighting4 knowing readers would expect goku tournaments toriyama lose first continuing plan eventual victory4 fights manga characters place nobody lived avoid difficulties drawing destroyed buildings11 toriyama came ribbon army particularly muscle tower video game spartan enemies tend appear fast4 said created piccolo daimao villains point something likeable character born attempt truly evil opponent4 ginyu force poses influenced sentai tokusatsu television shows watched children412 toriyama created androids kazuhiko torishima former editor disappointed androids villains13 torishima belittled well created cell13 cell also altered outside opinion given ability transform toriyamas thencurrent editor kondō said ugly13 toriyama also designed characters exclusive animated movies bojack broly tapion minoshia recently beerus whis1415
many dragon balls characters names puns match characters related example bulma family named undergarments saiyans named vegetables freeza freezer ginyu force named products keeps refrigerator7 order advance story quickly introduced gokus signature flying cloud gave fighters ability later granted goku teleportation11 toriyama explained like giving names techniques editors opinion11 wife named series signature kamehameha かめはめ波 kamehame wave named others even selecting specifically character saying someone like vegeta would names english using kanji sophisticated piccolo11 idea characters fuse together suggested longtime friend fellow manga artist masakazu katsura leading fusion フュージョン fyūjon technique1416
