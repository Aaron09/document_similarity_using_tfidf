overviewedit
data model2 similar classical conceptual modeling approaches entity–relationship class diagrams based idea making statements resources particular resources expressions form subject–predicate–object known triples subject denotes resource predicate denotes traits aspects resource expresses relationship subject object
example represent notion color blue triple subject denoting predicate denoting color object denoting blue therefore uses subject instead object entity contrast typical approach entity–attribute–value model objectoriented design entity attribute color value blue
abstract model several serialization formats file formats particular encoding resources triples varies format format
mechanism describing resources major component w3cs semantic activity evolutionary stage world wide automated software store exchange machinereadable information distributed throughout turn enabling users deal information greater efficiency certainty rdfs simple data model ability model disparate abstract concepts also increasing knowledge management applications unrelated semantic activity
collection statements intrinsically represents labeled directed multigraph theory makes data model better suited certain kinds knowledge representation relational ontological models however practice data often stored relational database native representations also called triplestores—or quad stores context named graph also stored triple3
rdfs demonstrate build additional ontology languages upon

several common serialization formats including

turtle25 compact humanfriendly format
ntriples26 simple easytoparse linebased format compact turtle
nquads2728 superset ntriples serializing multiple graphs
jsonld29 jsonbased serialization
notation3 nonstandard serialization similar turtle additional features ability define inference rules
rdfxml30 xmlbased syntax first standard format serializing

rdfxml sometimes misleadingly called simply introduced among specifications defining historically first standard serialization format however important distinguish rdfxml format abstract model although rdfxml format still serializations preferred many users humanfriendly31 graphs representable rdfxml restrictions syntax qnames
little effort virtually arbitrary also interpreted using grddl pronounced griddle gleaning resource descriptions dialects languages
triples stored type database called triplestore
resource identificationedit
subject statement either uniform resource identifier blank node denote resources resources indicated blank nodes called anonymous resources directly identifiable statement predicate also indicates resource representing relationship object blank node unicode string literal resources identified iris generalization uri32
semantic applications relatively popular applications like foaf friend friend resources tend represented uris intentionally denote used access actual data world wide general limited description internetbased resources fact names resource dereferenceable example begins http used subject statement necessarily represent resource accessible http need represent tangible networkaccessible resource could represent absolutely anything however broad agreement bare without symbol returns 300level coded response used http request treated denoting internet resource succeeds accessing
therefore producers consumers statements must agree semantics resource identifiers agreement inherent although controlled vocabularies common dublin core metadata partially mapped space intent publishing rdfbased ontologies often establish circumscribe intended meanings resource identifiers used express data example

httpwwww3orgtr2004recowlguide20040210winemerlot

intended owners refer class merlot wines vintner instances represent class wine produced single vintner definition expressed ontology document occurs without careful analysis definition might erroneously conclude instance something physical instead type wine
note bare resource identifier rather reference containing character ending fragment identifier
statement reification contextedit
body knowledge modeled collection statements subjected reification statement triple subjectpredicateobject altogether assigned treated resource additional statements made jane says john author document reification sometimes important order deduce level confidence degree usefulness statement
reified database original statement resource likely least three additional statements made assert subject resource assert predicate resource assert object resource literal statements original statement also exist depending applications needs
borrowing concepts available logic illustrated graphical notations conceptual graphs topic maps model implementations acknowledge sometimes useful group statements according different criteria called situations contexts scopes discussed articles specification coeditor graham klyne3334 example statement associated context named order assert true relationship another example sometimes convenient group statements source identified particular rdfxml document updates made source corresponding statements changed model well
implementation scopes necessarily require fully reified statements implementations allow single scope identifier associated statement assigned itself3536 likewise named graphs triples named represent context without need reify triples37
query inference languagesedit
main article query language
predominant query language graphs sparql sparql sqllike language recommendation january 2008
example sparql query show country capitals africa using fictional ontology


prefix httpexamplecomexampleontology
select capital country

excityname capital
exiscapitalof
excountryname country
exisincontinent exafrica


nonstandard ways query graphs include

rdql precursor sparql sqllike
versa compact syntax non–sqllike solely implemented 4suite python
first declarative languages uniformly querying schemas resource descriptions implemented rdfsuite38
serql part sesame
template element declare rules matching data uses extensively databinding

validation descriptionedit
main article query language
several proposals validate describe

shacl shapes constraint language expresses constraints graphs shacl divided parts shacl core shaclsparql shacl core consists list builtin constraints cardinality range values many others shaclsparql consists features shacl core plus advanced features sparqlbased constraints extension mechanism declare constraint components
shex shape expressions concise language validation description
