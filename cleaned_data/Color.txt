electromagnetic radiation characterized wavelength frequency intensity wavelength within visible spectrum range wavelengths humans perceive approximately known visible light
light sources emit light many different wavelengths sources spectrum distribution giving intensity wavelength although spectrum light arriving given direction determines color sensation direction many possible spectral combinations color sensations fact formally define color class spectra give rise color sensation although classes would vary widely among different species lesser extent among individuals within species class members called metamers color question

spectral colors color reproduction




1931 color space chromaticity diagram outer curved boundary spectral monochromatic locus wavelengths shown nanometers colors depicted depend color space device viewing image therefore strictly accurate representation color particular position especially monochromatic colors


light sources mixtures various wavelengths light many sources still effectively produce spectral color cannot distinguish singlewavelength sources example computer displays reproduce spectral color orange combination green light appears orange green mixed right proportions allow eyes cones respond spectral color orange
useful concept understanding perceived color nonmonochromatic light source dominant wavelength identifies single wavelength light produces sensation similar light source dominant wavelength roughly akin
many color perceptions definition cannot pure spectral colors desaturation purples mixtures violet light opposite ends spectrum examples necessarily nonspectral colors achromatic colors black gray white colors pink magenta
different light spectra effect three color receptors human perceived color metamers color exemplified white light emitted fluorescent lamps typically spectrum narrow bands daylight continuous spectrum human cannot tell difference light spectra looking light source although reflected colors objects look different often exploited example make fruit tomatoes look intensely
similarly human color perceptions generated mixture three colors called primaries used reproduce color scenes photography printing television media number methods color spaces specifying color terms three particular primary colors method advantages disadvantages depending particular application
mixture colors however produce response truly identical spectral color although close especially longer wavelengths 1931 color space chromaticity diagram nearly straight edge example mixing green light blue light produces cyan light slightly desaturated response color receptor would greater green blue light mixture would pure cyan light intensity mixture blue green
primaries color printing systems generally pure colors reproduced never perfectly saturated spectral colors spectral colors cannot matched exactly however natural scenes rarely contain fully saturated colors thus scenes usually approximated well systems range colors reproduced given color reproduction system called gamut chromaticity diagram used describe gamut
another problem color reproduction systems connected acquisition devices like cameras scanners characteristics color sensors devices often characteristics receptors human effect acquisition colors relatively poor special often jagged spectra caused example unusual lighting photographed scene color reproduction system tuned human normal color vision give inaccurate results observers
different color response different devices problematic properly managed color information stored transferred digital form color management techniques based profiles help avoid distortions reproduced colors color management circumvent gamut limitations particular output devices assist finding good mapping input colors gamut reproduced
