urarina shaman 1988


although north central america diverse areas south america linguistic diversity rivalled places world approximately languages still spoken estimated 1500 languages first european contact situation language documentation classification genetic families advanced north america relatively well studied many areas kaufman 1994 gives following appraisal

since 1950s amount published material south america gradually growing even number researchers smaller growing number linguistic communities whose speech documented given current employment opportunities likely number specialists indian languages increase fast enough document surviving languages unavoidably work languishes personal files published standard problem
fair guinea linguistically poorest documented parts world however early 1960s fairly systematic efforts launched papua guinea area much smaller sure general much better documented part indigenous comparable size

result many relationships languages language families determined relationships proposed somewhat shaky ground
list language families isolates unclassified languages rather conservative based campbell 1997 many proposed often speculative groupings families seen campbell 1997 gordon 2005 kaufman 1990 1994 1979 loukotka 1968 language stock proposals section
