general rulesedit

many assimilations consonant neighboring consonant occurred development pali producing large number geminate double consonants since aspiration geminate consonant phonetically detectable last consonant cluster geminate appear khkh ghgh
assimilation would produce geminate consonant sequence unaspirated stopaspirated stop beginning word initial geminate simplified single consonant




examples prāṇa pāṇa ppāṇa sthavira thera tthera dhyāna jhāna jjhāna jñāti ñāti ññāti




assimilation would produce sequence three consonants middle word geminates simplified consonants sequence




examples uttrāsa uttāsa utttāsa mantra manta mantta indra inda indda vandhya vañjha vañjjha




sequence resulting assimilation changes




example sarva savva sabba pravrajati pavvajati pabbajati divya divva dibba nirvāṇa nivvāṇa nibbāna



total assimilationedit
total assimilation sound becomes identical neighboring sound types progressive assimilated sound becomes identical following sound regressive becomes identical preceding sound
regressive assimilationsedit

internal visarga assimilates following voiceless stop sibilant




examples duḥkṛta dukkata duḥkha dukkha duḥprajña duppañña niḥkrodha niṣkrodha nikkodha niḥpakva niṣpakva nippakka niḥśoka nissoka niḥsattva nissatta
