creation historyedit




friedrich august kekulé stradonitz


need international standard chemistry first addressed 1860 committee headed german scientist friedrich august kekulé stradonitz committee first international conference create international naming system organic compounds11 ideas formulated conference evolved official iupac nomenclature organic chemistry11 iupac stands legacy meeting making important historical international collaborations chemistry societies11 since time iupac official organization held responsibility updating maintaining official organic nomenclature13 iupac established 191914 notable country excluded early iupac germany germanys exclusion result prejudice towards germans allied powers world germany finally admitted iupac 1929 however nazi germany removed iupac world
world iupac affiliated allied powers little involvement effort east west germany eventually readmitted iupac1516 since world iupac focused standardizing nomenclature methods science without interruption
2016 iupac denounced chlorine chemical weapon organization pointed concerns letter ahmet üzümcü director organisation prohibition chemical weapons opcw regards practice utilizing chlorine weapon usage syria among locations letter stated organizations deplore chlorine manner indiscriminate attacks possibly carried member state chemical weapons convention concern chemical scientists engineers around globe stand ready support mission implementing according stockpiling distribution development storage chemical weapons forbidden state party signatories17
committees governanceedit
iupac governed several committees different responsibilities committees follows bureau chemrawn chem research applied world needs committee committee chemistry education committee chemistry industry committee printed electronic publications evaluation committee executive committee finance committee interdivisional committee terminology nomenclature symbols project committee pure applied chemistry editorial advisory board5 committee made members different national adhering organizations different countries2
steering committee hierarchy iupac follows18

committees allotted budget must adhere

nomenclatureedit
main article preferred iupac name
iupac committee long history officially naming organic inorganic compounds iupac nomenclature developed compound named standardized rules avoid duplicate names first publication information international congress applied chemistry26 iupac nomenclature organic compounds found early 20th century guide iupac nomenclature organic compounds 1900
organic nomenclatureedit
iupac organic nomenclature three basic parts substituents carbon chain length chemical ending13 substituents functional groups attached main carbon chain main carbon chain longest possible continuous chain chemical ending denotes type molecule example ending denotes single bonded carbon chain hexane

1427
another example iupac organic nomenclature cyclohexanol





cyclohexanol




substituent name ring compound cyclo
indication substituent name carbon chain
chemical ending single bonded carbon chain
chemical ending alcohol
chemical endings combined ending anol indicating single bonded carbon chain alcohol attached it132728

inorganic nomenclatureedit
basic iupac inorganic nomenclature main parts cation anion cation name positively charged anion name negatively charged ion13
example iupac nomenclature inorganic chemistry potassium chlorate kclo3





potassium chlorate




potassium cation name
chlorate anion name13

amino acid nucleotide base codesedit
iupac also system giving codes identify amino acids nucleotide bases iupac needed coding system represented long sequences amino acids would allow sequences compared find homologies29 codes consist either letter code three letter code
codes make easier shorter write amino acid sequences make proteins nucleotide bases made purines adenine guanine pyrimidines cytosine thymine uracil nucleotide bases make nucleotide base codes make genome organism much smaller easier read30
