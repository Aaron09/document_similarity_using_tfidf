types proxy serversedit
proxy server reside users local computer various points users computer destination servers internet

proxy server passes unmodified requests responses usually called gateway sometimes tunneling proxy
forward proxy internetfacing proxy used retrieve wide range sources cases anywhere internet
reverse proxy usually internalfacing proxy used frontend control protect access server private network reverse proxy commonly also performs tasks loadbalancing authentication decryption caching

open proxiesedit




open proxy forwarding requests anywhere internet


main article open proxy
open proxy forwarding proxy server accessible internet user gordon lyon estimates hundreds thousands open proxies internet3 anonymous open proxy allows users conceal address browsing using internet services varying degrees anonymity however well number methods tricking client revealing regardless proxy used
reverse proxiesedit




reverse proxy taking requests internet forwarding servers internal network making requests connect proxy aware internal network


main article reverse proxy
reverse proxy surrogate proxy server appears clients ordinary server reverse proxies forward requests ordinary servers handle request response proxy server returned came directly original server leaving client knowledge origin servers4 reverse proxies installed neighborhood servers traffic coming internet destination neighborhoods servers goes proxy server reverse originates counterpart forward proxy since reverse proxy sits closer server serves restricted websites several reasons installing reverse proxy servers

encryption acceleration secure sites created secure sockets layer encryption often done server reverse proxy equipped acceleration hardware furthermore host provide single proxy provide encryption arbitrary number hosts removing need separate server certificate host downside hosts behind proxy share common name address connections problem partly overcome using subjectaltname feature x509 certificates
load balancing reverse proxy distribute load several servers server serving application area case reverse proxy need rewrite urls page translation externally known urls internal locations
servecache static content reverse proxy offload servers caching static content like pictures static graphical content
compression proxy server optimize compress content speed load time
spoon feeding reduces resource usage caused slow clients servers caching content server sent slowly spoon feeding client especially benefits dynamically generated pages
security proxy server additional layer defence protect server specific attacks however provide protection attacks application service generally considered larger threat
extranet publishing reverse proxy server facing internet used communicate firewall server internal organization providing extranet access functions keeping servers behind firewalls used security measures considered protect rest infrastructure case server compromised application exposed attack internet

usesedit
monitoring filteringedit
contentcontrol softwareedit
information contentcontrol software
contentfiltering proxy server provides administrative control content relayed directions proxy commonly used commercial noncommercial organizations especially schools ensure internet usage conforms acceptable policy
content filtering proxy often support user authentication control access also usually produces logs either give detailed information urls accessed specific users monitor bandwidth usage statistics also communicate daemonbased andor icapbased antivirus software provide security virus malware scanning incoming content real time enters network
many work places schools colleges restrict sites online services accessible available buildings governments also censor undesirable content done either specialized proxy called content filter commercial free products available using cacheextension protocol icap allows plugin extensions open caching architecture
ironically websites commonly used students circumvent filters access blocked content often include proxy user access websites filter trying block
requests filtered several methods blacklists blacklist regex filtering mime filtering content keyword filtering products known employ content analysis techniques look traits commonly used certain types content providerscitation needed blacklists often provided maintained webfiltering companies often grouped categories pornography gambling shopping social networks
assuming requested acceptable content fetched proxy point dynamic filter applied return path example jpeg files could blocked based fleshtone matches language filters could dynamically detect unwanted language content rejected http fetch error returned requester
filtering companies internetwide crawling robot assesses likelihood content certain type resultant database corrected manual labor based complaints known flaws contentmatching algorithms
proxies scan outbound content data loss prevention scan content malicious software
filtering encrypted dataedit
filtering proxies able peer inside secure sockets http transactions assuming chainoftrust ssltls transport layer security tampered
ssltls chainoftrust relies trusted root certificate authorities workplace setting client managed organization trust might granted root certificate whose private known proxy consequently root certificate generated proxy installed browser list staff
situations proxy analysis contents ssltls transaction becomes possible proxy effectively operating maninthemiddle attack allowed clients trust root certificate proxy owns
bypassing filters censorshipedit
destination server filters content based origin request proxy circumvent filter example server using ipbased geolocation restrict service certain country accessed using proxy located country access service
proxies common means bypassing government censorship although internet users circumvention tools5
cases users circumvent proxies filter using blacklists using services designed proxy information nonblacklisted location6





many schools block access popular websites facebook students proxy servers circumvent security however connecting proxy servers might opening danger passing sensitive information personal photos passwords proxy server content filters block proxy servers order keep users using bypass filter



logging eavesdroppingedit
proxies installed order eavesdrop upon dataflow client machines content sent accessed including passwords submitted cookies used captured analyzed proxy operator reason passwords online services webmail banking always exchanged cryptographically secured connection chaining proxies reveal data original requester possible obfuscate activities eyes users destination however traces left intermediate hops could used offered trace users activities policies administrators proxies unknown user fall victim false sense security details sight mind inconvenience risk proxy users find blocked certain sites numerous forums sites block addresses proxies known spammed trolled site proxy bouncing used maintain privacy
improving performanceedit
caching proxy server accelerates service requests retrieving content saved previous request made client even clients caching proxies keep local copies frequently requested resources allowing large organizations significantly reduce upstream bandwidth usage costs significantly increasing performance isps large businesses caching proxy caching proxies first kind proxy server proxies commonly used cache pages server7 poorly implemented caching proxies cause problems inability user authentication8
proxy designed mitigate specific link related issues degradations performance enhancing proxy peps typically used improve performance presence high roundtrip times high packet loss wireless mobile phone networks highly asymmetric links featuring different upload download rates peps make efficient network example merging acks acknowledgements compressing data sent application layer9
another important proxy server reduce hardware cost organization many systems network control single server prohibiting possibility individual connection internet system case individual systems connected proxy server proxy server connected main server
translationedit
translation proxy proxy server used localize website experience different markets traffic global audiences routed translation proxy source website visitors browse proxied site requests back source site pages rendered original language content response replaced translated content passes back proxy translations used translation proxy either machine translation human translation combination machine human translation different translation proxy implementations different capabilities allow customization source site local audiences excluding source content substituting source content original local content
accessing services anonymouslyedit
main article anonymizer
anonymous proxy server sometimes called proxy generally attempts anonymize surfing different varieties anonymizers destination server server ultimately satisfies request receives requests anonymizing proxy server thus receive information users address requests anonymous anonymizing proxy server however degree trust present proxy server user many proxy servers funded continued advertising link user
access control proxy servers implement logon requirement large organizations authorized users must gain access organization thereby track usage individuals anonymizing proxy servers forward data packets header lines httpvia httpxforwardedfor httpforwarded reveal address client anonymizing proxy servers known elite highanonymity proxies make appear proxy server client website could still suspect proxy used client sends packets include cookie previous visit highanonymity proxy server clearing cookies possibly cache would solve problem
geotargeted advertisingedit
advertisers proxy servers validating checking quality assurance geotargeted geotargeting server checks request source address uses geoip database determine geographic source requests10 using proxy server physically located inside specific country city gives advertisers ability test geotargeted
securityedit
proxy keep internal network structure company secret using network address translation help security internal network11 makes requests machines users local network anonymous proxies also combined firewalls
incorrectly configured proxy provide access network otherwise isolated internet3
crossdomain resourcesedit
proxies allow sites make requests externally hosted resources images music files crossdomain restrictions prohibit site linking directly outside domains proxies also allow browser make requests externally hosted content behalf website crossdomain restrictions place protect websites likes data theft prohibit browser directly accessing outside domains

proxies allow http connect method forwarding arbitrary data connection common policy forward port allow https traffic
examples proxy servers include apache modproxy traffic server haproxy configured proxy application request routing nginx privoxy squid varnish reverse proxy wingate ziproxy tinyproxy rabbit4 polipo
socks proxyedit
socks also forwards arbitrary data connection phase similar http connect proxies
transparent proxyedit
also known intercepting proxy inline proxy forced proxy transparent proxy intercepts normal communication network layer without requiring special client configuration clients need aware existence proxy transparent proxy normally located client internet proxy performing functions gateway router14
2616 hypertext transfer protocol—http11 offers standard definitions

transparent proxy proxy modify request response beyond required proxy authentication identification
nontransparent proxy proxy modifies request response order provide added service user agent group annotation services media type transformation protocol reduction anonymity filtering

intercept traffic filtering security feature protects servers flood attacks type denialofservice attack intercept available traffic
2009 security flaw transparent proxies operate published robert auger15 computer emergency response team issued advisory listing dozens affected transparent intercepting proxy servers16
purposeedit
intercepting proxies commonly used businesses enforce acceptable policy ease administrative overheads since client browser configuration required second reason however mitigated features active directory group policy dhcp automatic proxy detection
intercepting proxies also commonly used isps countries save upstream bandwidth improve customer response times caching common countries bandwidth limited island nations must paid
issuesedit
diversion interception connection creates several issues firstly original destination port must somehow communicated proxy always possible gateway proxy reside different hosts class cross site attacks depend certain behaviour intercepting proxies check access information original intercepted destination problem resolved using integrated packetlevel application level appliance software able communicate information packet handler proxy
intercepting also creates problems http authentication especially connectionoriented authentication ntlm client browser believes talking server rather proxy cause problems intercepting proxy requires authentication user connects site also requires authentication
finally intercepting connections cause problems http caches requests responses become uncacheable shared cache
implementation methodsedit
integrated firewall proxy servers routerfirewall host proxy communicating original destination information done method example microsoft wingate
interception also performed using ciscos wccp cache control protocol proprietary protocol resides router configured cache allowing cache determine ports traffic sent transparent redirection router redirection occur ways tunneling layer rewrites layer
traffic reaches proxy machine interception commonly performed network address translation setups invisible client browser leave proxy visible server devices internet side proxy recent linux releases provide tproxy transparent proxy performs iplevel layer transparent interception spoofing outbound traffic hiding proxy address network devices
detectionedit
several methods often used detect presence intercepting proxy server

comparing clients external address address seen external server sometimes examining http headers received server number sites created address issue reporting users address seen site back user page google also returns address seen page user searches
comparing result online checkers accessed using https http intercepting proxies intercept suspicion intercepted examine certificate associated secure site root certificate indicate whether issued purpose intercepting
comparing sequence network hops reported tool traceroute proxied protocol http port proxied protocol smtp port 2517
attempting make connection address known server proxy accept connection attempt proxy proxy finds server accept connection return error message simply close connection client difference behaviour simple detect example browsers generate browser created error page case cannot connect http server return different error case connection accepted closed18
serving enduser specially programmed adobe flash applications java applets send http calls back server

proxyedit
proxy accepts target urls using form users browser window processes request returns results users browser consequently used device network allow true proxy settings changed first recorded proxy developed american computer scientist richard windmann june 199919
majority proxies powered either glype phproxy written language april 2016 glype received almost million downloads20 whilst phproxy still receives hundreds downloads week21 despite waning popularity vpns privacy methods still several thousand proxies online23
proxies purposes making websites accessible disabled people since shut excessive traffic usually caused third party advertising service means bypass local filtering since many users dont care collateral damage causing became necessary organizations hide proxies disclosing urls take trouble contact organization demonstrate genuine needcitation needed
suffix proxyedit
suffix proxy allows user access content appending name proxy server requested content enwikipediaorgsuffixproxycom suffix proxy servers easier regular proxy servers offer high levels anonymity primary bypassing filters however rarely used advanced filters
onion proxy softwareedit
main article anonymity network
