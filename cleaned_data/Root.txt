simplest form term root architecture refers spatial configuration plant’s root system system extremely complex dependent upon multiple factors species plant composition soil availability nutrients5
configuration root systems serves structurally support plant compete plants uptake nutrients soil6 roots grow specific conditions changed impede plants growth example root system developed soil efficient flooded soil plants able adapt changes environment seasonal changes6
root architecture plays important role providing secure supply nutrients water well anchorage support main terms used classify architecture root system are7

branch magnitude number links exterior interior
topology pattern branching including


herringbone alternate lateral branching parent root
dichotomous opposite forked branches
radial whorls branches around root


link length distance branches
root angle radial angle lateral root’s base around parent root’s circumference angle lateral root parent root angle entire system spreads

components root architecture regulated complex interaction genetic responses responses environmental stimuli developmental stimuli categorised intrinsic genetic nutritional influences extrinsic environmental influences interpreted signal transduction pathways8 extrinsic factors affect root architecture include gravity light exposure water oxygen well availability lack nitrogen phosphorus sulphur aluminium sodium chloride main hormones intrinsic stimuli respective pathways responsible root architecture development include

auxin auxin promotes root initiation root emergence primary root elongation
cytokinins cytokinins regulate root apical meristem size promote lateral root elongation
gibberellins together ethylene promote crown primordia growth elongation together auxin promote root elongation gibberellins also inhibit lateral root primordia initiation
ethylene ethylene promotes crown root formation

early root growth functions apical meristem located near root meristem cells less continuously divide producing meristem root cells sacrificed protect meristem undifferentiated root cells latter become primary tissues root first undergoing elongation process pushes root forward growing medium gradually cells differentiate mature specialized cells root tissues9
growth apical meristems known primary growth encompasses elongation secondary growth encompasses growth diameter major component woody plant tissues many nonwoody plants example storage roots sweet potato secondary growth woody secondary growth occurs lateral meristems namely vascular cambium cork cambium former forms secondary xylem secondary phloem latter forms peridermcitation needed
plants secondary growth vascular cambium originating xylem phloem forms cylinder tissue along stem rootcitation needed vascular cambium forms cells inside outside cambium cylinder inside forming secondary xylem cells outside forming secondary phloem cells secondary xylem accumulates girth lateral dimensions stem root increases result tissues beyond secondary phloem including epidermis cortex many cases tend pushed outward eventually sloughed shedcitation needed
point cork cambium begins form periderm consisting protective cork cells containing suberincitation needed roots cork cambium originates pericycle component vascular cylindercitation needed
vascular cambium produces layers secondary xylem annuallycitation needed xylem vessels dead maturity responsible water transport vascular tissue stems rootscitation needed
tree roots usually grow three times diameter branch spread half underneath trunk canopy roots side tree usually supply nutrients foliage side families however sapindaceae maple family show correlation root location root supplies nutrients plantcitation needed
regulationedit
correlation roots using process plant perception sense physical environment grow10 including sensing light11 physical barriers time roots crack foundations snap water lines lift sidewalkscitation needed
correct environment mineral nutrients water directs plant roots grow direction meet plants needs roots shrink away dry12 poor soil conditions
gravitropism directs roots grow downward germination growth mechanism plants also causes shoot grow upward13

adventitious roots arise outofsequence usual root formation branches primary root instead originate stem branches leaves woody roots commonly occur monocots pteridophytes also many dicots clover trifolium hedera strawberry fragaria willow salix aerial roots stilt roots adventitious conifers adventitious roots form largest part root system
aerating roots knee root knee pneumatophores cypress knee roots rising ground especially water mangrove genera avicennia sonneratia plants like avicennia erect roots large number breathing pores exchange gases
aerial roots roots entirely ground hedera epiphytic orchids many aerial roots used receive water nutrient intake directly fogs humidity air14 rely leaf systems gather rain humidity even store scales pockets aerial roots mangrove aerial roots used aeration water absorption aerial roots used mainly structure functioning prop roots maize anchor roots trunk strangler epiphytes plants living surface plants aerial roots serve reaching water sources reaching surface functioning regular surface roots14
contractile roots pull bulbs corms monocots hyacinth lily taproots dandelion deeper soil expanding radially contracting longitudinally wrinkled surface15
coarse roots roots undergone secondary thickening woody structure roots ability absorb water nutrients main function transport provide structure connect smaller diameter fine roots rest plant
dimorphic root systems roots distinctive forms separate functions
fine roots typically primary roots diameter function water nutrient uptake often heavily branched support mycorrhizas roots short lived replaced plant ongoing process root turnover
haustorial roots roots parasitic plants absorb water nutrients another plant mistletoe viscum album dodder
propagative roots roots form adventitious buds develop aboveground shoots termed suckers form plants canada thistle cherry many others
proteoid roots cluster roots dense clusters rootlets limited growth develop phosphate iron conditions proteaceae plants following families betulaceae casuarinaceae elaeagnaceae moraceae fabaceae myricaceae
stilt roots adventitious support roots common among mangroves grow lateral branches branching soil
storage roots roots modified storage food water carrots beets include taproots tuberous roots
structural roots large roots undergone considerable secondary thickening provide mechanical support woody plants trees
surface roots proliferate close soil surface exploiting water easily available nutrients conditions close optimum surface layers soil growth surface roots encouraged commonly become dominant roots
tuberous roots fleshy enlarged lateral roots food water storage sweet potato type storage root distinct taproot
