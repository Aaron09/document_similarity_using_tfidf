boards legal basis cinematograph 1909 required cinemas licences local authorities introduced safety reasons number nitrate film fires unsuitable venues fairgrounds shops hastily converted cinemas following year court ruling7 determined criteria granting refusing licence restricted issues health safety given allowed councils grant refuse licences cinemas according content films showed 1909 therefore enabled introduction censorship

attitudes censorshipedit
historically board faced strong criticism overzealous attitude censoring film prior liberalising decade 1960s films routinely extensively censored means social control example rebel without cause reduce possibility teenage rebellion ingmar bergmans smiles summer night remove overtly sexual provocative language39
bbfcs attitude became liberal 1960s concentrated censoring films featured graphic violence however board decisions caused controversy 1970s banned series films released uncut popular countries texas chain massacre last house left released controversial films straw dogs clockwork orange however recent president andreas whittam smith current incumbent quentin thomas guidelines relaxed allowing release usually uncut previously banned films video cinemas films 1970s remain unreleased40 many titles remain banned primarily distributors chosen resubmit films bbfc almost certainly commercial reasons would likely receive sympathetic hearing years notable examples period include 1969 film love camp rejected 2002 women cellblock released 1977 rejected 2004 films contain substantial scenes sexual violence remained completely banned following resubmission since 2000
general attitudes material suitable viewing younger audiences changed years reflected reclassification older films rereleased video example 1913 film given former rating could probably rated today extreme example rating horror film revenge zombies certificate upon video release late 1990s whereas first examined film 1951 given first ratings bela lugosi horror film island lost souls refused certificate first submitted 1932 granted 1950s home video release 1996 submitted modern video classification 2011 reclassified
bbfc also known words spaz retard certified films videos grounds discrimination though spaz considered derogatory united states united kingdom spaz american slang means someone overreacts minor problem british english slang word spastic british spastics society changed name scope charity word used general term abuse former sense someone particular mental physical disabilities retard however censored american shows derogatory example marmaduke passed word spaz removed uncut version would rated also award higher ratings films contain potentially imitable dangerous behaviour includes three jackass films passed fred movie passed also serious suicide themes references attempts either award higher rating example 2010 board hindi film anjaana anjaani minutes thirtyone seconds remove references sight someone attempting suicide asphyxiation distributor could cinema certificate uncut form film released home video certificate hunger games assessed formal classification films studio wishing obtain financial marketing reasons seven seconds footage blood splashes digitally removed reduce emphasis blood injury alternative uncut film rated
relaxationedit
considerable relaxation since 1999 onwards relaxation guidelines also made hardcore pornography widely available adult audiences rating films rating legally available licensed shops also seen specially licensed cinemas
also examples films stronger sexual content including real images sexual intercourse approved level recent examples include passing irreversible songs antichrist numerous films uncut cinema video viewing despite trend towards liberalisation anticensorship campaigners still critical bbfc attracted criticism conservative press particular daily mail grounds release sexually explicit violent films corrupting nation newspapers famous clash bbfc came 1997 board released david cronenberg film crash without cuts following march 1997 mail banner headline censors depraved film41 westminster city council imposed film decision although anyone wanting watch film cinema walk along nonwestminster half shaftesbury avenue neighbouring borough camden
current concernsedit
bbfcs current guidelines identify number specific areas considered awarding certificates requiring cuts

depictions cruelty harassment based race gender sexual orientation mental physical disability
adult themes situations considered distressing younger sensitive viewers
offensive language profanity racial ethnic slurs
nudity
sexual content including scenes sexual activity spokenvisual references
violence
gore injury detail
sexual violence rape forced disrobing especially
dangerous actions easily imitated younger naive viewers certain combat moves earclaps headbutts neckbreaking particular
visual verbal references suicide particularly involves hanging oneself slashing ones wrists
detailed criminal acts breaking house using credit card jimmy lock hotwiring
actions result injury death real life almost always shown media especially shows aimed younger audiences cartoons negative consequences hiding appliances trap kill small children tumble driers refrigerators ingesting misusing common household chemicals creating dangerous devices common household items flamethrower aerosol cigarette lighter fall category
scenes horror threat danger intensity audience members
drug abuse condoned glamorised

bbfc also continues demand cuts material believes breaches provisions obscene publications legislation notably cinematograph films animals 1937 forbids depiction animals abused distress protection children 1978 amended forbids depiction minors engaged sexually suggestive poses situations 2009 cinema films material videos cuts actually occur videos rated rather videos intended viewing under18s 2009 videos videos material cut37
theme subject matter considered inherently unsuitable classification level although controversial topics drive movie given restrictive rating keeping current practice liberal democracies sharp contrast early days bbfc adult themes prostitution incest relations capital labour unacceptable regardless rating
adult strong language earn film restrictive certificate though bbfc policy states constraints language films awarded certificate difficult compare bbfcs policies area countries different taboos regarding profanity languages indeed englishspeaking countries example strong language little effect films classification france bbfcs policy proved particularly controversial case loachs sweet sixteen 2002 passed uncut certificate even though main characters teenagers frequently used profanities director argued typical social group film depicted film received similar certificates ireland also certificate united states shane meadows film england also passed uncut repeated racist terms climatic scene combo becomes irate pummels friend milky insulting hand films feature strong language nevertheless carry particularly restrictive certificates kings speech passed rating despite repeated word fuck scenes would normally raise rating certificate bbfc justified decision saying profanity speech therapy context
minimal restrictions depiction nonsexual nudity allowed even certificate films example simpsons movie—which given pg13 rating given certificate leaving sequence bart skateboards naked town genitals shown open space hedge unedited scenes simulated sexual activity limited restricted certificates regard material intended primarily pornographic boards policy stated website material appears simulated generally passed images real confined category however years depictions real allowed certificate videos intended educational recent years number works patrice chéreaus intimacy michael winterbottoms songs feature apparently unsimulated passed uncut theatrical release
violence remains problematic areas censorship especially conjunction likely sway impressionable viewers thinking violence depicted glamorous riskfree however board takes account issues context whether considers scenes sexual violence eroticise endorse sexual assault 2002 board passed gaspar noés irréversible uncut less month later takashi miikes ichi killer three quarter minutes remove scenes sexual violence serbian film suffered fortynine individual cuts bbfc totalled four minutes eleven seconds cuts cuts made remove portrayals children sexualised abusive context images sexual sexualised violence tendency eroticise endorse behaviour boards website states
criminal dangerous acts easily imitated well scenes condoning glamorising showing clear instruction abuse drugs also subject editing issue depicting dangerous acts easily imitated real life seem figure especially highly censorship systems countries though done occasion often result public backlash seen shows beavis butthead jackass numerous minor cuts made primarily films whose distributors want certificate scenes characters performing acts would considered dangerous criminal harmful done real life example 2006 issues involving suicide hanging became problematic stimpy show series classified edited remove song lord loves hangin song implied hanging comedic riskfree42 paranoia agent volume classified also remove depiction child nearly hanging reason43
requirement films classified censored cost film producers thousands pounds north west wave blanket term recently used film makers local press describe independent filmmakers northwest england currently campaigning introduction voluntary unrated certificate uk44
june 2011 bbfc refused classification horror film human centipede previous film series passed uncut shift context focus bbfc judged sequel could fall foul obscene publications act45 film eventually passed cuts made46
