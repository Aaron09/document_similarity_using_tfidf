mass movement downward outward movement rock sediments sloped surface mainly force gravity4142

slumping happens steep hillsides occurring along distinct fracture zones often within materials like clay released move quite rapidly downhill often show spoonshaped isostatic depression material begun slide downhill cases slump caused water beneath slope weakening many cases simply result poor engineering along highways regular occurrencecitation needed

factors affecting erosion ratesedit
climateedit
also climatic geomorphology
amount intensity precipitation main climatic factor governing soil erosion water relationship particularly strong heavy rainfall occurs times locations soils surface well protected vegetation might periods agricultural activities leave soil bare semiarid regions vegetation naturally sparse wind erosion requires strong winds particularly times drought vegetation sparse soil erodible climatic factors average temperature temperature range also affect erosion effects vegetation soil properties general given similar vegetation ecosystems areas precipitation especially highintensity rainfall wind storms expected erosion
areas world midwestern rainfall intensity primary determinant erosivity definition erosivity check45 higher intensity rainfall generally resulting soil erosion water size velocity rain drops also important factor larger highervelocity rain drops greater kinetic energy thus impact displace soil particles larger distances smaller slowermoving rain drops4629–31
regions world western europe runoff erosion result relatively intensities stratiform rainfall falling onto previously saturated soil situations rainfall amount rather intensity main factor determining severity soil erosion water15
taiwan typhoon frequency increased significantly 21st century strong link drawn increase storm frequency increase sediment load rivers reservoirs highlighting impacts climate change erosion47
vegetative coveredit
also vegetation slope stability
vegetation acts interface atmosphere soil increases permeability soil rainwater thus decreasing runoff shelters soil winds results decreased wind erosion well advantageous changes microclimate roots plants bind soil together interweave roots forming solid mass less susceptible water48 wind erosion removal vegetation increases rate surface erosion49
topographyedit
topography land determines velocity surface runoff flow turn determines erosivity runoff longer steeper slopes especially without adequate vegetative cover susceptible high rates erosion heavy rains shorter less steep slopes steeper terrain also prone mudslides landslides forms gravitational erosion processes4628–305051
tectonicsedit
main article erosion tectonics
tectonic processes control rates distributions erosion earths surface tectonic action causes part earths surface mountain range raised lowered relative surrounding areas must necessarily change gradient land surface erosion rates almost always sensitive local slope change rates erosion uplifted area active tectonics also brings fresh unweathered rock towards surface exposed action erosion
however erosion also affect tectonic processes removal erosion large amounts rock particular region deposition elsewhere result lightening load lower crust mantle tectonic processes driven gradients stress field developed crust unloading turn cause tectonic isostatic uplift region439952 cases hypothesised twin feedbacks localise enhance zones rapid exhumation deep crustal rocks beneath places earths surface extremely high erosion rates example beneath extremely steep terrain nanga parbat western himalayas place called tectonic aneurysm53
