choosing mission modeedit




john houbolt explaining concept


also moon landing
kennedy defined goal apollo mission planners faced challenge designing spacecraft could meet minimizing risk human life cost demands technology astronaut skill four possible mission modes considered

direct ascent spacecraft would launched unit travel directly moon land would return leaving landing stage moon design would required development extremely powerful nova launch vehicle
earth orbit rendezvous multiple rocket launches plans would carry parts direct ascent spacecraft propulsion units translunar injection would assembled single spacecraft earth orbit
lunar orbit rendezvous single saturn could launch spacecraft composed mother ship would remain orbit around moon smaller twostage lander would carry astronauts surface return dock mother ship discarded landing small part spacecraft moon returning even smaller part lunar orbit minimized total mass launched earth
lunar surface rendezvous spacecraft would launched succession first automated vehicle carrying propellant return earth would land moon followed time later manned vehicle propellant would transferred automated vehicle manned vehicle34





early apollo configuration direct ascent earth orbit rendezvous 1961


early 1961 direct ascent generally mission mode favor nasa many engineers feared rendezvous—let alone docking—neither attempted even earth orbit would extremely difficult lunar orbit dissenters including john houbolt langley research center emphasized important weight reductions offered approach throughout 1960 1961 houbolt campaigned recognition viable practical option bypassing nasa hierarchy sent series memos reports issue associate administrator robert seamans acknowledging spoke somewhat voice wilderness houbolt pleaded discounted studies question35
seamans establishment adhoc committee headed special technical assistant nicholas golovin july 1961 recommend launch vehicle used apollo program represented turning point nasas mission mode decision36 committee recognized chosen mode important part launch vehicle choice recommended favor hybrid eorlor mode consideration lor—as well houbolts ceaseless work—played important role publicizing workability approach late 1961 early 1962 members manned spacecraft center began come around support including newly hired deputy director office manned space flight joseph shea became champion lor37 engineers marshall space flight center msfc much lose decision took longer become convinced merits conversion announced wernher braun briefing june 196238
even nasa reached internal agreement smooth sailing kennedys science advisor jerome wiesner expressed opposition manned spaceflight kennedy president took office39 opposed decision land moon hired golovin left nasa chair space vehicle panel ostensibly monitor actually secondguess nasas decisions saturn launch vehicle forcing shea seamans even webb defend delaying formal announcement press july 1962 forcing webb still hedge decision tentative40
wiesner kept pressure even making disagreement public twoday september visit president marshall space flight center wiesner blurted thats good front press presentation braun webb jumped defended braun kennedy ended squabble stating matter still subject final review webb held firm issued request proposal candidate lunar excursion module contractors wiesner finally relented unwilling settle dispute kennedys office presidents involvement october cuban missile crisis fear kennedys support webb nasa announced selection grumman contractor november 196241
space historian james hansen concludes

without nasas adoption stubbornly held minority opinion 1962 united states still reached moon almost certainly would accomplished 1960s president kennedys target date42
