separately sold msdos predecessor 86dos resembled digital researchs cpm—the dominant disk operating system 8bit intel 8080 zilog microcomputers—but instead intel 8086 16bit processors
introduced built intel 8088 microprocessor needed operating system seeking 8088compatible build initially approached microsoft bill gates possibly believing microsoft owned microsoft softcard allowed apple sent digital research meeting however initial negotiations broke digital research wished sell royalty basis sought single license change name digital research founder gary kildall refused withdrew34
approached bill gates gates turn approached seattle computer products programmer paterson developed variant cpm80 intended internal product testing scps 16bit intel 8086 card s100 system initially named qdos quick dirty operating system made commercially available 86dos microsoft purchased 86dos allegedly 50000 became microsoft disk operating system msdos introduced 19815
within year microsoft licensed msdos companies6 supplied operating system hardware sometimes names microsoft later required msdos name exception variant continued develop version digital research became aware operating system similar sold name insisted upon threatened legal action responded offering agreement would give consumers choice cpm86 kildalls 8086 version sidebyside cost almost sales faded msdos becoming marketed operating system compatibles3
microsoft originally sold msdos original equipment manufacturers oems major reason early compatible structured separation system specific device driver code iosys kernel msdossys microsoft provided adaptation allowed oems customize device driver code particular system early 1990s adhered standards microsoft began selling msdos retail msdos

boot sequenceedit

bootstrap loader pccompatible computers boot sector located track zero first sector disk bios load sector memory address 0000h7c00h typically check signature offset 1feh sector considered valid bios next physical disk otherwise jump load address certain registers
loaded boot sector happens master boot record found partitioned media relocate 0000h0600h memory29 otherwise step skipped code scan partition table located within sector active partition modern mbrs check offset 1beh10hn whereas mbrs simply check value found load first sector corresponding partition holds volume boot record volume memory 0000h7c00h similar fashion loaded bios pass execution loaded portion certain registers
sector content loaded 0000h7c00h constitutes vbrs operating system specific cannot exchanged different versions general exact behaviour differs different versions versions would load whole iosysibmbiocom file memory 0000h0600h30 work sectors stored consecutive order disk later issues would locate store contents first entries root directory 0000h0500h happen reflect correct boot files recorded would load first consecutive sectors iosysibmbiocom file memory 0070h0000h also take care preserve contents disk parameter table finally passes control loaded portion jumping entry point certain registers considerable differences different versions
modern versions loaded first sectors iosysibmbiocom file memory loaded portion contains another boot loader load remainder memory using root directory information stored 0000h0500h versions file contents still need stored consecutive order disk older versions still loaded whole step skipped
system initialization code initial builtin device drivers load kernel located msdossys msdos systems memory well windows system initialization code builtin device drivers kernel combined single iosys file msdossys used text configuration file
configsys file read parse configuration parameters shell variable specifies location shell defaults commandcom
shell loaded executed
startup batch file autoexecbat shell3132

system files loaded boot sector must contiguous first directory entries33 removing adding file likely render media unbootable however possible replace shell method used start execution dedicated applications faster limitation apply version system files located anywhere root directory need contiguous therefore system files simply copied disk provided boot sector compatible already
system files named ibmbiocom instead iosys ibmdoscom instead msdossys older versions used drbiossys drbdossys instead
starting msdos binary system files iosys msdossys combined single file iosys whilst msdossys became configuration file similar configsys autoexecbat msdossys bootgui directive boot process stop command processor typically commandcom loaded instead executing wincom automatically
file systemedit
uses filesystem supports filenames characters filename characters extension starting hierarchical directories supported directory name also format maximum directory path length characters internal current directory structure tables maintains including drive name maximum length fully qualified filename supports characters using format drivepathfilenameext followed null byte
uses file allocation table filesystem originally fat12 supported 4078 clusters drive added support fat16 used 16bit allocation entries supported 65518 clusters drive added support fat16b removed drive limit could support finally msdos component windows added support fat32 used 32bit allocation entries could support hard drives beyond
starting file redirector support added initially used support networking later used support cdrom drives mscdex also preliminary installable file system support unused removed
drive naming schemeedit
main article drive letter assignment
drives referred identifying letters standard practice reserve floppy drives systems floppy drive assigns letters drive prompting user swap disks programs alternate access facilitates copying floppy floppy program floppy accessing data another hard drives originally assigned letters could support active partition drive support hard drives became available developed first assigning drive letter drives active primary partition making second pass drives allocate letters logical drives extended partition third pass give nonactive primary partitions names additional partitions existed contained dossupported file system lastly allocates letters optical disc drives disks hardware letter assignments usually occur order drivers loaded drivers instruct assign different letter drivers network drives example typically assign letters nearer alphabet34
applications drive letters directly unlike directory unixlike systems disrupted adding hardware needs drive letter example addition hard drive primary partition preexisting hard drive contains logical drives extended partitions drive assigned letter previously assigned extended partition logical drives moreover even adding hard drive logical drives extended partition would still disrupt letters disks optical drives problem persisted microsofts dosbased versions windows replaced versions based line preserves letters existing drives user changes them34 problem worked around defining subst drive installing program logical drive assignment drive would changed batch whenever application starts versions concurrent well multiuser system manager real32 reserved drive letter automatically assigned corresponding load drive whenever application starts
reserved device namesedit
main article device file
reserved device names cannot used filenames regardless extension occupied builtin character devices restrictions also affect several windows versions cases causing crashes security vulnerabilities35
reserved names console auxiliary prn36 printer lister introduced 86dos 86dos added except continued supported versions msdos drdos ever since also available versions msdos whereas versions msdos already used lpt1 first line printer com1 first serial communication device instead introduced addition lpt1 lpt2 well com1 com3 hewlettpackards msdos portable plus also supported alias lpt2 82164a alias com23738 also supported plotters3738 otherwise com2 lpt2 lpt3 clock still named clock issues msdos 211393738 clock device introduced com3 com4 added multitasking msdos supported keybd screen higher multiuser support idle device dynamic idle detection saving power improve multitasking lpt4 optional builtin driver fourth line printer supported versions drdos since config constitutes real mode manager msdos 7080
typically defaults com1 lpt1 defaults changed versions point serial parallel devices373840 reconfigurable well3738
filenames ended colon conventionally indicate device names colon actually part name builtin device drivers colons necessary typed cases example


echo achieves nothing

still possible create files directories using reserved device names direct editing directory data structures disk sectors naming starting file name space sometimes used viruses hacking programs obscure files users know access locations

eventually manufacturers major systems began include environment managers msdosibm included shell42 released next year included viewmax based upon gem43
terminate stay residentedit
main article terminate stay resident
multitasking operating system however provide terminate stay resident function allowed programs remain resident memory programs could hook system timer andor keyboard interrupts allow tasks background invoked time preempting current running program effectively implementing simple form multitasking programspecific basis print command implement background print spooling borland sidekick popup personal information manager also used technique
terminate stay resident programs also used provide additional features available default programs like doskey provided command line editing facilities beyond available commandcom programs like microsoft cdrom extensions mscdex provided access files cdrom disks
tsrs could even perform rudimentary form task switching example shareware program back forth 199044 hotkey save state currentlyrunning program disk load another program switch hence possible switch back forth programs albeit slowly disk access required back forth could enable background processing however needed desqview least
