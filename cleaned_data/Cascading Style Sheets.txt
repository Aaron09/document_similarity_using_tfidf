cascading style sheets style sheet language used describing presentation document written markup language1 although often used visual style pages user interfaces written html xhtml language applied document including plain applicable rendering speech media along html javascript cornerstone technology used websites create visually engaging webpages user interfaces applications user interfaces many mobile applications2
designed primarily enable separation presentation content including aspects layout colors fonts3 separation improve content accessibility provide flexibility control specification presentation characteristics enable multiple html pages share formatting specifying relevant separate file reduce complexity repetition structural content
separation formatting content makes possible present markup page different styles different rendering methods onscreen print voice speechbased browser screen reader braillebased tactile devices also display page differently depending screen size viewing device readers also specify different style sheet file stored computer override author specified
changes graphic design document hundreds documents applied quickly easily editing lines file rather changing markup documents
specification describes priority scheme determine style rules apply rule matches particular element socalled cascade priorities weights calculated assigned rules results predictable
specifications maintained world wide consortium internet media type mime type textcss registered 2318 march 1998 operates free validation service documents4

syntaxedit
simple syntax uses number english keywords specify names various style properties
style sheet consists list rules rule ruleset consists selectors declaration block
selectoredit
selectors declare part markup style applies matching tags attributes markup
selectors apply

elements specific type secondlevel headers
elements specified attribute particular

identifier unique within document
class identifier annotate multiple elements document


elements depending placed relative others document tree

classes casesensitive start letters include alphanumeric characters underscores class apply number instances elements applied single element
pseudoclasses used selectors permit formatting based information contained document tree example widely used pseudoclass hover identifies content user points visible element usually holding mouse cursor appended selector ahover elementidhover pseudoclass classifies document elements link visited whereas pseudoelement makes selection consist partial elements firstline firstletter5
selectors combined many ways achieve great specificity flexibility6 multiple selectors joined spaced list specify elements location element type class combination thereof order selectors important example myclass color applies elements class myclass inside elements whereas myclass color applies elements elements class myclass

declaration blockedit
declaration block consists list declarations braces declaration consists property colon value multiple declarations block semicolon must inserted separate declaration8
properties specified standard property possible values properties affect type element others apply particular groups elements9
values keywords center inherit numerical values 200px pixels 50vw percent viewport width percent window width color values specified keywords hexadecimal values ff0000 also abbreviated values scale rgb255 rgba values specify color alpha transparency rgba255 hsla values hsl000 hsla000 8010
useedit
nearly presentational attributes html documents contained within html markup font colors background styles element alignments borders sizes explicitly described often repeatedly within html lets authors move much information another file style sheet resulting considerably simpler html
example headings elements subheadings subsubheadings defined structurally using html print screen choice font size color emphasis elements presentational
document authors wanted assign typographic characteristics headings repeat html presentational markup occurrence heading type made documents complex larger errorprone difficult maintain allows separation presentation structure define color font text alignment size borders spacing layout many typographic characteristics independently onscreen printed views also defines nonvisual styles reading speed emphasis aural text readers deprecated presentational html markup11
example precss html heading element defined text would written


h1font colorred chapter fonth1

using element coded using style properties instead html presentational attributes


stylecolor chapter

advantages immediately clear since second form actually verbose power becomes apparent style properties placed internal style element even better external file example suppose document contains style element


style

elements document automatically become without requiring explicit code author later wanted make elements blue instead could done changing style element

rather laboriously going document changing color individual element
styles also placed external file described loaded using syntax similar

decouples styling html document makes possible restyle multiple documents simply editing shared external file
sourcesedit

style sheet highest priority controls content display declarations highest priority source passed source lower priority user agent style process called cascading
goals allow users greater control presentation someone finds italic headings difficult read apply different style sheet depending browser site user choose various style sheets provided designers remove added styles view site using browsers default styling override italic heading style without altering attributes

browser supportedit
information comparison layout engines cascading style sheets
browser uses layout engine render pages support functionality consistent browsers parse perfectly multiple coding techniques developed target specific browsers workarounds commonly known hacks filters adoption functionality hindered lack support major browsers example internet explorer slow support many features slowed adoption features damaged browsers reputation among developers57 order ensure consistent experience users developers often test sites across multiple operating systems browsers browser versions increasing development time complexity tools browserstack built reduce complexity maintaining environments
addition testing tools many sites maintain lists browser support specific properties including caniuse mozilla developer network additionally defines feature queries provide supports directive allow developers target browsers support certain functionality directly within css58 supported older browsers also sometimes patched using javascript polyfills pieces javascript code designed make browsers behave consistently workarounds—and need support fallback functionality—can complexity development projects consequently companies frequently define list browser versions support
websites adopt newer code standards incompatible older browsers browsers accessing many resources sometimes intentionally59 many popular sites internet visually degraded older browsers poor support work large part evolution javascript technologies
limitationsedit
noted limitations current capabilities include

selectors unable ascend
currently offers select parent ancestor element satisfies certain criteria60 selectors level still working draft status proposes selector61 part complete selector profile fast profile used dynamic styling62 advanced selector scheme xpath would enable sophisticated style sheets major reasons working group previously rejecting proposals parent selectors related browser performance incremental rendering issues63
cannot explicitly declare scope independently position
scoping rules properties zindex look closest parent element positionabsolute positionrelative attribute coupling undesired effects example impossible avoid declaring scope forced adjust elements position preventing using desired scope parent element
pseudoclass dynamic behavior controllable
implements pseudoclasses allow degree user feedback conditional application alternate styles pseudoclass hover dynamic equivalent javascript onmouseover potential abuse implementing cursorproximity popups64 ability client disable disablelike property limit effects nochangelike values property
cannot name rules
name rule would allow example clientside scripts refer rule even selector changes
cannot include styles rule another rule
styles often must duplicated several rules achieve desired effect causing additional maintenance requiring thorough testing features proposed solve february 2016 implemented anywhere65
cannot target specific text without altering markup
besides firstletter pseudoelement cannot target specific ranges text without needing utilize placeholder elements

former issuesedit
additionally several issues present prior versions standard alleviated

vertical control limitations
though horizontal placement elements always generally easy control vertical placement frequently unintuitive convoluted outright impossible simple tasks centering element vertically placing footer higher bottom viewport required either complicated unintuitive style rules simple widely unsupported rules60 flexible module improved situation considerably vertical control much straightforward supported modern browsers66 older browsers still issues mainly internet explorer longer supported vendors67
absence expressions
standard ability specify property values simple expressions marginleft would useful variety cases calculating size columns subject constraint columns internet explorer versions support proprietary expression statement68 similar functionality proprietary expression statement longer supported internet explorer onwards except compatibility modes decision taken standards compliance browser performance security reasons68 however candidate recommendation calc value address limitation published wg69 since supported modern browsers70
lack column declaration
although possible current using columncount module71 layouts multiple columns complex implement process often done using floating elements often rendered differently different browsers different computer screen shapes different screen ratios standard monitors modern browsers support feature form another72

advantagesedit

separation content presentation

main article separation presentation content

facilitates publication content multiple presentation formats based nominal parameters nominal parameters include explicit user preferences different browsers type device used view content desktop computer mobile internet device geographic location user many variables
sitewide consistency

main article style sheet development

used effectively terms inheritance cascading global style sheet used affect style elements sitewide situation arises styling elements changed adjusted changes made editing rules global style sheet sort maintenance difficult expensive timeconsuming
bandwidth
stylesheet internal external specifies style range html elements selected class type relationship others much efficient repeating style information inline occurrence element external stylesheet usually stored browser cache therefore used multiple pages without reloaded reducing data transfer network
page reformatting

main article progressive enhancement

simple change line different style sheet used page advantages accessibility well providing ability tailor page site different target devices furthermore devices able understand styling still display content
accessibility
without designers must typically pages techniques html tables hinder accessibility visionimpaired users tableless designaccessibility

standardizationedit
frameworksedit
main article framework
frameworks preprepared libraries meant allow easier standardscompliant styling pages using cascading style sheets language frameworks include foundation blueprint bootstrap cascade framework materialize like programming scripting language libraries frameworks usually incorporated external sheets referenced html head provide number readymade options designing laying page although many frameworks published authors mostly rapid prototyping learning prefer handcraft appropriate published site without design maintenance download overhead many unused features sites styling73
