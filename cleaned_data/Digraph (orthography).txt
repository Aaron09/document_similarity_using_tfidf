double lettersedit
digraphs consist different characters heterogeneous digraphs instances character homogeneous digraphs latter case generally called double doubled letters
doubled vowel letters commonly used indicate long vowel sound case finnish estonian instance ⟨uu⟩ represents longer version vowel denoted ⟨ää⟩ represents longer version vowel denoted middle english sequences ⟨ee⟩ ⟨oo⟩ used similar represent lengthened sounds respectively spellings retained modern english orthography great vowel shift historical sound changes mean modern pronunciations quite different original ones
doubled consonant letters also used indicate long geminated consonant sound italian example consonants written double pronounced longer single ones original meaning doubled consonants english middle english early modern english period phonemic consonant length lost spelling convention developed doubled consonant serves indicated preceding vowel pronounced short modern english example ⟨pp⟩ tapping differentiates first vowel sound taping rare cases doubled consonant letters represent true geminate consonant modern english occur instances consonant come different morphemes example ⟨nn⟩ unnatural unnatural
cases sound represented doubled consonant letter distinguished length sound corresponding single consonant letter
