binomial nomenclature also called binominal nomenclature binary nomenclature formal system naming species living things giving name composed parts latin grammatical forms although based words languages name called binomial name shortened binomial binomen binominal name scientific name informally also called latin name first part name identifies genus species belongs second part specific name specific epithet identifies species within genus example humans belong genus homo within genus species homo sapiens formal introduction system naming species credited carl linnaeus effectively beginning work species plantarum 17531 gaspard bauhin early 1623 introduced book pinax theatri botanici english illustrated exposition plants many names genera later adopted linnaeus2
application binomial nomenclature governed various internationally agreed codes rules important international code zoological nomenclature iczn animals international code nomenclature algae fungi plants although general principles underlying binomial nomenclature common codes differences terminology precise rules
modern usage first letter first part name genus always capitalized writing second part even derived proper noun name person place similarly parts italicized binomial name occurs normal text underlined handwriting thus binomial name annual phlox named botanist thomas drummond written phlox drummondii

carl linnaeus 1707–1778 swedish botanist invented modern system binomial nomenclature


prior adoption modern binomial system naming species scientific name consisted generic name combined specific name several words long together formed system polynomial nomenclature3 names separate functions first designate label species second diagnosis description however goals eventually found incompatible4 simple genus containing species easy tell apart oneword genus oneword specific name species discovered names necessarily became longer unwieldy instance plantago foliis ovatolanceolatus pubescentibus spica cylindrica scapo tereti plantain pubescent ovatelanceolate leaves cylindric spike terete scape know today plantago media
polynomial names sometimes look like binomials significantly different example gerards herbal amended johnson describes various kinds spiderwort first called phalangium ramosum branched spiderwort second phalangium ramosum unbranched spiderwort aptly termed phalangium ephemerum virginianum soonfading spiderwort virginia5 latin phrases short descriptions rather identifying labels
bauhins particular caspar bauhin 1560–1624 took important steps towards binomial system pruning latin descriptions many cases words6 adoption biologists system strictly binomial nomenclature swedish botanist physician carl linné commonly known latinized name carl linnaeus 1707–1778 1753 species plantarum first began consistently using oneword trivial name together generic name system binomial nomenclature7 trivial name known specific epithet specific name iczn7 bauhins genus names retained many descriptive part reduced single word
linnaeuss trivial names introduced important idea namely function name could simply give species unique label meant name longer need descriptive example parts could derived names people thus gerards phalangium ephemerum virginianum became tradescantia virginiana genus name honoured john tradescant youngernote english botanist gardener8 bird parrot family named psittacus alexandri meaning alexanders parrot alexander great whose armies introduced eastern parakeets greece9 linnaeus trivial names much easier remember parallel polynomial names eventually replaced them1
valueedit
value binomial nomenclature system derives primarily economy widespread uniqueness stability names generally favors

economy compared polynomial system replaced binomial name shorter easier remember1 corresponds widespread system family name plus given names used name people many cultures6
widespread binomial system nomenclature governed international codes used biologists worldwide10 binomials also entered common speech homo sapiens coli tyrannosaurus
uniqueness provided taxonomists agree limits species name correct appropriate nomenclature code generally earliest published names accidentally assigned species11 however establishing names actually refer species determining priority difficult particularly species named biologists different countries therefore species regularly used name names synonyms12
stability although stability absolute procedures associated establishing binomial names principle priority tend favor stability13 example species transferred genera uncommonly happens result knowledge possible second part binomial kept thus disagreement among botanists whether genera chionodoxa scilla sufficiently different kept separate keep separate give plant commonly grown gardens europe name chionodoxa siehei give name scilla siehei14 siehei element constant similarly previously thought distinct species demoted lower rank subspecies possible second part binomial name retained third part name thus tenerife robin treated different species european robin case name erithacus superbus subspecies case name erithacus rubecula superbus15 superbus element name constant

problemsedit
binomial nomenclature species effect species moved genus another sometimes specific name epithet must changed well happen specific name already used genus agree gender genus biologists argued combination genus name specific epithet single unambiguous name uninomials used nomenclature ranks species16
binomials unique within kingdom possible species share binomial occur different kingdoms least five instances binomial duplication occur17
relationship classification taxonomyedit
nomenclature including binomial nomenclature classification although related classification ordering items groups based similarities differences biological classification species kinds item classified18 principle names given species could completely independent classification case binomial names since first part binomial name genus species placed rank genus binomial nomenclature classification partly independent example species retains binomial name moved family another order another unless better fits different genus different family split genus placed newly created genus independence partial since names families higher taxa usually based generacitation needed
taxonomy includes nomenclature classification first stages sometimes called alpha taxonomy concerned finding describing naming species living fossil organisms19 binomial nomenclature thus important part taxonomy system species named taxonomists also concerned classification including principles procedures rules20
derivation binomial namesedit
also list latin greek words commonly used systematic names
complete binomial name always treated grammatically phrase latin language hence common term latin name binomial name however parts binomial name derived number sources latin include

latin either classical medieval thus parts binomial name homo sapiens latin words meaning wise sapiens humanman homo
classical greek genus rhododendron named linnaeus greek word ῥοδόδενδρον derived rhodon rose dendron tree2122 greek words often converted latinized form thus coca plant cocaine obtained name erythroxylum coca erythroxylum derived greek words erythros xylon wood23 greek neuter ending often converted latin neuter ending umnote
languages second part name erythroxylum coca derived kuka name plant aymara quechua2425 since many dinosaur fossils found mongolia names often mongolian words tarchia tarkhi meaning brain saichania meaning beautiful
names people often naturalists biologists name magnolia campbellii commemorates people pierre magnol french botanist archibald campbell doctor british india26
names places lone star tick amblyomma americanum widespread united states27
sources binominal names constructed anagrams reorderings existing names thus name genus muilla derived reversing name allium28 names also derived jokes puns example ratcliffe described number species rhinoceros beetle including cyclocephala nodanotherwon29

first part name identifies genus must word treated latin singular noun nominative case must unique within kingdom repeated kingdoms thus huia recurvata extinct species plant found fossils yunnan china30 whereas huia masonii species frog found java indonesia31
second part name identifies species within genus also treated grammatically latin word number forms

second part binomial adjective adjective must agree genus name gender latin three genders masculine feminine neuter shown varying endings nouns adjectives house sparrow binomial name passer domesticus domesticus domestic simply means associated house sacred bamboo nandina domestica32 rather nandina domesticus since nandina feminine whereas passer masculine tropical fruit langsat product plant lansium parasiticum since lansium neuter common endings latin adjectives three genders masculine feminine neuter previous example domesticus tristis meaning minor meaning smaller information latin declension adjectives
second part binomial noun nominative case example binomial name lion panthera grammatically noun said apposition genus name nouns agree gender case panthera feminine masculine
second part binomial noun genitive possessive case genitive case constructed number ways latin depending declension noun common endings masculine neuter nouns singular orum plural feminine nouns singular arum plural noun part persons name often surname tibetan antelope pantholops hodgsonii shrub magnolia hodgsonii olivebacked pipit anthus hodgsoni meaning person named magnolia hodgsonii means hodgsons magnolia endings show case hodgson hodgson woman hodgsonae would used person commemorated binomial name usually ever person created name example anthus hodgsoni named charles wallace richmond honour hodgson rather person noun related place latimeria chalumnae meaning chalumna river another genitive nouns example name bacterium escherichia coli coli means colon formation common parasites xenos vesparum vesparum means wasps since xenos vesparum parasite wasps

whereas first part binomial name must unique within kingdom second part quite commonly used genera shown examples hodgsonii full binomial name must unique within kingdom
codesedit
early 19th century onwards became ever apparent body rules necessary govern scientific names course time became nomenclature codes international code zoological nomenclature iczn governs naming animals33 international code nomenclature algae fungi plants plants including cyanobacteria international code nomenclature bacteria icnb bacteria including archaea virus names governed international committee taxonomy viruses ictv taxonomic code determines taxa well names codes differ certain ways

binomial nomenclature correct term botany34 although also used zoologists35 since 1953 binominal nomenclature technically correct term zoology binominal name also called binomen plural binomina36
codes consider first part twopart name species generic name zoological code iczn second part name specific name botanical code specific epithet together parts referred species name binomen zoological code species name binomial binary combination botanical code species name term common codes
plant code allow parts binomial name name called tautonym whereas iczn animal code thus american bison binomial bison bison name kind would allowed plant
starting points time codes effect retroactively vary group group botany starting point often 1753 year carl linnaeus first published species plantarum zoology starting point 1758 january 1758 considered date publication linnaeuss systema naturae 10th edition also clercks aranei svecici bacteriology started anew starting point january 198037

writing binomial namesedit
tradition binomial names species usually typeset italics example homo sapiens38 generally binomial printed font style different used normal text example several homo sapiens fossils discovered handwritten binomial name underlined example homo sapiens39
first part binomial genus name always written initial capital letter current usage second part never written initial capital4041 older sources particularly botanical works published 1950s different convention second part name derived proper noun name person place capital letter used thus modern form berberis darwinii written berberis darwinii capital also used name formed nouns apposition panthera centaurea cyanus42note
used common name scientific name often follows parentheses although varies publication43 example house sparrow passer domesticus decreasing europe
binomial name generally written full exception several species genus listed discussed paper report species mentioned repeatedly case genus written full first used abbreviated initial periodfull stop44 example list members genus canis might written canis lupus aureus simensis rare cases abbreviated form spread general example bacterium escherichia coli often referred coli tyrannosaurus perhaps even better known simply often appearing form popular writing even full genus name already given
abbreviation used actual specific name cannot need specified abbreviation plural indicates several species abbreviations italicised underlined45 example canis means unspecified species genus canis canis means species genus canis abbreviations easily confused abbreviations zoology subsp botany plurals sspp subspp referring subspecies trinomen zoology infraspecific name
abbreviation confer latin used compare individualstaxa knowndescribed species conventions qualifier vary46 paleontology typically used identification confirmed47 example corvus nasicus used indicate fossil bird similar cuban crow certainly identified species48 molecular systematics papers used indicate undescribed species assumed related described species example paper describing phylogeny small benthic freshwater fish called darters five undescribed putative species ozark sheltowee wildcat ihiyo mamequit darters notable brightly colored nuptial males distinctive color patterns49 referred etheostoma spectabile viewed related distinct etheostoma spectabile orangethroat darter50 view supported varying degrees analysis somewhat informal taxa names qualifying abbreviations referred open nomenclature subject strict usage codes
contexts dagger symbol used binomial name indicate species extinct
authorityedit
main articles author citation zoology author citation botany

original name changed species moved different genus codes parentheses around original authority also requires person made change given examples

plant amaranthus retroflexus standard abbreviation linnaeus absence parentheses shows original name
plant hyacinthoides italica rothm linnaeus first named italian bluebell scilla italica rothmaler transferred genus hyacinthoides
animal passer domesticus linnaeus 1758 original name given linnaeus fringilla domestica unlike iczn require name person changed genus given
