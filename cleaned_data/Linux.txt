linus torvalds principal author linux kernel


unix operating system conceived implemented 1969 atts bell laboratories united states thompson dennis ritchie douglas mcilroy ossanna31 first released 1971 unix written entirely assembly language common practice time later pioneering approach 1973 rewritten programming language dennis ritchie exception hardware routines availability highlevel language implementation unix made porting different computer platforms easier32
earlier antitrust case forbidding entering computer business required license operating systems source code anyone asked33 result unix grew quickly became widely adopted academic institutions businesses 1984 divested bell labs freed legal obligation requiring free licensing bell labs began selling unix proprietary product users werent legally allowed modify unix project started 1983 richard stallman goal creating complete unixcompatible software system composed entirely free software work began 198434 later 1985 stallman started free software foundation wrote general public license 1989 early 1990s many programs required operating system libraries compilers text editors unix shell windowing system completed although lowlevel elements device drivers daemons kernel called gnuhurd stalled incomplete35
linus torvalds stated kernel available time 1991 would decided write own36
although released 1992 legal complications development 386bsd netbsd openbsd freebsd descended predated linux torvalds also stated 386bsd available time probably would created linux37
minix created andrew tanenbaum computer science professor released 1987 minimal unixlike operating system targeted students others wanted learn operating system principles although complete source code minix freely available licensing terms prevented free software licensing changed april 200038
creationedit
1991 attending university helsinki torvalds became curious operating systems39 frustrated licensing minix time limited educational only38 began work operating system kernel eventually became linux kernel
torvalds began development linux kernel minix applications written minix also used linux later linux matured linux kernel development took place linux systems40 applications also replaced minix components advantageous freely available code project fledgling operating system code licensed reused computer programs long also released compatible license torvalds initiated switch original license prohibited commercial redistribution gpl41 developers worked integrate components linux kernel making fully functional free operating system42
