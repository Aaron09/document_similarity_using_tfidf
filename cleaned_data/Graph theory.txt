definitionsedit
definitions graph theory vary following basic ways defining graphs related mathematical structures
graphedit
common sense term1 graph ordered pair comprising vertices nodes points together edges arcs lines 2element subsets edge associated vertices association takes form unordered pair comprising vertices avoid ambiguity type graph described precisely undirected simple
senses graph stem different conceptions edge generalized notion2 together relation incidence associates edge vertices another generalized notion multiset unordered pairs necessarily distinct vertices many authors call type object multigraph pseudograph
variants others described fully
vertices belonging edge called ends vertices edge vertex exist graph belong edge
usually taken finite many wellknown results true rather different infinite graphs many arguments fail infinite case order graph number vertices size graph number edges degree valency vertex number edges connect edge connects vertex loop counted twice
edge graph theorists usually somewhat shorter notation

graph theory sociology moreno sociogram 19539


graph theory also widely used sociology example measure actors prestige explore rumor spreading notably social network analysis software umbrella social networks many different types graphs10 acquaintanceship friendship graphs describe whether people know influence graphs model whether certain people influence behavior others finally collaboration graphs model whether people work together particular acting movie together
likewise graph theory useful biology conservation efforts vertex represent regions certain species exist inhabit edges represent migration paths movement regions information important looking breeding patterns tracking spread disease parasites changes movement affect species
mathematics graphs useful geometry certain parts topology knot theory algebraic graph theory close links group theory
graph structure extended assigning weight edge graph graphs weights weighted graphs used represent structures pairwise connections numerical values example graph represents road network weights could represent length road several weights associated edge including distance previous example travel time monetary cost weighted graphs commonly used program gpss travelplanning search engines compare flight times costs
