john stuart mill believed restraint trade doctrine justified preserve liberty competition


classical perspective competition certain agreements business practice could unreasonable restraint individual liberty tradespeople carry livelihoods restraints judged permissible courts cases appeared light changing business circumstances hence courts found specific categories agreement specific clauses fall foul doctrine economic fairness contrive overarching conception market power earlier theorists like adam smith rejected monopoly power basis

monopoly granted either individual trading company effect secret trade manufactures monopolists keeping market constantly understocked never fully supplying effectual demand sell commodities much natural price raise emoluments whether consist wages profit greatly natural rate54

wealth nations 1776 adam smith also pointed cartel problem advocate specific legal measures combat

people trade seldom meet together even merriment diversion conversation ends conspiracy public contrivance raise prices impossible indeed prevent meetings either could executed would consistent liberty justice though cannot hinder people trade sometimes assembling together ought nothing facilitate assemblies much less render necessary55

latter half 19th century become clear large firms become fact market economy john stuart mills approach laid treatise liberty 1859

trade social whoever undertakes sell description goods public affects interest persons society general thus conduct principle comes within jurisdiction society cheapness good quality commodities effectually provided leaving producers sellers perfectly free sole check equal freedom buyers supplying elsewhere socalled doctrine free trade rests grounds different though equally solid principle individual liberty asserted essay restrictions trade production purposes trade indeed restraints restraint restraint evil56

merger acquisition involves competition perspective concentration economic power hands fewer before85 usually means firm buys shares another reasons oversight economic concentrations state reasons restrict firms abuse position dominance regulation mergers acquisitions attempts deal problem arises ante prevention market dominance86 united states merger regulation began clayton european union merger regulation 1392004 known ecmr87 competition requires firms proposing merge gain authorization relevant government authority theory behind mergers transaction costs reduced compared operating open market bilateral contracts88 concentrations increase economies scale scope however often firms take advantage increase market power increased market share decreased number competitors adversely affect deal consumers merger control predicting market might like knowing making judgment hence central provision asks whether concentration would went ahead significantly impede effective competition particular result creation strengthening dominant position89 corresponding provision antitrust states similarly

intellectual property innovation competitionedit
competition become increasingly intertwined intellectual property copyright trademarks patents industrial design rights jurisdictions trade secrets100 believed promotion innovation enforcement intellectual property rights promote well limit competitiveness question rests whether legal acquire monopoly accumulation intellectual property rights case judgment needs decide giving preference intellectual property rights towards promoting competitiveness

antitrust laws accord special treatment intellectual property
intellectual rights revoked granted antitrust laws violated

concerns also arise anticompetitive effects consequences

intellectual properties collaboratively designed consequence violating antitrust laws intentionally otherwise
effects competition properties accepted industry standards
crosslicensing intellectual property
bundling intellectual property rights long term business transactions agreements extend market exclusiveness intellectual property rights beyond statutory duration
trade secrets remain secret eternal length life
