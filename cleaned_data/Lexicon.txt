size organizationedit
items lexicon called lexemes lexical items word forms lexemes atomic elements contain phonological morphological components describing lexicon reductionist approach used trying remain general using minimal description describe size lexicon lexemes grouped lemmas lemma group lexemes generated inflectional morphology lemmas represented dictionaries headwords list citation forms irregular forms since must learned words correctly lexemes derived word derivational morphology considered lemmas lexicon also organized according open closed categories closed categories determiners pronouns rarely given lexemes function primarily syntactic open categories nouns verbs highly active generation mechanisms lexemes semantic nature
lexicalization mechanisms lexiconedit
central role lexicon documenting established lexical norms conventions lexicalization process words gained widespread usage enter lexicon since lexicalization3 modify lexemes phonologically morphologically possible single etymological source inserted single lexicon forms pairs called doublet often close semantically examples aptitude versus attitude employ versus imply4
mechanisms mutually exclusive are5

innovation6 planned creation roots often largescale slang branding
borrowing foreign words
compounding composition combination lexemes make single word
abbreviation compounds
acronyms reduction compounds initial letters nasa laser laser
inflection morphology change category number tense
derivation morphological change resulting change category
agglutination compounding morphemes single word

neologisms wordsedit
neologisms lexeme candidates gain wide usage time become part languages lexicon neologisms often introduced children produce erroneous forms mistake7 another common source slang activities advertising branding
neologisms maintain sound external sourceedit
types borrowings neologisms based external sources retain sound source language material

borrowing using source language lexical item basic material neologization guestwords foreignisms loanwords
borrowing using target language lexical items basic material neologization phonosemantic matching semanticized phonetic matching phonetic matching

guestwords foreignisms loanwordsedit
following examples external lexical expansion using source language lexical item basic material neologization listed decreasing order phonetic resemblance original lexical item source language8

guestword german gastwort unassimilated borrowing
foreignism german fremdwort foreign word phonetic adaptation
loanword german lehnwort totally assimilated borrowing morphemic adaptation

phonosemantic matches semanticized phonetic matches phonetic matchesedit
following examples simultaneous external internal lexical expansion using target language lexical items basic material neologization still resembling sound lexical item source language9

phonosemantic matching target language material originally similar source language lexical item phonetically semantically
semanticized phonetic matching target language material originally similar source language lexical item phonetically loose semantically
phonetic matching target language material originally similar source language lexical item phonetically semantically

role morphologyedit
another mechanism involves generative devices combine morphemes according languages rules example suffix able usually added transitive verbs readable cryable
compoundingedit
compound word lexeme composed several preexisting morphemes compound word composed established lexeme usually easier acquire loan words neologisms meaning usually constituent parts meaning armed dangerous example derives parts armed teeth involves metaphor
compound words semantical constituents interpreted analogy common sense context3 compound words simple morphological structures element usually requires inflection agreement hand subject rules syntax contain gaps hold lexemes operate instance

another nail somethingsomeone another nail companys coffin
bring something someones attention bring problem attention

compounds successfully established language often cross geographical boundaries

house–wife becoming housewife
város–háza city–hall hungarian becoming városháza
rot–licht red–light german becoming rotlicht

compounding tends produce longer lexemes result lexemes unwieldy proportion compensated mechanisms reduce length words similar phenomenon recently shown feature social media also hashtags compound form longersized hashtags times popular individual constituent hashtags forming compound10
diachronic mechanismsedit
comparative historical linguistics studies evolutions languages takes diachronic view lexicon evolution lexicons different languages occurs parallel mechanism time historical forces work shape lexicon11 making simpler acquire often creating illusion great regularity language

phonological assimilation modification loanwords languages sound structure effectively however loanword sounds foreign inflection derivation rules able transform
analogy words undergo inflection derivation analogous words similar sound structure
emphasis modification words stress accenting
metaphor form semantic extension

secondlanguage lexiconedit
main article bilingual lexical access
term lexicon generally used context single language therefore multilingual speakers generally thought multiple lexicons speakers language variants brazilian portuguese european portuguese example considered possess single lexicon thus cash dispenser british english well automatic teller machine american english would understood american british speakers despite group using different dialects
linguists study lexicon consider things constitutes word wordconcept relationship lexical access lexical access failure words phonology syntax meaning intersect morphologyword relationship vocabulary structure within given language language pragmatics language acquisition history evolution words etymology relationships words often studied within philosophy language
various models lexicons organized words retrieved proposed psycholinguistics neurolinguistics computational linguistics
