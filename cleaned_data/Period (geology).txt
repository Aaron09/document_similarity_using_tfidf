correlation issuesedit
steady effort ongoing since 1974 international commission stratigraphy working correlate worlds local stratigraphic record uniform planetwide benchmarked system
american geologists long considered mississippian pennsylvanian periods right though recognises subperiods carboniferous period recognised european geologists cases like china russia even zealand geological eras slowed uniform organization stratigraphic record
notable changes

changes recent years included abandonment former tertiary period favour paleogene succeeding neogene periods
abandonment quaternary period also considered retained continuity reasons
even earlier history science tertiary considered subdivisions paleocene eocene oligocene miocene pliocene referred periods enjoy status epochs within recently delineated paleogene neogene periods
