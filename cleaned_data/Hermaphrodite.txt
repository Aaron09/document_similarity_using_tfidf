clownfish initially male largest fish group becomes female






species parrotfish start life females later change males


sequential hermaphrodites dichogamy occur species individual born later change opposite sex12 contrasts simultaneous hermaphrodites individual possess fully functional male female genitalia sequential hermaphroditism common fish particularly teleost fish jellyfish many gastropods common slipper shell flowering plants sequential hermaphrodites change once13 sequential hermaphroditism best understood terms behavioral ecology evolutionary life history theory described sizeadvantage mode14 first proposed michael ghiselin15 states individual certain could significantly increase reproductive success reaching certain size would advantage switch
sequential hermaphrodites divided three broad categories

protandry organism born male changes female12

example clownfish genus amphiprion colorful reef fish found living symbiosis anemones generally anemone contains harem consisting large female smaller reproductive male even smaller nonreproductive males female removed reproductive male change largest nonreproductive males mature become reproductive shown fishing pressure change switch male female occurs since fishermen usually prefer catch larger fish populations generally changing smaller size natural selection


protogyny organism born female changes male12

example wrasses family labridae group reef fish protogyny common wrasses also uncommon life history strategy termed diandry literally males species male morphs exists initial phase male terminal phase male initial phase males look like males spawn groups females territorial perhaps female mimics found swimming group females terminal phase males territorial distinctively bright coloration individuals born males females born males born terminal phase males females initial phase males become terminal phase males usually dominant female initial phase male replaces terminal phase male males abandon group


bidirectional changers organism female male reproductive organs either female male different stages life12

example lythrypnus dalli family lythrypnus group coral reef fish bidirectional change occurs social hierarchy established fish changes according social status regardless initial based simple principle fish expresses subordinate behavior changes female fish expresses dominant subordinate behavior fish changes male16



dichogamy conservationrelated implications humans mentioned well economic implications instance groupers favoured fish eating many asian countries often aquacultured since adults take several years change female male broodstock extremely valuable individuals
simultaneous hermaphroditesedit

earthworms simultaneous hermaphrodites male female reproductive organs


simultaneous synchronous hermaphrodite homogamous adult organism male female sexual organs time12 selffertilization often occurs

reproductive system gastropods pulmonate land snails land slugs perhaps bestknown kind simultaneous hermaphrodite widespread terrestrial animals possessing sexual polymorphism sexual material exchanged animals spermatophore stored spermatheca exchange spermatozoa animals fertilized eggs period gestation eggs proceed hatch development period snails typically reproduce early spring late autumn
banana slugs example hermaphroditic gastropod mating partner desirable biologically genetic material resultant offspring varied mating partner possible selffertilization practiced male sexual organ adult banana slug quite large proportion size well compared female organ possible banana slugs mating become stuck together substantial amount wiggling fails separate male organ bitten using slugs radula apophallation banana slug lost male sexual organ still mate female making hermaphroditic quality valuable adaptation
hamlets unlike fish seem quite ease mating front divers allowing observations wild occur readily practice selffertilization find mate pair takes turns acts male acts female multiple matings usually course several nights
earthworms another example simultaneous hermaphrodite although possess ovaries testes protective mechanism selffertilization sexual reproduction occurs worms meet exchange gametes copulating damp nights warm seasons fertilized eggs protected cocoon buried near surface ground
freeliving hermaphroditic nematode caenorhabditis elegans reproduces primarily selffertilization infrequent outcrossing events occur rate approximately
mangrove killifish kryptolebias marmoratus species fish lives along east coast north central south america fish simultaneous hermaphrodites marmoratus produces eggs sperm meiosis routinely reproduces selffertilization individual hermaphrodite normally fertilizes sperm produced internal organ unite inside fish’s body18
