importance placed bullion also central target even many mercantilists begun deemphasize importance gold silver adam smith noted core mercantile system popular folly confusing wealth money bullion commodity reason give special treatment8 recently scholars discounted accuracy critique believe misselden making mistake 1620s point followers josiah child charles davenant 1699 wrote gold silver indeed measure trade spring original nations natural artificial product country land labour industry produces38 critique mercantilism form rent seeking also seen criticism scholars jacob viner 1930s pointed merchant mercantilists understood would gain higher prices english wares abroad39
first school completely reject mercantilism physiocrats developed theories france theories also several important problems replacement mercantilism come adam smith published wealth nations 1776 book outlines basics today known classical economics smith spent considerable portion book rebutting arguments mercantilists though often simplified exaggerated versions mercantilist thought31
scholars also divided cause mercantilisms believe theory simply error hold replacement inevitable soon smiths accurate ideas unveiled feel mercantilism amounted rent seeking hold ended major power shifts occurred britain mercantilism faded parliament gained monarchs power grant monopolies wealthy capitalists controlled house commons benefited monopolies parliament found difficult implement high cost group decision making40
mercantilist regulations steadily removed course 18th century britain 19th century british government fully embraced free trade smiths laissezfaire economics continent process somewhat different france economic control remained hands royal family mercantilism continued french revolution germany mercantilism remained important ideology 19th early 20th centuries historical school economics paramount41

keynes economists 20th century also realized balance payments important concern keynes also supported government intervention economy necessity mercantilism44
2010update word mercantilism remains pejorative term often used attack various forms protectionism45 similarities keynesianism successor ideas mercantilism sometimes critics call neomercantilism paul samuelson writing within keynesian framework wrote mercantilism employment less full national product suboptimal debunked mercantilist arguments turn valid46
systems copy several mercantilist policies japans economic system also sometimes called neomercantilist47 essay appearing 2007 issue newsweek business columnist robert samuelson wrote china pursuing essentially neomercantilist trade policy threatened undermine post–world international economic structure48
murray rothbard representing austrian school economics describes
