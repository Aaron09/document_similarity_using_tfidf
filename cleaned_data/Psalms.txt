editorial agendaedit
many scholars believe individual psalms redacted single collection secondtemple times long recognized collection bore imprint underlying message metanarrative message remained concealed augustine hippo said sequence psalms seems contain secret mighty mystery meaning revealed enarr 1501 others pointed presence concatenation adjacent psalms sharing similar words themes time approach developed recognizing overarching themes shared whole groups psalms22
1985 gerald wilsons editing hebrew psalter proposed parallel ancient eastern hymn collections psalms beginning seams five books psalms thematic significance corresponding particular placement royal psalms pointed progression ideas adversity crux collection apparent failure covenant psalm leading concert praise concluded collection redacted retrospective failure davidic covenant exhorting israel trust alone nonmessianic future23 walter brueggemann suggested underlying editorial purpose oriented rather towards wisdom sapiential concerns addressing issues live life faith psalm calls reader life obedience psalm brueggemanns crux psalm faces crisis divine faithfulness doubt psalm represents faiths triumph praised rewards being24 1997 david mitchells message psalter took quite different line building work wilson others25 mitchell proposed psalter embodies eschatological timetable like zechariah 9–1426 programme includes gathering exiled israel bridegroomking establishment kingdom violent death israel scattered wilderness regathered imperilled rescued king heavens establishes kingdom zion brings peace prosperity earth receives homage nations timetable confirmed parallels baal cycle romanperiod midrashim
three views—wilsons nonmessianic retrospective davidic covenant brueggemanns sapiential instruction mitchells eschatologicomessianic programme—all followers although sapiential agenda somewhat eclipsed shortly untimely death 2005 wilson modified position allow existence messianic prophecy within psalms redactional agenda27 mitchells position remains largely unchanged although sees issue identifying historical beginning psalms turns eschatology28
