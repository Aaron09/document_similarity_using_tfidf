apparent mean solar timeedit
besides hours seconds word used several different spans time based rotation earth around axis important solar defined time takes return culmination point highest point earth orbits elliptically earth spins inclined axis period seconds less hours average year equivalent hours seconds
ancient custom start either rising setting local horizon italian reckoning example hours sunset oldstyle6 exact moment interval sunrises sunsets depends geographical position longitude well latitude time year indicated ancient hemispherical sundials
constant defined passing local meridian happens local noon upper culmination midnight lower culmination exact moment dependent geographical longitude lesser extent time year length nearly constant hours seconds time indicated modern sundials
improvement defines fictitious mean moves constant speed along celestial equator speed average speed real removes variation year earth moves along orbit around velocity axial tilt
daytimeedit
sense daytime distinguished nighttime commonly defined period sunlight directly reaches ground assuming local obstacles length daytime averages slightly half 24hour effects make daytime average longer nights point apparent size minutes additionally atmosphere refracts sunlight reaches ground even horizon minutes first light reaches ground centre still horizon minutes difference time depends angle rises sets function latitude amount around minutes

decimal metric timeedit

19th century idea circulated make decimal fraction ​1⁄10 ​1⁄100 astronomical base unit time afterglow shortlived movement toward decimalisation timekeeping calendar given already difficulty transitioning traditional familiar units successful alternative centiday equal minutes seconds shorter multiple hour also closer multiple kilosecond seconds equal traditional chinese unit
colloquialedit
