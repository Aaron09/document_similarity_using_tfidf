army army group region theatre large formations vary significantly armed forces size hierarchy position divisions traditional level support elements field artillery hospital logistics maintenance added unit structure since world many brigades support units since 1980s regiments also receiving support elements regiment support elements called regimental combat team military parlance battle group forces
world army used basic organizational structure however beginning many units greatly underpowered size actually level ladder usually used elsewhere example division earlywwii army would size nations regiments brigades56 ladder nations would call army group army called front contrast period german wehrmacht army groups particularly eastern front army group centre significantly exceeded numbers cognate soviet strategic directions
naval hierarchyedit
naval organization flotilla level higher less commonly abided ships operate smaller larger groups various situations change moments notice however common terminology used throughout navies communicate general concept many vessels might unit
navies generally organized groups specific purpose usually strategic organizational groupings appear disappear frequently based conditions demands placed upon navy contrasts army organization units remain static equipment long periods time

additionally naval organization continues aboard single ship complement forms three four departments tactical engineering number divisions followed work centers
