mathematically rigorous formulation quantum mechanics developed paul dirac22 david hilbert23 john neumann24 hermann weyl25 possible states quantum mechanical system symbolized26 unit vectors called state vectors formally reside complex separable hilbert space—variously called state space associated hilbert space system—that well defined complex number norm phase factor words possible states points projective space hilbert space usually called complex projective space exact nature hilbert space dependent system—for example state space position momentum states space squareintegrable functions state space spin single proton product complex planes observable represented maximally hermitian precisely selfadjoint linear operator acting state space eigenstate observable corresponds eigenvector operator associated eigenvalue corresponds value observable eigenstate operators spectrum discrete observable attain discrete eigenvalues
formalism quantum mechanics state system given time described complex wave function also referred state vector complex vector space27 abstract mathematical object allows calculation probabilities outcomes concrete experiments example allows compute probability finding electron particular region around nucleus particular time contrary classical mechanics never make simultaneous predictions conjugate variables position momentum arbitrary precision instance electrons considered certain probability located somewhere within given region space exact positions unknown contours constant probability often referred clouds drawn around nucleus atom conceptualize electron might located probability heisenbergs uncertainty principle quantifies inability precisely locate particle given conjugate momentum28
according interpretation result measurement wave function containing probability information system collapses given initial state particular eigenstate possible results measurement eigenvalues operator representing observable—which explains choice hermitian operators eigenvalues real probability distribution observable given state found computing spectral decomposition corresponding operator heisenbergs uncertainty principle represented statement operators corresponding certain observables commute
