raster graphics resolution dependent meaning cannot scale arbitrary resolution without loss apparent quality property contrasts capabilities vector graphics easily scale quality device rendering raster graphics deal practically vector graphics photographs photorealistic images vector graphics often serve better typesetting graphic design modern computermonitors typically display pixels inch modern consumer printers resolve 2400 dots inch determining appropriate image resolution given printerresolution pose difficulties since printed output greater level detail viewer discern monitor typically resolution works well 4color process cmyk printing
however printing technologies perform color mixing dithering halftone rather overprinting virtually homeoffice inkjet laser printers printer image different meaning misleading dithering process printer builds single image pixel several printer dots increase color depth printers setting must higher desired ensure sufficient color depth without sacrificing image resolution thus instance printing image actually require printer setting 1200 dpi10
