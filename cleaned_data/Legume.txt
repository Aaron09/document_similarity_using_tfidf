terminologyedit
also bean terminology
term pulse used united nations food agriculture organization reserved crops harvested solely seed2 excludes green beans green peas considered vegetable crops also excluded seeds mainly grown extraction oilseeds like soybeans peanuts seeds used exclusively sowing forage clovers alfalfa however common usage distinctions always clearly made many varieties used dried pulses also used green vegetables beans pods young
fabaceae scotch broom genisteae leguminous usually called legumes farmers tend restrict term food crops
usesedit
farmed legumes belong many agricultural classes including forage grain blooms pharmaceuticalindustrial fallowgreen manure timber species commercially farmed species fill roles simultaneously depending upon degree maturity harvested
human consumptionedit




freshly peanuts arachis hypogaea indehiscent legume fruits


grain legumes cultivated seeds seeds used human animal consumption production oils industrial uses grain legumes include beans lentils lupins peas peanuts3
nutritional valueedit
legumes significant source protein dietary fiber carbohydrates dietary minerals example gram serving cooked chickpeas contains percent daily value protein percent dietary fiber percent folate percent manganese4 like plantbased foods pulses contain cholesterol little sodium4
legumes also excellent source resistant starch broken bacteria large intestine produce shortchain fatty acids butyrate used intestinal cells food energy5
preliminary studies humans include potential regular consumption legumes vegetarian diet affect metabolic syndrome6 evidence portion pulses roughly daily diet help lower blood pressure reduce cholesterol levels though concern quality supporting data78

legume species grown flowers include lupins farmed commercially blooms well popular gardens worldwidecitation needed industrially farmed legumes include indigofera acacia species cultivated natural production respectivelycitation needed fallowgreen manure legume species cultivated tilled back soil order exploit high levels captured atmospheric nitrogen found roots legumes numerous legumes farmed purpose include leucaena cyamopsis sesbania species various legume species farmed timber production worldwide including numerous acacia species castanospermum australecitation needed
legume trees like locust trees gleditsia robinia kentucky coffeetree gymnocladus dioicus used permaculture food forests legume trees like laburnum woody climbing vine wisteria poisonous
nitrogen fixationedit
main articles nitrogen fixation green manure




root nodules wisteria plant hazelnut pictured comparison


many legumes contain symbiotic bacteria called rhizobia within root nodules root systems plants belonging genus styphnolobium exception rule bacteria special ability fixing nitrogen atmospheric molecular nitrogen ammonia nh39 chemical reaction

2nh3

ammonia converted another form ammonium
usable plants following reaction




arrangement means root nodules sources nitrogen legumes making relatively rich plant proteins proteins contain nitrogenous amino acids nitrogen therefore necessary ingredient production proteins hence legumes among best sources plant protein
legume plant dies field example following harvest remaining nitrogen incorporated amino acids inside remaining plant parts released back soil soil amino acids converted nitrate
making nitrogen available plants thereby serving fertilizer future crops1011
many traditional organic farming practices crop rotation involving legumes common alternating legumes nonlegumes sometimes planting nonlegumes times legume field usually receives sufficient amount nitrogenous compounds produce good result even crop nonleguminous legumes sometimes referred green manure
historyedit

legumes widely distributed thirdlargest land plant family terms number species behind orchidaceae asteraceae genera 19000 known species1415 constituting seven percent flowering plant species1617
india worlds largest producer largest consumer pulses pakistan canada myanmar australia united states order significant exporters indias significant suppliers global pulse market estimated million tonnes13
