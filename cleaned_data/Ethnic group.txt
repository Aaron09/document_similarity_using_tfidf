approaches understanding ethnicityedit
different approaches understanding ethnicity used different social scientists trying understand nature ethnicity factor human life society examples approaches primordialism essentialism perennialism constructivism modernism instrumentalism

primordialism holds ethnicity existed times human history modern ethnic groups historical continuity past idea ethnicity closely linked idea nations rooted preweber understanding humanity divided primordially existing groups rooted kinship biological heritage

essentialist primordialism holds ethnicity priori fact human existence ethnicity precedes human social interaction basically unchanged theory sees ethnic groups natural historical also problems dealing consequences intermarriage migration colonization composition modern multiethnic societies30
kinship primordialism holds ethnic communities extensions kinship units basically derived kinship clan ties choices cultural signs language religion traditions made exactly show biological affinity myths common biological ancestry defining feature ethnic communities understood representing actual biological history problem view ethnicity often case mythic origins specific ethnic groups directly contradict known biological history ethnic community30
geertzs primordialism notably espoused anthropologist clifford geertz argues humans general attribute overwhelming power primordial human givens blood ties language territory cultural differences geertz opinion ethnicity primordial humans perceive embedded experience world30


perennialism approach primarily concerned nationhood tends nations ethnic communities basically phenomenon holds nation type social political organisation immemorial perennial character31 smith 1999 distinguishes variants continuous perennialism claims particular nations existed long spans time recurrent perennialism focuses emergence dissolution reappearance nations recurring aspect human history32

perpetual perennialism holds specific ethnic groups existed continuously throughout history
situational perennialism holds nations ethnic groups emerge change vanish course history view holds concept ethnicity basically tool used political groups manipulate resources wealth power territory status particular groups interests accordingly ethnicity emerges relevant means furthering emergent collective interests changes according political changes society examples perennialist interpretation ethnicity also found barth seidner ethnicity everchanging boundaries groups people established ongoing social negotiation interaction
instrumentalist perennialism seeing ethnicity primarily versatile tool identified different ethnics groups limits time explains ethnicity mechanism social stratification meaning ethnicity basis hierarchical arrangement individuals according donald noel sociologist developed theory origin ethnic stratification ethnic stratification system stratification wherein relatively fixed group membership race religion nationality utilized major criterion assigning social positions33 ethnic stratification many different types social stratification including stratification based socioeconomic status race gender according donald noel ethnic stratification emerge specific ethnic groups brought contact another groups characterized high degree ethnocentrism competition differential power ethnocentrism tendency look world primarily perspective ones culture downgrade groups outside ones culture sociologists lawrence bobo vincent hutchings origin ethnic stratification lies individual dispositions ethnic prejudice relates theory ethnocentrism34 continuing noels theory degree differential power must present emergence ethnic stratification words inequality power among ethnic groups means unequal power able impose upon another33 addition differential power degree competition structured along ethnic lines prerequisite ethnic stratification well different ethnic groups must competing common goal power influence material interest wealth territory lawrence bobo vincent hutchings propose competition driven selfinterest hostility results inevitable stratification conflict34


constructivism sees primordialist perennialist views basically flawed34 rejects notion ethnicity basic human condition holds ethnic groups products human social interaction maintained maintained valid social constructs societies

modernist constructivism correlates emergence ethnicity movement towards nation states beginning early modern period35 proponents theory eric hobsbawm argue ethnicity notions ethnic pride nationalism purely modern inventions appearing modern period world history hold prior ethnic homogeneity considered ideal necessary factor forging largescale societies

theory preceded century biological essentialism dominant paradigm race biological essentialism belief white european races biologically superior nonwhite races inherently inferior view arose justify slavery africans genocide native americans society supposedly founded freedom notion developed slowly came preoccupation scientists theologians public religious institutions asked questions whether multiple genesiss polygenesis whether created lesser races many foremost scientists time took idea racial difference would inadvertently find white europeans superior method used measurement cranial capacity43
ethnicity theory based assimilation model park outlined four steps assimilation contact conflict accommodation assimilation instead explaining marginalized status people color united states inherent biological inferiority instead said failure assimilate american culture held people back could equal long dropped culture deficient compared white culture
michael howard winants theory racial formation directly confronts ethnicity theorys premises practices argue racial formation united states ethnicity theory exclusively based immigration patterns white ethnic population account unique experiences nonwhites country44 theory identities different stages immigration process contact conflict struggle last best response assimilation white ethnic communities44 ethnicity paradigm neglects ways race complicate communitys interactions basic social political structures especially upon contact
assimilation shedding particular qualities native culture purpose blending host culture work groups response racism discrimination others44 moreover legal barriers achieving equality dismantled problem racism became sole responsibility already disadvantaged communities45 assumed black latino community making standards white ethnics community hold right values beliefs must stubbornly resisting dominant norms want winants critique ethnicity theory explains looking towards cultural defect source inequality ignores concrete sociopolitical dynamics within racial phenomena operate us46 words buying approach effectively strips ability critically examine structural components racism encourages instead “benign neglect” social inequality46
