geography climateedit
arctic region north arctic circle climate characterized cold winters cool summers precipitation mostly comes form snow arctic experiences days summer never sets days winter never rises duration phases varies locations right arctic circle several months near north pole middle northern hemisphere
arctic circle tropic cancer lies northern temperate zone changes regions summer winter generally mild rather extreme cold however temperate climate unpredictable weather
tropical regions tropic cancer equator generally year round tend experience rainy season summer months season winter months
northern hemisphere objects moving across surface earth tend turn right coriolis effect result largescale horizontal flows water tend form clockwiseturning gyres best seen ocean circulation patterns north atlantic north pacific oceans
reason flows toward northern surface earth tend spread across surface clockwise pattern thus clockwise circulation characteristic high pressure weather cells northern hemisphere conversely rising northern surface earth creating region pressure tends draw toward counterclockwise pattern hurricanes tropical storms massive lowpressure systems spin counterclockwise northern hemisphere
shadow sundial moves clockwise northern hemisphere opposite southern hemisphere tends rise maximum southerly position except tropic cancer equator seen north directly overhead south noon dependent time year
viewed northern hemisphere moon appears inverted compared view southern hemisphere34 north pole faces away galactic center milky results milky sparser dimmer northern hemisphere compared southern hemisphere making northern hemisphere suitable deepspace observation blinded milky waycitation needed
