lowergrade sources iron generally require beneficiation using techniques like crushing milling gravity heavy media separation screening silica froth flotation improve concentration remove impurities results high quality fine powders known fines
magnetiteedit
magnetite magnetic hence easily separated gangue minerals capable producing highgrade concentrate levels impurities
grain size magnetite degree commingling silica groundmass determine grind size rock must comminuted enable efficient magnetic separation provide high purity magnetite concentrate determines energy inputs required milling operation
mining banded iron formations involves coarse crushing screening followed rough crushing fine grinding comminute point crystallized magnetite quartz fine enough quartz left behind resultant powder passed magnetic separator

inclusion even small amounts elements profound effects behavioral characteristics batch iron operation smelter effects good catastrophically chemicals deliberately added flux makes blast furnace efficient others added make iron fluid harder give desirable quality choice fuel flux determine slag behaves operational characteristics iron produced ideally iron contains iron oxygen reality rarely case typically iron contains host elements often unwanted modern steel
siliconedit
silica
almost always present iron slagged smelting process temperatures 1300 reduced form alloy iron hotter furnace silicon present iron uncommon find european cast iron 16th 18th centuries
major effect silicon promote formation grey iron grey iron less brittle easier finish white iron preferred casting purposes reason turner 1900 192–197 reported silicon also reduces shrinkage formation blowholes lowering number castings
phosphorusedit
phosphorus four major effects iron increased hardness strength lower solidus temperature increased fluidity cold shortness depending intended iron effects either good often high phosphorus content gordon 1996
strength hardness iron increases concentration phosphorus phosphorus wrought iron makes hard medium carbon steel high phosphorus iron also hardened cold hammering hardening effect true concentration phosphorus phosphorus harder iron becomes hardened hammering modern steel makers increase hardness much without sacrificing shock resistance maintaining phosphorus levels also increases depth hardening quenching time also decreases solubility carbon iron high temperatures would decrease usefulness making blister steel cementation speed amount carbon absorption overriding consideration
addition phosphorus side concentrations higher iron becomes increasingly cold short brittle temperatures cold short especially important iron although iron usually worked uses often require tough bendable resistant shock room temperature nail shattered hammer carriage wheel broke rock would sell well high enough concentrations phosphorus render iron unusable rostoker bronson 1990 effects cold shortness magnified temperature thus piece iron perfectly serviceable summer might become extremely brittle winter evidence middle ages wealthy high phosphorus sword summer phosphorus sword winter rostoker bronson 1990
careful control phosphorus great benefit casting operations phosphorus depresses liquidus temperature allowing iron remain molten longer increases fluidity addition double distance molten iron flow rostoker bronson 1990 maximum effect achieved concentration rostocker bronson 1990 foundry work turner felt ideal iron 02–055 phosphorus resulting iron filled molds fewer voids also shrank less 19th century producers decorative cast iron used iron phosphorus extreme fluidity allowed make complex delicate castings could weight bearing strength turner 1900 202–204
remedies high phosphorus iron oldest easiest avoidance iron produced cold short would search source iron second method involves oxidizing phosphorus fining process adding iron oxide technique usually associated puddling 19th century understood earlier instance isaac zane owner marlboro iron works appear know 1772 given zanes reputation keeping abreast latest developments technique probably unknown ironmasters virginia pennsylvania
phosphorus deleterious contaminant makes steel brittle even concentrations little phosphorus cannot easily removed fluxing smelting iron ores must generally phosphorus begin
aluminiumedit
small amounts aluminium present many ores including iron sand limestones former removed washing prior smelting introduction brick lined furnaces amount aluminum contamination small enough effect either iron slag however brick began used hearths interior blast furnaces amount aluminium contamination increased dramatically erosion furnace lining liquid slag
aluminium hard reduce result aluminium contamination iron problem however increase viscosity slag kato minowa 1969 rosenqvist 1983 number adverse effects furnace operation thicker slag slow descent charge prolonging process high aluminium also make difficult liquid slag extreme could lead frozen furnace
number solutions high aluminium slag first avoidance dont lime source high aluminium content increasing ratio lime flux decrease viscosity rosenqvist 1983
sulfuredit
sulfur frequent contaminant coal also present small quantities many ores removed calcining sulfur dissolves readily liquid solid iron temperatures present iron smelting effects even small amounts sulfur immediate serious first worked iron makers sulfur causes iron short gordon 1996
short iron brittle serious problem iron used 17th 18th century wrought iron wrought iron shaped repeated blows hammer piece short iron crack worked hammer piece iron steel cracks exposed surface immediately oxidizes layer oxide prevents mending crack welding large cracks cause iron steel break smaller cracks cause object fail degree shortness direct proportion amount sulfur present today iron sulfur avoided
short iron worked worked temperatures working lower temperatures requires physical effort smith forgeman metal must struck often harder achieve result mildly sulfur contaminated worked requires great deal time effort
cast iron sulfur promotes formation white iron little counteract effects slow cooling high silicon content rostoker bronson 1990 white cast iron brittle also harder generally avoided difficult work except china high sulfur cast iron high made coal coke used make bells chimes rostoker bronson dvorak 1984 according turner 1900 good foundry iron less sulfur rest world high sulfur cast iron used making castings make poor wrought iron
number remedies sulfur contamination first used historic prehistoric operations avoidance coal used europe unlike china fuel smelting contains sulfur therefore causes short iron resulted short metal ironmasters looked another mineral coal first used european blast furnaces 1709 perhaps earlier coked introduction blast 1829 coal used
sulfur removed ores roasting washing roasting oxidizes sulfur form sulfur dioxide either escapes atmosphere washed warm climates possible leave pyritic rain combined action rain bacteria heat oxidize sulfides sulfates watersoluble turner 1900 however historically least iron sulfide iron pyrite
though common iron mineral used production iron metal natural weathering also used sweden process geological speed results gossan limonite ores
importance attached sulfur iron demonstrated consistently higher prices paid iron sweden russia spain 16th 18th centuries today sulfur longer problem modern remedy addition manganese operator must know much sulfur iron least five times much manganese must added neutralize historic irons display manganese levels well level needed neutralize sulfur rostoker bronson 1990
