british dominance early cableedit
1850s 1911 british submarine cable systems dominated important market north atlantic ocean british supply side demand side advantages terms supply britain entrepreneurs willing forth enormous amounts capital necessary build maintain cables terms demand britains vast colonial empire business cable companies news agencies trading shipping companies british government many britains colonies significant populations european settlers making news interest general public home country
british officials believed depending telegraph lines passed nonbritish territory posed security risk lines could messages could interrupted wartime sought creation worldwide network within empire became known line conversely prepared strategies quickly interrupt enemy communications11 britains first action declaring germany world cable ship alert telconia frequently reported12 five cables linking germany france spain azores north america13 thereafter germany could communicate wireless meant room could listen
submarine cables economic boon trading companies owners ships could communicate captains reached destination side ocean even give directions next pick cargo based reported pricing supply information british government obvious uses cables maintaining administrative communications governors throughout empire well engaging nations diplomatically communicating military units wartime geographic location british territory also advantage included ireland east side atlantic ocean newfoundland north america west side making shortest route across ocean reduced costs significantly

bandwidth problemsedit
early longdistance submarine telegraph cables exhibited formidable electrical problems unlike modern cables technology 19th century allow inline repeater amplifiers cable large voltages used attempt overcome electrical resistance tremendous length cables distributed capacitance inductance combined distort telegraph pulses line reducing cables bandwidth severely limiting data rate telegraph operation 10–12 words minute
early 1816 francis ronalds observed electric signals retarded passing insulated wire core laid underground outlined cause induction using analogy long leyden jar2223 effect noticed latimer clark 1853 cores immersed water particularly lengthy cable england hague michael faraday showed effect caused capacitance wire earth water surrounding faraday noticed wire charged battery example pressing telegraph electric charge wire induces opposite charge water travels along 1831 faraday described effect referred faradays induction charges attract exciting charge retarded core acts capacitor distributed along length cable coupled resistance inductance cable limits speed signal travels conductor cable
early cable designs failed analyze effects correctly famously whitehouse dismissed problems insisted transatlantic cable feasible subsequently became electrician atlantic telegraph company became involved public dispute william thomson whitehouse believed enough voltage cable could driven excessive voltages recommended whitehouse cyrus west fields first transatlantic cable never worked reliably eventually short circuited ocean whitehouse increased voltage beyond cable design limit
thomson designed complex electricfield generator minimized current resonating cable sensitive lightbeam mirror galvanometer detecting faint telegraph signals thomson became wealthy royalties several related inventions thomson elevated lord kelvin contributions area chiefly accurate mathematical model cable permitted design equipment accurate telegraphy effects atmospheric electricity geomagnetic field submarine cables also motivated many early polar expeditions
thomson produced mathematical analysis propagation electrical signals telegraph cables based capacitance resistance since long submarine cables operated slow rates include effects inductance 1890s oliver heaviside produced modern general form telegraphers equations included effects inductance essential extending theory transmission lines higher frequencies required highspeed data voice

1980s fiber optic cables developed first transatlantic telephone cable optical fiber tat8 went operation 1988 fiberoptic cable comprises multiple pairs fibers pair fiber direction tat8 operational pairs backup pair
modern optical fiber repeaters solidstate optical amplifier usually erbiumdoped fiber amplifier repeater contains separate equipment fiber comprise signal reforming error measurement controls solidstate laser dispatches signal next length fiber solidstate laser excites short length doped fiber acts laser amplifier light passes fiber amplified system also permits wavelengthdivision multiplexing dramatically increases capacity fiber
repeaters powered constant direct current passed conductor near center cable repeaters cable series power feed equipment installed terminal stations typically ends share current generation providing positive voltage negative voltage virtual earth point exists roughly halfway along cable normal operation amplifiers repeaters derive power potential difference across
optic fiber used undersea cables chosen exceptional clarity permitting runs kilometers repeaters minimize number amplifiers distortion cause
rising demand fiberoptic cables outpaced capacity providers attwhen shift traffic satellites resulted poorer quality signals address issue improve cable laying abilities invested million producing specialized fiberoptic cable laying vessels included laboratories ships splicing cable testing electrical properties field monitoring important glass fiberoptic cable less malleable copper cable formerly used ships equipped thrusters increase maneuverability capability important fiberoptic cable must laid straight stern another factor copper cable laying ships contend with26
originally submarine cables simple pointtopoint connections development submarine branching units sbus destination could served single cable system modern cable systems usually fibers arranged selfhealing ring increase redundancy submarine sections following different paths ocean floor reason development capacity cable systems become large possible completely backup cable system satellite capacity became necessary provide sufficient terrestrial backup capability telecommunications organizations wish take advantage capability modern cable systems dual landing points countries backup capability required single landing points countries backup capability either required capacity country small enough backed means backup regarded expensive
redundantpath development selfhealing rings approach mesh network whereby fast switching equipment used transfer services network paths little effect higherlevel protocols path becomes inoperable paths become available points less likely simultaneous failures prevent endtoend service
2012 operators successfully demonstrated longterm errorfree transmission gbps across atlantic ocean routes 6000 3700 mi27 meaning typical cable move tens terabits second overseas speeds improved rapidly last years gbits offered route three years earlier august 200928
