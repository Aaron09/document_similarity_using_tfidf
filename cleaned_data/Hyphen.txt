many longestablished words disgusted degrade refresh require hyphen fully fused point first syllable barely even thought prefix function many words prewashed repainted quite fully fused prefix function slightly prominent consciousness nonetheless require hyphen readers recognize closedup word familiar thus trouble parsing syllables words hyphenated many hyphens throughout text would seem superfluous
contrast words closedup style clear hyphen ensure clarity avoid awkwardness including appearance misguided parsing syllables example avoiding misguided parsing would hyphenate word coworker versus coworker prevent readers caught automatically letter group might suggest backtracking reparsing occurred cases styling varies depending individual preference regional preference occupational specialty style guide preference definition awkwardness given word depends judging
