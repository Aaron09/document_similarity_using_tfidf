natural resources resources exist without actions humankind includes valued characteristics magnetic gravitational electrical properties forces earth includes sunlight atmosphere water land includes minerals along vegetation crops animal life naturally subsists upon within heretofore identified characteristics substances1234
particular areas rainforest fatuhiva often characterized biodiversity geodiversity existent ecosystems natural resources classified different ways natural resources materials components something used found within environment every manmade product composed natural resources fundamental level natural resource exist separate entity fresh water well living organism fish exist alternate form must processed obtain resource metal ores rare earth metals petroleum forms energy
much debate worldwide natural resource allocations particularly true periods increasing scarcity shortages depletion overconsumption resources also exportation natural resources basis many economies particularly developed countries
natural resources sunlight found everywhere known ubiquitous resources however resources occur small sporadic areas referred localised resources resources considered inexhaustible foreseeable future solar radiation geothermal energy though access clean vast majority resources theoretically exhaustible means finite quantity depleted managed improperly

classificationedit
various methods categorizing natural resources include source origin stage development renewability
basis origin natural resources divided types

biotic biotic resources obtained biosphere living organic material forests animals materials obtained fossil fuels coal petroleum also included category formed decayed organic matter
abiotic abiotic resources come nonliving nonorganic material examples abiotic resources include land fresh water rare earth metals heavy metals including ores gold iron copper silver

considering stage development natural resources referred following ways

potential resources potential resources exist region used future example petroleum occurs sedimentary rocks various regions time actually drilled remains potential resource
actual resources actual resources surveyed quantity quality determined used present times development actual resource wood processing depends upon technology available cost involved
reserve resources part actual resource developed profitably future called reserve resource
stock resources stock resources surveyed cannot used organisms lack technology example hydrogen

many natural resources categorized either renewable nonrenewable

renewable resources renewable resources replenished naturally resources like sunlight wind water continuously available quantity noticeably affected human consumption though many renewable resources rapid recovery rate resources susceptible depletion overuse resources human perspective classified renewable long rate replenishmentrecovery exceeds rate consumption replenish easily compared nonrenewable resources
nonrenewable resources nonrenewable resources either form slowly naturally form environment minerals common resource included category human perspective resources nonrenewable rate consumption exceeds rate replenishmentrecovery good example fossil fuels category rate formation extremely slow potentially millions years meaning considered nonrenewable resources actually naturally deplete amount without human interference notable radioactive elements uranium naturally decay heavy metals metallic minerals reused recycling them5 coal petroleum cannot recycled6 completely used take millions years replenish

extractionedit
also mining
resource extraction involves activity withdraws resources nature range scale traditional preindustrial societies global industry extractive industries along agriculture basis primary sector economy extraction produces material processed value examples extractive industries hunting trapping mining drilling forestry natural resources substantial amounts countrys wealth7 however sudden inflow money caused resource boom create social problems including inflation harming industries dutch disease corruption leading inequality underdevelopment known resource curse
extractive industries represent large growing activity many lessdeveloped countries wealth generated always lead sustainable inclusive growth extractive industry businesses often assumed interested maximizing shortterm value implying lessdeveloped countries vulnerable powerful corporations alternatively host governments often assumed maximizing immediate revenue researchers argue areas common interest development goals business cross present opportunities international governmental agencies engage private sector host governments revenue management expenditure accountability infrastructure development employment creation skills enterprise development impacts children especially girls women8
