geomorphic features compose called beach profile beach profile changes seasonally change wave energy experienced summer winter months temperate areas summer characterised calmer seas longer periods breaking wave crests beach profile higher summer gentle wave action season tends transport sediment beach towards berm deposited remains water recedes onshore winds carry inland forming enhancing dunes
conversely beach profile lower storm season winter temperate areas increased wave energy shorter periods breaking wave crests higher energy waves breaking quick succession tend mobilise sediment shallows keeping suspension prone carried along beach longshore currents carried form longshore bars especially longshore current meets outflow river flooding stream removal sediment beach berm dune thus decreases beach profile

quartz sand particles shell fragments beach primary component typical beach sand quartz silica sio2



sand shingle scoured graded moved around action waves currents




also beach evolution
beaches result wave action waves currents move sand loose sediments beach made particles held suspension alternatively sand moved saltation bouncing movement large particles
beach materials come erosion rocks offshore well headland erosion slumping producing deposits scree whitest sand world along floridas emerald coast comes erosion quartz appalachian mountains
coral reef offshore significant source sand particles species fish feed algae attached coral outcrops rocks create substantial quantities sand particles lifetime nibble feeding digesting organic matter discarding rock coral particles pass digestive tracts
composition beach depends upon nature quantity sediments upstream beach speed flow turbidity water wind
sediments moved moving water wind according particle size state compaction particles tend settle compact still water compacted resistant erosion established vegetation especially species complex network root systems resist erosion slowing fluid flow surface layer
affected moving water wind particles eroded held suspension increase erosive power fluid holds increasing average density viscosity volume moving fluid
nature sediments found beach tends indicate energy waves wind locality coastlines facing energetic wind wave systems tend hold large rocks smaller particles held suspension turbid water column carried calmer areas longshore currents tides coastlines protected waves winds tend allow finer sediments clays precipitate creating flats mangrove forests
shape beach depends whether waves constructive destructive whether material sand shingle
waves constructive period wave crests long enough breaking water recede sediment settle succeeding wave arrives breaks fine sediment transported lower beach profile compact receding water percolates soaks beach compacted sediment resistant movement turbulent water succeeding waves
conversely waves destructive period wave crests short sediment remains suspension following wave crest arrives able settle compact susceptible erosion longshore currents receding tides
constructive waves move material beach destructive waves move material beach seasons destructive waves prevalent shallows carry increased load sediment organic matter suspension
sandy beaches turbulent backwash destructive waves removes material forming gently sloping beach pebble shingle beaches swash dissipated quickly large particle size allows greater percolation thereby reducing power backwash beach remains steep
compacted fine sediments form smooth beach surface resists wind water erosion calm seasons crust form surface ocean beaches heat evaporates water leaving salt crystallises around sand particles crust forms additional protective layer resists wind erosion unless disturbed animals dissolved advancing tide

beach erosion accretionedit
natural erosion accretionedit




playing surf favourite activity many people



beach galápagos islands reserved marine animals



causesedit
beaches changed shape chiefly movement water wind weather event associated turbid fast flowing water high winds erode exposed beaches longshore currents tend replenish beach sediments repair storm damage tidal waterways generally change shape adjacent beaches small degrees every tidal cycle time changes become substantial leading significant changes size location beach
effects floraedit
changes shape beach undermine roots large trees flora many beach adapted species coconut palms fine root system large root ball tends withstand wave wind action tends stabilize beaches better trees lesser root ball
effects adjacent landedit
erosion beaches expose less resilient soils rocks wind wave action leading undermining coastal headlands eventually resulting catastrophic collapse large quantities overburden shallows material distributed along beach front leading change habitat grasses corals shallows buried deprived light nutrients
manmade erosion accretionedit
coastal areas settled inevitably become subject effects manmade structures processes long periods time influences substantially alter shape coastline character beach
destruction floraedit
beach front flora plays major role stabilizing foredunes preventing beach head erosion inland movement dunes flora network root systems creepers grasses palms able become established provide effective coastal defense trap sand particles rainwater enrich surface layer dunes allowing plant species become established also protect berm erosion high winds freak waves subsiding flood waters
long periods time well stabilized foreshore areas tend accrete unstabilized foreshores tend erode leading substantial changes shape coastline changes usually occur periods many years freak wave events tsunami tidal waves storm surges substantially alter shape profile location beach within hours
destruction flora berm herbicides excessive pedestrian vehicle traffic disruption fresh water flows lead erosion berm dunes destruction flora gradual process imperceptible regular beach users often becomes immediately apparent storms associated high winds freak wave events rapidly move large volumes exposed unstable sand depositing inland carrying permanent water forming offshore bars lagoons increasing area beach exposed tide large rapid movements exposed sand bury smother flora adjacent areas aggravating loss habitat fauna enlarging area instability adequate supply sand weather conditions allow vegetation recover stabilize sediment windblown sand continue advance engulfing permanently altering downwind landscapes

dense vegetation tends absorb rainfall reducing speed runoff releasing longer periods time destruction burning clearance natural vegetation tends increase speed erosive power runoff rainfall runoff tend carry silt organic matter land onto beach flow constant runoff cleared land arriving beach head tend deposit material sand changing color odor fauna
creation beach access pointsedit
concentration pedestrian vehicular traffic accessing beach recreational purposes cause increased erosion access points measures taken stabilize beach surface highwater mark recognition dangers loss beach front flora caused many local authorities responsible managing coastal areas restrict beach access points physical structures legal sanctions fence foredunes effort protect flora measures often associated construction structures access points allow traffic pass dunes without causing damage
concentration runoffedit
beaches provide filter runoff coastal plain runoff naturally dispersed along beach water borne silt organic matter retained land feed flora coastal area runoff dispersed along beach tend percolate beach emerge beach tide
retention fresh water also help maintain underground water reserves resist salt water incursion surface flow runoff diverted concentrated drains create constant flows beach river level beach eroded ultimately form inlet unless longshore flows deposit sediments repair breach
eroded inlet allow tidal inflows salt water pollute areas inland beach also affect quality underground water supplies height water table
deprivation runoffedit
flora naturally occurring beach head requires fresh water runoff land diversion fresh water runoff drains deprive plants water supplies allow water incursion increasing saltiness ground water species able survive salt water replaced mangroves species adapted salty environments
inappropriate beach nourishmentedit
beach nourishment importing deposition sand sediments effort restore beach damaged erosion beach nourishment often involves excavation sediments riverbeds sand quarries excavated sediment substantially different size appearance naturally occurring beach sand
extreme cases beach nourishment involve placement large pebbles rocks effort permanently restore shoreline subject constant erosion loss foreshore often required flow sediment caused longshore current disrupted construction harbors breakwaters causeways boat ramps creating current flows scour sand behind structures deprive beach restorative sediments causes erosion addressed beach nourishment become necessary permanent feature beach maintenance
beach nourishment activities care must taken place sediments sediments compact stabilize aggressive wave wind action erode material concentrated beach form temporary groyne encourage scouring behind sediments fine light eroded compacted integrated established vegetation foreign unwashed sediments introduce flora fauna usually found locality
