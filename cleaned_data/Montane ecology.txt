elevation increases climate becomes cooler decrease greenhouse effect characteristic flora fauna mountains tend strongly depend elevation change climate dependency causes life zones form bands similar ecosystems similar altitude
typical life zones mountains montane forest moderate elevations rainfall temperate climate encourages dense forests grow holdridge defines climate montane forest biotemperature biotemperature mean temperature considering temperatures elevation montane forest trees thin subalpine zone become twisted krummholz eventually fail grow therefore montane forests often contain trees twisted trunks phenomenon observed increase wind strength elevationthe elevation trees fail grow called tree line biotemperature subalpine zone
tree line ecosystem called alpine zone alpine tundra dominated grasses lowgrowing shrubs biotemperature alpine zone many different plant species live alpine environment including perennial grasses sedges forbs cushion plants mosses lichens2 alpine plants must adapt harsh conditions alpine environment include temperatures dryness ultraviolet radiation short growing season alpine plants display adaptations rosette structures waxy surfaces hairy leaves common characteristics zones world wildlife fund groups related ecoregions montane grassland shrubland biome

alpine mire swiss alps


alpine grasslands tundra tree line world intense radiation wind cold snow consequence alpine vegetation close ground consists mainly perennial grasses sedges forbs annual plants rare ecosystem usually inches tall weak root systems14 common plant lifeforms include prostrate shrubs graminoids forming tussocks cryptogams bryophytes lichens2
plants adapted harsh alpine environment cushion plants looking like groundhugging clumps moss escape strong winds blowing inches many flowering plants alpine tundra dense hairs stems leaves provide wind protection redcolored pigments capable converting suns light rays heat plants take years form flower buds survive winter surface open produce fruit seeds weeks summer15 nonflowering lichens cling rocks soil enclosed algal cells photosynthesize temperature outer fungal layers absorb weight water
adaptations survival drying winds cold make tundra vegetation seem hardy respects tundra fragile repeated footsteps often destroy tundra plants leaving exposed soil blow away recovery take hundreds years15
alpine meadows form sediments weathering rocks produced soils welldeveloped enough support grasses sedges alpine grasslands common enough around world categorized biome world wildlife fund biome called montane grasslands shrublands often evolved virtual islands separated montane regions warmer lower elevation regions frequently home many distinctive endemic plants evolved response cool climate abundant sunlight
extensive montane grasslands shrublands occur neotropic páramo andes mountains biome also occurs mountains east central africa mount kinabalu borneo highest elevations western ghats south india central highlands guinea unique feature many tropical montane regions presence giant rosette plants variety plant families lobelia afrotropic puya neotropic cyathea guinea argyroxiphium hawaii
