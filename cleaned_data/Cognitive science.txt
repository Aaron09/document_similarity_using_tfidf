levels analysisedit
central tenet cognitive science complete understanding mindbrain cannot attained studying single level example would problem remembering phone number recalling later approach understanding process would study behavior direct observation naturalistic observation person could presented phone number asked recall delay time accuracy response could measured another approach measure cognitive ability would study firings individual neurons person trying remember phone number neither experiments would fully explain process remembering phone number works even technology every neuron brain realtime available known neuron firing would still impossible know particular firing neurons translates observed behavior thus understanding levels relate imperative embodied mind cognitive science human experience says “the sciences mind need enlarge horizon encompass lived human experience possibilities transformation inherent human experience”4 provided functional level account process studying particular phenomenon multiple levels creates better understanding processes occur brain give rise particular behavior marr5 gave famous description three levels analysis

knowledge processing languageedit




well known example phrase structure tree representing human language shows different components organized hierarchically


main articles theoretical linguistics cognitive linguistics language linguistics psycholinguistics
ability learn understand language extremely complex process language acquired within first years life humans normal circumstances able acquire language proficiently major driving force theoretical linguistic field discovering nature language must abstract order learned fashion driving research questions studying brain processes language include extent linguistic knowledge innate learned difficult adults acquire secondlanguage infants acquire firstlanguage humans able understand novel sentences
study language processing ranges investigation sound patterns speech meaning words whole sentences linguistics often divides language processing orthography phonetics phonology morphology syntax semantics pragmatics many aspects language studied components interaction
study language processing cognitive science closely tied field linguistics linguistics traditionally studied part humanities including studies history literature last fifty years researchers studied knowledge language cognitive phenomenon main problems knowledge language acquired used precisely consists linguists found humans form sentences ways apparently governed complex systems remarkably unaware rules govern speech thus linguists must resort indirect methods determine rules might indeed rules exist event speech indeed governed rules appear opaque conscious consideration
learning developmentedit
main articles learning developmental psychology
learning development processes acquire knowledge information time infants born little knowledge depending knowledge defined rapidly acquire ability language walk recognize people objects research learning development aims explain mechanisms processes might take place
major question study cognitive development extent certain abilities innate learned often framed terms nature nurture debate nativist view emphasizes certain features innate organism determined genetic endowment empiricist view hand emphasizes certain abilities learned environment although clearly genetic environmental input needed child develop normally considerable debate remains genetic information might guide cognitive development area language acquisition example steven pinker10 argued specific information containing universal grammatical rules must contained genes whereas others jeffrey elman colleagues rethinking innateness argued pinkers claims biologically unrealistic argue genes determine architecture learning system specific facts grammar works learned result experience
memoryedit
main article memory
memory allows store information later retrieval memory often thought consisting longterm shortterm store longterm memory allows store information prolonged periods days weeks years know practical limit longterm memory capacity shortterm memory allows store information short time scales seconds minutes
memory also often grouped declarative procedural forms declarative memory—grouped subsets semantic episodic forms memory—refers memory facts specific knowledge specific meanings specific experiences first president breakfast four days procedural memory allows remember actions motor sequences ride bicycle often dubbed implicit knowledge memory
cognitive scientists study memory psychologists tend focus memory bears cognitive processes interrelationship cognition memory example could mental processes person retrieve longlost memory differentiates cognitive process recognition seeing hints something remembering memory context recall retrieving memory fillintheblank
perception actionedit

optical illusion square exactly shade gray square checker shadow illusion


main article perception
perception ability take information senses process vision hearing dominant senses allow perceive environment questions study visual perception example include able recognize objects perceive continuous visual environment even though small bits time tool studying visual perception looking people process optical illusions image right necker cube example bistable percept cube interpreted oriented different directions
study haptic tactile olfactory gustatory stimuli also fall domain perception
action taken refer output system humans accomplished motor responses spatial planning movement speech production complex motor movements aspects action
consciousnessedit
main article consciousness
consciousness awareness whether something external object something within oneself helps mind ability experience feel sense self
research methodsedit
many different methodologies used study cognitive science field highly interdisciplinary research often cuts across multiple areas study drawing research methods psychology neuroscience computer science systems theory
behavioral experimentsedit
order description constitutes intelligent behavior must study behavior type research closely tied cognitive psychology psychophysics measuring behavioral responses different stimuli understand something stimuli processed lewandowski strohmetz 2009 review collection innovative uses behavioral measurement psychology including behavioral traces behavioral observations behavioral choice11 behavioral traces pieces evidence indicate behavior occurred actor present litter parking readings electric meter behavioral observations involve direct witnessing actor engaging behavior watching close person sits next another person behavioral choices person selects options voting behavior choice punishment another participant

reaction time time presentation stimulus appropriate response indicate differences cognitive processes indicate things nature example search task reaction times vary proportionally number elements evident cognitive process searching involves serial instead parallel processing
psychophysical responses psychophysical experiments psychological technique adopted cognitive psychology typically involve making judgments physical property loudness sound correlation subjective scales individuals show cognitive sensory biases compared actual physical measurements examples include

sameness judgments colors tones textures
threshold differences colors tones textures


tracking methodology used study variety cognitive processes notably visual perception language processing fixation point eyes linked individuals focus attention thus monitoring movements study information processed given time tracking allows study cognitive processes extremely short time scales movements reflect online decision making task provide insight ways decisions processed

brain imagingedit
main article neuroimaging




image human head brain arrow indicates position hypothalamus


brain imaging involves analyzing activity within brain performing various tasks allows link behavior brain function help understand information processed different types imaging techniques vary temporal timebased spatial locationbased resolution brain imaging often used cognitive neuroscience

single photon emission computed tomography positron emission tomography spect radioactive isotopes injected subjects bloodstream taken brain observing areas brain take radioactive isotope areas brain active areas similar spatial resolution fmri extremely poor temporal resolution
electroencephalography measures electrical fields generated large populations neurons cortex placing series electrodes scalp subject technique extremely high temporal resolution relatively poor spatial resolution
functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri measures relative amount oxygenated blood flowing different parts brain oxygenated blood particular region assumed correlate increase neural activity part brain allows localize particular functions within different brain regions fmri moderate spatial temporal resolution
optical imaging technique uses infrared transmitters receivers measure amount light reflectance blood near different areas brain since oxygenated deoxygenated blood reflects light different amounts study areas active oxygenated blood optical imaging moderate temporal resolution poor spatial resolution also advantage extremely safe used study infants brains
magnetoencephalography measures magnetic fields resulting cortical activity similar except improved spatial resolution since magnetic fields measures blurred attenuated scalp meninges forth electrical activity measured uses squid sensors detect tiny magnetic fields

computational modelingedit




neural network layers


computational models require mathematically logically formal representation problem computer models used simulation experimental verification different specific general properties intelligence computational modeling help understand functional organization particular cognitive phenomenon basic approaches cognitive modeling first focused abstract mental functions intelligent mind operates using symbols second follows neural associative properties human brain called subsymbolic

symbolic modeling evolved computer science paradigms using technologies knowledgebased systems well philosophical perspective example good oldfashioned artificial intelligence gofai developed first cognitive researchers later used information engineering expert systems since early 1990s generalized systemics investigation functional humanlike intelligence models personoids parallel developed soar environment recently especially context cognitive decision making symbolic cognitive modeling extended sociocognitive approach including social organization cognition interrelated subsymbolic conscious layer
subsymbolic modeling includes connectionistneural network models connectionism relies idea mindbrain composed simple nodes power system comes primarily existence manner connections simple nodes neural nets textbook implementations approach critics approach feel models approach biological reality representation system works lack explanatory powers complicated systems connections even simple rules extremely complex often less interpretable system model

approaches gaining popularity include dynamical systems theory also techniques putting symbolic models connectionist models correspondence neuralsymbolic integration bayesian models often drawn machine learning also gaining popularity12
approaches tend generalized form integrated computational models syntheticabstract intelligence order applied explanation improvement individual socialorganizational decisionmaking reasoning

historyedit
cognitive sciences began intellectual movement 1950s called cognitive revolution cognitive science prehistory traceable back ancient greek philosophical texts platos meno aristotles anima includes writers descartes david hume immanuel kant benedict spinoza nicolas malebranche pierre cabanis leibniz john locke however although early writers contributed greatly philosophical discovery mind would ultimately lead development psychology working entirely different tools core concepts cognitive scientist
modern culture cognitive science traced back early cyberneticists 1930s 1940s warren mcculloch walter pitts sought understand organizing principles mind mcculloch pitts developed first variants known artificial neural networks models computation inspired structure biological neural networks
another precursor early development theory computation digital computer 1940s 1950s alan turing john neumann instrumental developments modern computer neumann machine would play central role cognitive science metaphor mind tool investigation
first instance cognitive science experiments done academic institution took place sloan school management established licklider working within social psychology department conducting experiments using computer memory models human cognition13
1959 noam chomsky published scathing review skinners book verbal behavior time skinners behaviorist paradigm dominated psychology psychologists focused functional relations stimulus response without positing internal representations chomsky argued order explain language needed theory like generative grammar attributed internal representations characterized underlying order
term cognitive science coined christopher longuethiggins 1973 commentary lighthill report concerned thencurrent state artificial intelligence research14 decade journal cognitive science cognitive science society founded15 founding meeting cognitive science society held university california diego 1979 resulted cognitive science becoming internationally visible enterprise16 1972 hampshire college started first undergraduate education program cognitive science neil stillings 1982 assistance professor stillings vassar college became first institution world grant undergraduate degree cognitive science17 1986 first cognitive science department world founded university california diego16
1970s early 1980s much cognitive science research focused possibility artificial intelligence researchers marvin minsky would write computer programs languages lisp attempt formally characterize steps human beings went instance making decisions solving problems hope better understanding human thought also hope creating artificial minds approach known symbolic
eventually limits symbolic research program became apparent instance seemed unrealistic comprehensively list human knowledge form usable symbolic computer program late rise neural networks connectionism research paradigm point view often attributed james mcclelland david rumelhart mind could characterized complex associations represented layered network critics argue phenomena better captured symbolic models connectionist models often complex little explanatory power recently symbolic connectionist models combined making possible take advantage forms explanation1819
