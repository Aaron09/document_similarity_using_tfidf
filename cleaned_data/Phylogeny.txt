historyedit
idea tree life arose ancient notions ladderlike progression lower higher forms life great chain early representations branching phylogenetic trees include paleontological chart showing geological relationships among plants animals book elementary geology edward hitchcock first edition 1840
charles darwin 1859 also produced first illustrations crucially popularized notion evolutionary tree seminal book origin species century later evolutionary biologists still tree diagrams depict evolution diagrams effectively convey concept speciation occurs adaptive semirandom splitting lineages time species classification become less static dynamic
typesedit
rooted treeedit
rooted phylogenetic tree graphics directed tree unique node root corresponding usually imputed recent common ancestor entities leaves tree root node parent node serves parent nodes tree root therefore node degree internal nodes minimum degree degree refers total number incoming outgoing edges
common method rooting trees uncontroversial outgroup—close enough allow inference trait data molecular sequencing enough clear outgroup
unrooted treeedit




unrooted phylogenetic tree myosin superfamily proteins1


unrooted trees illustrate relatedness leaf nodes without making assumptions ancestry require ancestral root known inferred2 unrooted trees always generated rooted ones simply omitting root contrast inferring root unrooted tree requires means identifying ancestry normally done including outgroup input data root necessarily outgroup rest taxa tree introducing additional assumptions relative rates evolution branch application molecular clock hypothesis3

constructionedit
main article computational phylogenetics
phylogenetic trees composed nontrivial number input sequences constructed using computational phylogenetics methods distancematrix methods neighborjoining upgma calculate genetic distance multiple sequence alignments simplest implement invoke evolutionary model many sequence alignment methods clustalw also create trees using simpler algorithms based distance tree construction maximum parsimony another simple method estimating phylogenetic trees implies implicit model evolution parsimony advanced methods optimality criterion maximum likelihood often within bayesian framework apply explicit model evolution phylogenetic tree estimation4 identifying optimal tree using many techniques nphard4 heuristic search optimization methods used combination treescoring functions identify reasonably good tree fits data
treebuilding methods assessed basis several criteria10

efficiency long take compute answer much memory need
power make good data information wasted
consistency converge answer repeatedly time given different data model problem
robustness cope well violations assumptions underlying model
falsifiability alert good assumptions violated

treebuilding techniques also gained attention mathematicians trees also built using ttheory11
