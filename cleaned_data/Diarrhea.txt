diarrhea defined world health organization three loose liquid stools stools normal person2
acute diarrhea defined abnormally frequent discharge semisolid fluid fecal matter bowel lasting less days world gastroenterology organization13
secretory
secretory diarrhea means increase active secretion inhibition absorption little structural damage common cause type diarrhea cholera toxin stimulates secretion anions especially chloride ions therefore maintain charge balance gastrointestinal tract sodium carried along water type diarrhea intestinal fluid secretion isotonic plasma even fasting1415 continues even oral food intake
osmotic
osmotic diarrhea occurs much water drawn bowels person drinks solutions excessive sugar excessive salt draw water body bowel cause osmotic diarrhea1615 osmotic diarrhea also result maldigestion pancreatic disease coeliac disease nutrients left lumen pull water caused osmotic laxatives work alleviate constipation drawing water bowels healthy individuals much magnesium vitamin undigested lactose produce osmotic diarrhea distention bowel person lactose intolerance difficulty absorbing lactose extraordinarily high intake dairy products persons fructose malabsorption excess fructose intake also cause diarrhea highfructose foods also high glucose content absorbable less likely cause diarrhea sugar alcohols sorbitol often found sugarfree foods difficult body absorb large amounts lead osmotic diarrhea14 cases osmotic diarrhea stops offending agent milk sorbitol stopped
exudative
exudative diarrhea occurs presence blood stool occurs inflammatory bowel diseases crohns disease ulcerative colitis severe infections coli forms food poisoning1514
inflammatory
inflammatory diarrhea occurs damage mucosal lining brush border leads passive loss proteinrich fluids decreased ability absorb lost fluids features three types diarrheaclarification needed found type diarrhea caused bacterial infections viral infections parasitic infections autoimmune problems inflammatory bowel diseases also caused tuberculosis colon cancer enteritis15
dysentery
blood visible stools also known dysentery blood trace invasion bowel tissue dysentery symptom among others shigella entamoeba histolytica salmonella15
health effects
diarrheal disease negative impact physical fitness mental development early childhood malnutrition resulting cause reduces physical fitness work productivity adults17 diarrhea primary cause childhood malnutrition18 evidence suggests diarrheal disease significant impacts mental development health shown even controlling helminth infection early breastfeeding children experienced severe diarrhea significantly lower scores series tests intelligence1719
diarrhea cause electrolyte imbalances renal impairment dehydration defective immune system responses oral drugs administered efficiency drug produce therapeutic effect lack effect medication travelling quickly digestive system limiting time absorbed clinicians treat diarrheas reducing dosage medication changing dosing schedule discontinuation drug rehydration interventions control diarrhea often effective diarrhea profound effect quality life fecal incontinence leading factors placing older adults long term care facilities nursing homes15

differential diagnosis




diagram human gastrointestinal tract


acute diarrhea commonly viral gastroenteritis rotavirus accounts cases children five1 travelers however bacterial infections predominate20 various toxins mushroom poisoning drugs also cause acute diarrhea
chronic diarrhea part presentations number chronic medical conditions affecting intestine common causes include ulcerative colitis crohns disease microscopic colitis celiac disease irritable bowel syndrome bile acid malabsorption
infections
main article infectious diarrhea
many causes infectious diarrhea include viruses bacteria parasites21 infectious diarrhea frequently referred gastroenteritis22 norovirus common cause viral diarrhea adults23 rotavirus common cause children five years old24 adenovirus types 4125 astroviruses cause significant number infections26
campylobacter common cause bacterial diarrhea infections salmonella shigella strains escherichia coli also frequent cause27
elderly particularly treated antibiotics unrelated infections toxin produced clostridium difficile often causes severe diarrhea28
parasites particularly protozoa cryptosporidium giardia entamoeba histolytica blastocystis cyclospora cayetanensis frequently cause diarrhea involves chronic infection broadspectrum antiparasitic agent nitazoxanide shown efficacy many diarrheacausing parasites29
infectious agents parasites bacterial toxins exacerbate symptoms20 sanitary living conditions ample food supply clean water otherwise healthy person usually recovers viral infections days however malnourished individuals diarrhea lead severe dehydration become lifethreatening30
malabsorption
main article malabsorption
malabsorption inability absorb food fully mostly disorders small bowel also maldigestion diseases pancreas
causes include

enzyme deficiencies mucosal abnormality food allergy food intolerance celiac disease gluten intolerance lactose intolerance intolerance milk sugar common noneuropeans fructose malabsorption
pernicious anemia impaired bowel function inability absorb vitamin
loss pancreatic secretions cystic fibrosis pancreatitis
structural defects like short bowel syndrome surgically removed bowel radiation fibrosis usually follows cancer treatment drugs including agents used chemotherapy
certain drugs like orlistat inhibits absorption

inflammatory bowel disease
main article inflammatory bowel disease
overlapping types unknown origin

ulcerative colitis marked chronic bloody diarrhea inflammation mostly affects distal colon near rectum
crohns disease typically affects fairly well demarcated segments bowel colon often affects small bowel

irritable bowel syndrome
main article irritable bowel syndrome
another possible cause diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome usually presents abdominal discomfort relieved defecation unusual stool diarrhea constipation least days week previous months31 symptoms diarrheapredominant managed combination dietary changes soluble fiber supplements medications loperamide codeine patients diarrheapredominant bile acid malabsorption diagnosed abnormal sehcat test32
diseases
diarrhea caused diseases conditions namely

chronic ethanol ingestion33
ischemic bowel disease usually affects older people blocked arteries
microscopic colitis type inflammatory bowel disease changes seen histological examination colonic biopsies
bile salt malabsorption primary bile acid diarrhea excessive bile acids colon produce secretory diarrhea
hormonesecreting tumors hormones serotonin cause diarrhea excreted excess usually tumor
chronic mild diarrhea infants toddlers occur obvious cause effects condition called toddlers diarrhea
environmental enteropathy
radiation enteropathy following treatment pelvic abdominal cancers

causes
sanitation




poverty often leads unhygienic living conditions community indian himalayas conditions promote contraction diarrheal diseases result poor sanitation hygiene


open defecation leading cause infectious diarrhea leading death34
poverty good indicator rate infectious diarrhea population association stem poverty rather conditions impoverished people live absence certain resources compromises ability poor defend infectious diarrhea poverty associated poor housing crowding dirt floors lack access clean water sanitary disposal fecal waste sanitation cohabitation domestic animals carry human pathogens lack refrigerated storage food increase frequency diarrhea poverty also restricts ability provide ageappropriate nutritionally balanced diets modify diets diarrhea develops mitigate repair nutrient losses impact exacerbated lack adequate available affordable medical care35
water
common causes infectious diarrhea lack clean water often improper fecal disposal leads contamination groundwater lead widespread infection among population especially absence water filtration purification human feces contains variety potentially harmful human pathogens36
nutrition
proper nutrition important health functioning including prevention infectious diarrhea especially important young children fully developed immune system zinc deficiency condition often found children developing countries even mild cases significant impact development proper functioning human immune system3738 indeed relationship zinc deficiency reduced immune functioning corresponds increased severity infectious diarrhea children lowered levels zinc greater number instances diarrhea severe diarrhea diarrhea associated fever39 similarly vitamin deficiency cause increase severity diarrheal episodes however discrepancy comes impact vitamin deficiency rate disease argue relationship exist rate disease vitamin status40 others suggest increase rate associated deficiency41 given estimates suggest million preschool children worldwide vitamin deficient population potential increased risk disease contraction42
medications
medications penicillum cause diarrhea4344 medications known cause diarrhea classes medications known cause diarrhea laxatives antacids heartburn medications antibiotics antineoplastic drugs antiinflammatories well many dietary supplements15
pathophysiology
evolution
according researchers nesse williams diarrhea function evolved expulsion defense mechanism result stopped might delay recovery45 cite support argument research published 1973 found treating shigella antidiarrhea drug cophenotrope lomotil caused people stay feverish twice long treated researchers indeed observed lomotil contraindicated shigellosis diarrhea represent defense mechanism46
diagnostic approach
following types diarrhea indicate investigation needed

infants
moderate severe diarrhea young children
associated blood
continues days
associated noncramping abdominal pain fever weight loss
travelers
food handlers potential infect others
institutions hospitals child care centers geriatric convalescent homes

severity score used diagnosis children47
prevention
sanitation
numerous studies shown improvements drinking water sanitation wash lead decreased risks diarrhoea48 improvements might include example water filters provision highquality piped water sewer connections48
institutions communities households interventions promote hand washing soap lead significant reductions incidence diarrhea49 applies preventing open defecation communitywide level providing access improved sanitation5051 includes toilets implementation entire sanitation chain connected toilets collection transport disposal reuse human excreta
hand washing
basic sanitation techniques profound effect transmission diarrheal disease implementation hand washing using soap water example experimentally shown reduce incidence disease approximately 42–485253 hand washing developing countries however compromised poverty acknowledged handwashing integral disease prevention parts world however access soap water limited number less developed countries lack access many challenges proper hygiene less developed countries solutions barrier require implementation educational programs encourage sanitary behaviours54
water
given water contamination major means transmitting diarrheal disease efforts provide clean water supply improved sanitation potential dramatically rate disease incidence fact proposed might expect reduction child mortality resulting diarrheal disease result improved water sanitation hygiene3655 similarly metaanalysis numerous studies improving water supply sanitation shows 22–27 reduction disease incidence 21–30 reduction mortality rate associated diarrheal disease56
chlorine treatment water example shown reduce risk diarrheal disease contamination stored water diarrheal pathogens57
vaccination
immunization pathogens cause diarrheal disease viable prevention strategy however require targeting certain pathogens vaccination case rotavirus responsible around diarrheal episodes diarrheal disease deaths children developing countries rotavirus vaccine trials 1985 yielded slight decrease total diarrheal disease incidence reducing overall mortality similarly cholera vaccine showed strong reduction morbidity mortality though overall impact vaccination minimal cholera major causative pathogens diarrheal disease58 since time effective vaccines developed potential save many thousands lives developing nations reducing overall cost treatment costs society5960
rotavirus vaccine decrease rates diarrhea population1 vaccines rotavirus shigella enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec cholera development well causes infectious diarrheamedical citation needed
nutrition
dietary deficiencies developing countries combated promoting better eating practices zinc supplementation proved successful showing significant decrease incidence diarrheal disease compared control group6162 majority literature suggests vitamin supplementation advantageous reducing disease incidence63 development supplementation strategy take consideration fact vitamin supplementation less effective reducing diarrhea incidence compared vitamin zinc supplementation latter strategy estimated significantly cost effective64
breastfeeding
breastfeeding practices shown dramatic effect incidence diarrheal disease poor populations studies across number developing nations shown receive exclusive breastfeeding first months life better protected infection diarrheal diseases65 exclusive breastfeeding currently recommended least first months infants life who66
others
probiotics decrease risk diarrhea taking antibiotics67
management
many cases diarrhea replacing lost fluid salts treatment needed usually mouth oral rehydration therapy severe cases intravenously1 diet restrictions brat diet longer recommended68 research support limiting milk children effect duration diarrhea69 contrary recommends children diarrhea continue sufficient nutrients usually still absorbed support continued growth weight gain continuing also speeds recovery normal intestinal functioning16 recommends children adults cholera also continue eat70
medications loperamide imodium bismuth subsalicylate beneficial however contraindicated certain situations71
fluids
also management dehydration




person consuming oral rehydration solution


oral rehydration solution slightly sweetened salty water used prevent dehydration standard home solutions salted rice water salted yogurt drinks vegetable chicken soups salt given home solutions water cereal cooked unsalted soup green coconut water weak unsweetened unsweetened fresh fruit juices half teaspoon full teaspoon salt oneandahalf three grams added liter clean plain water also several fluids given16 commercial solutions pedialyte relief agencies unicef widely distribute packets salts sugar publication physicians recommends homemade consisting liter water teaspoon salt grams tablespoons sugar grams added16 approximately taste tears72 rehydration project recommends adding amount sugar onehalf teaspoon salt stating dilute approach less risky little loss effectiveness73 agree drinks much sugar salt make dehydration worse1673
appropriate amounts supplemental zinc potassium added available availability delay rehydration points important thing begin preventing dehydration early possible16 another example prompt hopefully preventing dehydration recommends treatment cholera continuing give oral rehydration solution travel medical treatment70
vomiting often occurs first hour treatment especially child drinks solution quickly seldom prevents successful rehydration since fluid still absorbed recommends child vomits wait five minutes start give solution slowly16
drinks especially high simple sugars soft drinks fruit juices recommended children years increase dehydration rich solution draws water rest body person drink water1674 plain water used specific effective preparations unavailable palatable74 additionally plain water drinks perhaps rich sugar salt alternatively given person goal providing medium amount sodium overall16 nasogastric tube used young children administer fluids warranted75
eating
recommends child diarrhea continue continued feeding speeds recovery normal intestinal function contrast children whose food restricted diarrhea longer duration recover intestinal function slowly child also continue breastfed states food never withheld childs usual foods diluted breastfeeding always continued16 specific example cholera also makes recommendation70 young children breastfed live developed world lactosefree diet useful speed recovery76
medications
antibiotics beneficial certain types acute diarrhea usually used except specific situations7778 concerns antibiotics increase risk hemolytic uremic syndrome people infected escherichia coli o157h779 resourcepoor countries treatment antibiotics beneficial78 however bacteria developing antibiotic resistance particularly shigella80 antibiotics also cause diarrhea antibioticassociated diarrhea common adverse effect treatment general antibiotics
bismuth compounds peptobismol decreased number bowel movements travelers diarrhea decrease length illness81 antimotility agents like loperamide also effective reducing number stools duration disease7 agents used bloody diarrhea present82
bile acid sequestrants cholestyramine effective chronic diarrhea bile acid malabsorption therapeutic trials drugs indicated chronic diarrhea bile acid malabsorption cannot diagnosed specific test sehcat retention
alternative therapies
zinc supplementation benefit children months diarrhea areas high rates malnourishment zinc deficiency83 supports world health organization guidelines zinc young
probiotics reduce duration symptoms reduced chances symptoms lasting longer four days 6084 probiotic lactobacillus help prevent antibioticassociated diarrhea adults possibly children85 lactose intolerance taking digestive enzymes containing lactase consuming dairy products often improves symptoms
