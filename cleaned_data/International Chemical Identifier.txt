overviewedit
identifiers describe chemical substances terms layers information atoms bond connectivity tautomeric information isotope information stereochemistry electronic charge information5 layers provided instance tautomer layer omitted type information relevant particular application
inchis differ widely used registry numbers three respects

freely usable nonproprietary
computed structural information assigned organization
information inchi human readable practice

inchis thus seen akin general extremely formalized version iupac names express information simpler smiles notation differ every structure unique inchi string important database applications information 3dimensional coordinates atoms represented inchi purpose format used
inchi algorithm converts input structural information unique inchi identifier threestep process normalization remove redundant information canonicalization generate unique number label atom serialization give string characters
inchikey sometimes referred hashed inchi fixed length character condensed digital representation inchi humanunderstandable inchikey specification released september 2007 order facilitate searches chemical compounds since problematic fulllength inchi6 noted unlike inchi inchikey unique though collisions calculated rare happen7
january 2009 final version inchi software released provided means generate called standard inchi allow user selectable options dealing stereochemistry tautomeric layers inchi string standard inchikey hashed version standard inchi string standard inchi simplify comparison inchi strings keys generated different groups subsequently accessed diverse sources databases resources

hydrogen atoms prefix describes many hydrogen atoms connected atoms

stereochemical layer

isotopic layer prefixes well isotopic stereochemistry
fixedh layer prefix contains types layers except atom connections sublayer never included standard inchi
reconnected layer prefix contains whole inchi structure reconnected metal atoms never included standard inchi

morphine structure


condensed character inchikey hashed version full inchi using sha256 algorithm designed allow easy searches chemical compounds6 standard inchikey hashed counterpart standard inchi chemical structures 2007 represented files searchable chemical content full inchi turned lengthy easy searching therefore inchikey developed small nonzero chance different molecules inchikey probability duplication first characters estimated duplication databases containing billion unique structures databases currently million structures duplication appears unlikely present recent study extensively studies collision rate finding experimental collision rate agreement theoretical expectations8
inchikeys consist characters resulting hash connectivity information inchi followed hyphen followed characters resulting hash remaining layers inchi followed single character indicating kind inchikey followed single character indicating version inchi used another hyphen followed single character indicating protonation9
