defining scienceedit
main article demarcation problem




karl popper 1980s


distinguishing science nonscience referred demarcation problem example psychoanalysis considered science socalled creation science inflationary multiverse hypothesis macroeconomics karl popper called central question philosophy science2 however unified account problem acceptance among philosophers regard problem unsolvable uninteresting34 martin gardner argued potter stewart standard know recognizing pseudoscience5
early attempts logical positivists grounded science observation nonscience nonobservational hence meaningless6 popper argued central property science falsifiability every genuinely scientific claim capable proven false least principle7
area study speculation masquerades science attempt claim legitimacy would otherwise able achieve referred pseudoscience fringe science junk science8 physicist richard feynman coined term cargo cult science cases researchers believe science activities outward appearance actually lack kind utter honesty allows results rigorously evaluated9
scientific explanationedit
main article scientific explanation
closely related question counts good scientific explanation addition providing predictions future events society often takes scientific theories provide explanations events occur regularly already occurred philosophers investigated criteria scientific theory said successfully explained phenomenon well means scientific theory explanatory power
early influential theory scientific explanation deductivenomological model says successful scientific explanation must deduce occurrence phenomena question scientific law10 view subjected substantial criticism resulting several widely acknowledged counterexamples theory11 especially challenging characterize meant explanation thing explained cannot deduced matter chance otherwise cannot perfectly predicted known wesley salmon developed model good scientific explanation must statistically relevant outcome explained1213 others argued good explanation unifying disparate phenomena providing causal mechanism13
justifying scienceedit
main article problem induction




expectations chickens might form farmer behavior illustrate problem induction


although often taken granted clear infer validity general statement number specific instances infer truth theory series successful tests14 example chicken observes morning farmer comes gives food hundreds days chicken therefore inductive reasoning infer farmer bring food every morning however morning farmer comes kills chicken scientific reasoning trustworthy chickens reasoning
approach acknowledge induction cannot achieve certainty observing instances general statement least make general statement probable chicken would right conclude mornings likely farmer come food next morning even cannot certain however remain difficult questions process interpreting given evidence probability general statement true particular difficulties declare beliefs scientific theories subjective personal correct reasoning merely evidence change ones subjective beliefs time14
argue scientists inductive reasoning rather abductive reasoning inference best explanation account science generalizing specific instances rather hypothesizing explanations observed discussed previous section always clear meant best explanation ockhams razor counsels choosing simplest available explanation thus plays important role versions approach return example chicken would simpler suppose farmer cares continue taking care indefinitely farmer fattening slaughter philosophers tried make heuristic principle precise terms theoretical parsimony measures although various measures simplicity brought forward potential candidates generally accepted thing theoryindependent measure simplicity words appear many different measures simplicity theories task choosing measures simplicity appears every problematic choosing theories15
observation inseparable theoryedit




celestial object known einstein cross


making observations scientists look telescopes study images electronic screens record meter readings generally basic level agree thermometer shows degrees scientists different ideas theories developed explain basic observations disagree observing example albert einsteins general theory relativity observers would likely interpreted image right five different objects space light theory however astronomers tell actually objects center four different images second object around sides alternatively scientists suspect something wrong telescope object actually observed operating another theory observations cannot separated theoretical interpretation said theoryladen16
observation involves perception cognition make observation passively rather actively engaged distinguishing phenomenon observed surrounding sensory data therefore observations affected ones underlying understanding world functions understanding influence perceived noticed deemed worthy consideration sense argued observation theoryladen16
purpose scienceedit
also scientific realism instrumentalism
science determine ultimate truth questions science cannot answer scientific realists claim science aims truth ought regard scientific theories true approximately true likely true conversely scientific antirealists argue science least succeed truth especially truth unobservables like electrons universes17 instrumentalists argue scientific theories evaluated whether useful view whether theories true beside point purpose science make predictions enable effective technology
realists often point success recent scientific theories evidence truth near truth current theories1819 antirealists point either many false theories history science2021 epistemic morals22 success false modeling assumptions23 widely termed postmodern criticisms objectivity evidence scientific realism18 antirealists attempt explain success scientific theories without reference truth24 antirealists claim scientific theories accurate observable objects argue success primarily judged criterion22
values scienceedit
values intersect science different ways epistemic values mainly guide scientific research scientific enterprise embedded particular culture values individual practitioners values emerge science product process distributed among several cultures society
unclear counts science process confirming theories works purpose science considerable scope values social influences shape science indeed values play role ranging determining research gets funded influencing theories achieve scientific consensus25 example 19th century cultural values held scientists race shaped research evolution values concerning social class influenced debates phrenology considered scientific time26 feminist philosophers science sociologists science others explore social values affect science

logical positivismedit
main article logical positivism
instrumentalism became popular among physicists around turn 20th century logical positivism defined field several decades logical positivism accepts testable statements meaningful rejects metaphysical interpretations embraces verificationism theories knowledge combines logicism empiricism linguistics ground philosophy basis consistent examples empirical sciences seeking overhaul philosophy convert scientific philosophy33 berlin circle vienna circle propounded logical positivism late 1920s
interpreting ludwig wittgensteins early philosophy language logical positivists identified verifiability principle criterion cognitive meaningfulness bertrand russells logicism sought reduction mathematics logic also embraced russells logical atomism ernst machs phenomenalism—whereby mind knows actual potential sensory experience content sciences whether physics psychology—and percy bridgmans operationalism thereby verifiable scientific cognitively meaningful whereas unverifiable unscientific cognitively meaningless pseudostatements—metaphysical emotive such—not worthy review philosophers newly tasked organize knowledge rather develop knowledge
logical positivism commonly portrayed taking extreme position scientific language never refer anything unobservable—even seemingly core notions causality mechanism principles—but exaggeration talk unobservables could allowed metaphorical—direct observations viewed abstract—or worst metaphysical emotional theoretical laws would reduced empirical laws theoretical terms would garner meaning observational terms correspondence rules mathematics physics would reduce symbolic logic logicism rational reconstruction would convert ordinary language standardized equivalents networked united logical syntax scientific theory would stated method verification whereby logical calculus empirical operation could verify falsity truth
late 1930s logical positivists fled germany austria britain america many replaced machs phenomenalism otto neuraths physicalism rudolf carnap sought replace verification simply confirmation world close 1945 logical positivism became milder logical empiricism largely carl hempel america expounded covering model scientific explanation identifying logical form explanations without reference suspect notion causation logical positivist movement became major underpinning analytic philosophy34 dominated anglosphere philosophy including philosophy science influencing sciences 1960s movement failed resolve central problems353637 doctrines increasingly assaulted nevertheless brought establishment philosophy science distinct subdiscipline philosophy carl hempel playing role38

1962 book structure scientific revolutions thomas kuhn argued process observation evaluation takes place within paradigm logically consistent portrait world consistent observations made framing paradigm also encompasses questions practices define scientific discipline characterized normal science process observation puzzle solving takes place within paradigm whereas revolutionary science occurs paradigm overtakes another paradigm shift39
kuhn denied ever possible isolate hypothesis tested influence theory observations grounded argued possible evaluate competing paradigms independently logically consistent construct paint usable likeness world common ground theory theory paradigm distinct questions aims interpretations neither provides standard judged clear measure scientific progress across paradigms
kuhn choice paradigm sustained rational processes ultimately determined choice paradigms involves setting portraits world deciding likeness promising kuhn acceptance rejection paradigm social process much logical process kuhns position however relativism40 according kuhn paradigm shift occurs significant number observational anomalies arise paradigm paradigm makes sense choice paradigm based observations even though observations made background paradigm

typically implicit philosophy working scientists following basic assumptions needed justify scientific method

objective reality shared rational observers4344 basis rationality acceptance external objective reality45 objective reality clearly essential thing develop meaningful perspective world nevertheless existence assumed46 belief objective reality exist assumption arises real world outside infants made assumption unconsciously people happy make assumption adds meaning sensations feelings live solipsism47 without assumption would thoughts images mind would existing mind would need science anything else48
objective reality governed natural laws4344 science least today assumes universe obeys knoweable principles dont depend time place subjective parameters think know behave45 hugh gauch argues science presupposes physical world orderly comprehensible49
reality discovered means systematic observation experimentation4344 stanley sobottka said assumption external reality necessary science function flourish part science discovering explaining external world48 science attempts produce knowledge universal objective possible within realm human understanding45

jeremiah horrocks makes first observation transit venus 1639 imagined artist lavender 1903


contrast view science rests foundational assumptions coherentism asserts statements justified part coherent system rather individual statements cannot validated coherent systems justified53 prediction transit venus justified coherent broader beliefs celestial mechanics earlier observations explained observation cognitive relies preexisting understanding systematic beliefs observation transit venus requires huge range auxiliary beliefs describe optics telescopes mechanics telescope mount understanding celestial mechanics prediction fails transit observed likely occasion adjustment system change auxiliary assumption rather rejection theoretical systemcitation needed
