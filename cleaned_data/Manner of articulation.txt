closure strictureedit
greatest least stricture speech sounds classified along cline stop consonants occlusion blocked airflow fricative consonants partially blocked therefore strongly turbulent airflow approximants slight turbulence vowels full unimpeded airflow affricates often behave intermediate stops fricatives phonetically sequences stop fricative
time sounds language move along cline toward less stricture process called lenition towards stricture process called fortition
parametersedit
sibilants distinguished fricatives shape tongue airflow directed teeth fricatives coronal places articulation sibilant nonsibilant sibilants common
flaps also called taps similar brief stops however articulation behavior distinct enough considered separate manner rather length main articulatory difference flaps stops greater length stops compared flaps buildup pressure occurs behind stop occur behind flap means stop released burst pressure relieved flaps burst
trills involve vibration speech organs since trilling separate parameter stricture combined increasing stricture typical trill results trilled fricative trilled affricates also known
nasal airflow added independent parameter speech sound commonly found nasal occlusives nasal vowels nasalized fricatives taps approximants also found sound nasal called oral
laterality release airflow side tongue combined manners resulting lateral approximants pronunciation letter english word lateral flaps lateral fricatives affricates
individual mannersedit

stop oral occlusive occlusion blocking oral vocal tract nasal flow flow stops completely examples include english voiceless voiced consonant voiced voicing sound made occlusion voiceless stop completely silent hear effect onset occlusion preceding vowel well release burst effect following vowel shape position tongue place articulation determine resonant cavity gives different stops characteristic sounds languages stops
nasal nasal occlusive occlusion oral tract passes nose shape position tongue determine resonant cavity gives different nasals characteristic sounds examples include english nearly languages nasals exceptions area puget sound single language bougainville island
fricative sometimes called spirant continuous frication turbulent noisy airflow place articulation examples include english voiceless voiced languages fricatives though many however indigenous australian languages almost completely devoid fricatives kind




sibilants type fricative airflow guided groove tongue toward teeth creating highpitched distinctive sound common fricatives fricatives coronal front tongue places articulation usually though always sibilants english sibilants include






lateral fricatives rare type fricative frication occurs sides edge tongue welsh zulu lateral fricatives




affricate begins like stop releases fricative rather separate release english letters represent affricates affricates quite common around world though less common fricatives
flap often called momentary closure oral cavity utter udder pronounced flap north american australian english many linguists distinguish taps flaps consensus difference might language relies difference also lateral flaps
trill articulator usually tongue held place airstream causes vibrate double spanish perro trill trills flaps brief occlusions constitute class consonant called rhotics
approximant little obstruction examples include english languages spanish sounds seem fall fricative approximant




word semivowel sometimes called glide type approximant pronounced like vowel tongue closer roof mouth slight turbulence english semivowel equivalent vowel spelled semivowel equivalent vowel usage descriptions semivowel vowellike sounds syllabic increased stricture approximants found elements diphthongs word also used cover concepts term glide newer semivowel used indicate essential quality sounds movement glide initial position respectively following vowel






lateral approximants usually shortened lateral type approximant pronounced side tongue english lateral together rhotics similar behavior many languages form class consonant called liquids



broader classificationsedit




euler diagram showing typical classification sounds manners articulation phonological features


manners articulation substantial obstruction airflow stops fricatives affricates called obstruents prototypically voiceless voiced obstruents extremely common well manners without obstruction nasals liquids approximants also vowels called sonorantss nearly always voiced voiceless sonorants uncommon found welsh classical greek spelling standard tibetan lhasa dialects english distinguish witch
sonorants also called resonants linguists prefer term restricting word sonorant nonvocoid resonants nasals liquids vowels semivowels another common distinction occlusives stops nasals affricates continuants else
airstream initiationsedit
manners articulation pronounced airstream mechanism called pulmonic egressive meaning flows outward powered lungs actually ribs diaphragm airstream mechanisms possible sounds rely include

ejectives glottalic egressive airstream powered upward movement glottis rather lungs diaphragm stops affricates occasionally fricatives occur ejectives ejectives voiceless least transition voiced voiceless
implosives glottalic ingressive glottis moves downward lungs used simultaneously provide voicing languages actually flow mouth implosive stops uncommon implosive affricates fricatives rare voiceless implosives also rare
clicks lingual ingressive back tongue used create vacuum mouth causing rush forward occlusion tongue lips released clicks oral nasal stop affricate central lateral voiced voiceless extremely rare normal words outside southern africa however english click sound another often used giddy horse
combinations analyses single consonsant linguopulmonic linguoglottalic ejective consonants clicks released either pulmonic ejective stopfricative
