clinical immunology study diseases caused disorders immune system failure aberrant action malignant growth cellular elements system also involves diseases systems immune reactions play part pathology clinical features
diseases caused disorders immune system fall broad categories

immunodeficiency parts immune system fail provide adequate response examples include chronic granulomatous disease primary immune diseases
autoimmunity immune system attacks hosts body examples include systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis hashimotos disease myasthenia gravis

immune system disorders include various hypersensitivities asthma allergies respond inappropriately otherwise harmless compounds
wellknown disease affects immune system aids immunodeficiency characterized suppression helper cells dendritic cells macrophages human immunodeficiency virus
clinical immunologists also study ways prevent immune systems attempts destroy allografts transplant rejection
developmental immunologyedit
body’s capability react antigen depends persons antigen type maternal factors area antigen presented3 neonates said state physiological immunodeficiency innate adaptive immunological responses greatly suppressed born child’s immune system responds favorably protein antigens well glycoproteins polysaccharides fact many infections acquired neonates caused virulence organisms like staphylococcus pseudomonas neonates opsonic activity ability activate complement cascade limited example mean level newborn approximately found adult phagocytic activity also greatly impaired newborns lower opsonic activity well diminished upregulation integrin selectin receptors limit ability neutrophils interact adhesion molecules endothelium monocytes slow reduced production also limits newborns phagocytic activity although number total lymphocytes significantly higher adults cellular humoral immunity also impaired antigenpresenting cells newborns reduced capability activate cells also cells newborn proliferate poorly produce small amounts cytokines like il12 ifng limits capacity activate humoral response well phagocitic activity macrophage cells develop early gestation fully active4

maternal factors also play role body’s immune response birth immunoglobulin present maternal don’t cross placenta almost undetectable birth provided breast milk passivelyacquired antibodies protect newborn months response usually shortlived affinity4 antibodies also produce negative response child exposed antibody particular antigen exposed antigen child produce dampened response passively acquired maternal antibodies suppress antibody response active immunization similarly response tcells vaccination differs children compared adults vaccines induce responses adults readily elicit responses neonates4 nine months birth child’s immune system begins respond strongly glycoproteins usually marked improvement response polysaccharides least year reason distinct time frames found vaccination schedules56
adolescence human body undergoes various physical physiological immunological changes triggered mediated hormones significant females 17βoestradiol oestrogen males testosterone oestradiol usually begins around testosterone months later7 evidence steroids directly primary secondary sexual characteristics also effect development regulation immune system8 including increased risk developing pubescent postpubescent autoimmunity9 also evidence cell surface receptors cells macrophages detect hormones system10
female hormone 17βoestradiol shown regulate level immunological response11 male androgens testosterone seem suppress stress response infection androgens however dhea increase immune response12 females male hormones seem control immune system puberty postpuberty rest males adult life
physical changes puberty thymic involution also affect immunological response13
ecoimmunology behavioural immunityedit
main articles ecoimmunology behavioral immune system
ecoimmunology ecological immunology explores relationship immune system organism social biotic abiotic environment
recent ecoimmunological research focused host pathogen defences traditionally considered nonimmunological pathogen avoidance selfmedication symbiontmediated defenses fecundity tradeoffs14 behavioural immunity phrase coined mark schaller specifically refers psychological pathogen avoidance drivers disgust aroused stimuli encountered around pathogeninfected individuals smell vomit15 broadly behavioural ecological immunity demonstrated multiple species example monarch butterfly often lays eggs certain toxic milkweed species infected parasites toxins reduce parasite growth offspring infected monarch however uninfected monarch butterflies forced feed toxic plants suffer fitness cost reduced lifespan relative uninfected monarch butterflies16 indicates laying eggs toxic plants costly behaviour monarchs probably evolved reduce severity parasite infection14
symbiontmediated defenses also heritable across host generations despite nongenetic direct basis transmission aphids example rely several different symbionts defense parasites vertically transmit symbionts parent offspring17 therefore symbiont successfully confers protection parasite likely passed host offspring allowing coevolution parasites attacking host similar traditional immunity

theoretical immunologyedit
