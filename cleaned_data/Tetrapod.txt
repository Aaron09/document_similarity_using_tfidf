classification tetrapods long history traditionally tetrapods divided four classes based gross anatomical physiological traits48 snakes legless reptiles considered tetrapods sufficiently like reptiles full complement limbs similar considerations apply caecilians aquatic mammals newer taxonomy frequently based cladistics instead giving variable number major branches clades tetrapod family tree
case throughout evolutionary biology today debate properly classify groups within tetrapoda traditional biological classification sometimes fails recognize evolutionary transitions older groups descendant groups markedly different characteristics example birds evolved dinosaurs defined separate group represent distinct type physical form functionality phylogenetic nomenclature contrast newer group always included school taxonomy dinosaurs birds groups contrast rather birds subtype dinosaurs
history classificationedit
tetrapods including large mediumsized land animals among best understood animals since earliest times aristotles time basic division mammals birds egglaying tetrapods herptiles well known inclusion legless snakes group likewise recognized49 birth modern biological classification 18th century linnaeus used division tetrapods occupying first three classes animals50 reptiles amphibians quite similar externally french zoologist pierre andré latreille recognized large physiological differences beginning 19th century split herptiles classes giving four familiar classes tetrapods amphibians reptiles birds mammals51
