usageedit
data structures implement particular abstract data types specify operations performed data structure computational complexity operations comparison data structure concrete implementation space provided adtcitation needed
different kinds data structures suited different kinds applications highly specialized specific tasks example relational databases commonly btree indexes data retrieval5 compiler implementations usually hash tables look identifierscitation needed
data structures provide means manage large amounts data efficiently uses large databases internet indexing services usually efficient data structures designing efficient algorithms formal design methods programming languages emphasize data structures rather algorithms organizing factor software design data structures used organize storage retrieval information stored main memory secondary memorycitation needed
implementationedit
data structures generally based ability computer fetch store data place memory specified pointer—a string representing memory address stored memory manipulated program thus array record data structures based computing addresses data items arithmetic operations linked data structures based storing addresses data items within structure many data structures principles sometimes combined nontrivial ways linkingcitation needed
implementation data structure usually requires writing procedures create manipulate instances structure efficiency data structure cannot analyzed separately operations observation motivates theoretical concept abstract data type data structure defined indirectly operations performed mathematical properties operations including space time costcitation needed
examplesedit
main article list data structures
numerous types data structures generally built upon simpler primitive data typescitation needed

array number elements specific order typically type elements accessed using integer index specify element required depending language individual elements either forced type almost type typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words elements arrays always necessity arrays fixedlength resizable
linked list also called list linear collection data elements type called nodes node value points next node linked list principal advantage linked list array values always efficiently inserted removed without relocating rest list certain operations random access certain element however slower lists arrays
record also called tuple struct aggregate data structure record value contains values typically fixed number sequence typically indexed names elements records usually called fields members
union data structure specifies number permitted primitive types stored instances float long integer contrast record could defined contain float integer whereas union value time enough space allocated contain widest member datatype
tagged union also called variant variant record discriminated union disjoint union contains additional field indicating current type enhanced type safety
class data structure contains data fields like record well various methods operate contents record context objectoriented programming records known plain data structures distinguish classescitation needed

language supportedit
assembly languages lowlevel languages bcpl basic combined programming language lack builtin support data structures hand many highlevel programming languages higherlevel assembly languages masm special syntax builtin support certain data structures records arrays example direct descendant bcpl pascal languages support structs records respectively addition vectors onedimensional arrays multidimensional arrays67
programming languages feature sort library mechanism allows data structure implementations reused different programs modern languages usually come standard libraries implement common data structures examples standard template library java collections framework microsoft frameworkcitation needed
modern languages also generally support modular programming separation interface library module implementation provide opaque data types allow clients hide implementation details objectoriented programming languages java smalltalk typically classes purpose
many known data structures concurrent versions allow multiple computing threads access single concrete instance data structure simultaneouslycitation needed
