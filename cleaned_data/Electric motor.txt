electromagnetic motors includes types mentioned derive torque vector product interacting fields calculating torque necessary know fields established mathematical analysis using tools torque calculated integral vectors force multiplied radius vector current flowing winding producing fields motor using magnetic material field linearly proportional current makes calculation difficult computer many calculations needed
done figure relating current torque used useful parameter motor selection maximum torque motor depend maximum current although usually usable thermal considerations take precedence
optimally designed within given core saturation constraint given active current torque current voltage polepair number excitation frequency synchronous speed airgap flux density categories electric motors generators exhibit virtually maximum continuous shaft torque operating torque within given airgap area winding slots backiron depth determines physical size electromagnetic core applications require bursts torque beyond maximum operating torque short bursts torque accelerate electric vehicle standstill always limited magnetic core saturation safe operating temperature rise voltage capacity torque bursts beyond maximum operating torque differs significantly categories electric motors generators
capacity bursts torque confused field weakening capability field weakening allows electric machine operate beyond designed frequency excitation field weakening done maximum speed cannot reached increasing applied voltage applies motors current controlled fields therefore cannot achieved motors
electric machines without transformer circuit topology wrsms pmsms cannot realize bursts torque higher maximum designed torque without saturating magnetic core rendering increase current useless furthermore assembly pmsms irreparably damaged bursts torque exceeding maximum operating torque rating attempted
electric machines transformer circuit topology induction machines induction doublyfed electric machines induction synchronous woundrotor doublyfed wrdf machines exhibit high bursts torque emfinduced active current either side transformer oppose thus contribute nothing transformer coupled magnetic core flux density would otherwise lead core saturation
