subjectverb agreement subject agrees finite verb person number






position occupied subject typically immediately precedes finite verb declarative clauses english laughs






semantic role typical subject active voice agent theme performs action expressed verb theme receives property assigned predicate



three criteria first agreement reliable subject english many languages agrees finite verb person number sometimes gender well second third criterion merely strong tendencies flouted certain constructions



studying chemistry three criteria agree identifying subject






studying chemistry criteria identify subject






chemistry studied criteria identify chemistry subject



first sentence three criteria combine identify subject second sentence involves subjectauxiliary inversion yesnoquestion subject immediately follows finite verb instead immediately preceding means second criterion flouted third sentence expressed passive voice criterion combine identify chemistry subject whereas third criterion suggests subject agent
criteria identifying subjectsedit
criteria identifying subjects helpful many languages english



morphological case languages case systems subject marked specific case often nominative






omission many languages systematically omit subject known discourse



fourth criterion applicable english english largely lacks morphological case exception subject object forms pronouns hehim sheher theythem fifth criterion helpful languages typically drop pronominal subjects spanish portuguese italian latin greek japanese mandarin though languages rich verb forms determining person number subject japanese mandarin forms dropping pattern automatically make language prodrop language languages like english french clauses subject either noun phrase pronoun clause also true clause element represented verbs like rain must subject even nothing actually represented case expletive dummy pronoun imperative clauses languages elide subject even english typically requires subject present

difficult casesedit
certain constructions challenge criteria introduced identifying subjects following subsections briefly illustrate three cases english existential thereconstructions inverse copular constructions locative inversion constructions
existential thereconstructionsedit
existential thereconstructions allow varying interpretations count subject

sentence first criterion agreement second criterion position occupied suggest subject whereas third criterion semantic role suggests rather problems subject sentence contrast agreement semantic role suggest problems subject whereas position occupied suggests subject cases take first criterion telling subject agree finite verb8
inverse copular constructionsedit
another difficult case identifying subject socalled inverse copular construction



boys chaotic force around






chaotic force around boys inverse copular construction



criteria combine identify boys subject sentence case might argue boys also subject similar sentence even though criteria agreement position occupied suggest chaotic force around subject confronted data make decision less fully arbitrary assumes criterion agreement reliable usually identify subject
locative inversion constructionsedit
another type construction challenges subject concept locative inversion



spiders breeding






breeding spiders locative inversion






breeding spiders failed attempt question location






spiders breeding successful attempt question location



criteria easily identify spiders subject sentence sentence however position occupied suggests construed subject whereas agreement semantic role continue identify spiders subject despite fact spiders sentence appears string verbs canonical position object fact sentence sentence good reveals something unusual indeed afoot since attempt question location fails subject immediately follow finite verb observation speaks taking spiders subject sentence spiders subject sentence must lack subject entirely supposed possible english
subjectless clausesedit
existence subjectless clauses construed particularly problematic theories sentence structure build binary subjectpredicate division simple sentence defined combination subject predicate subject present sentence subjectless clauses absent english part unusual related languages german instance impersonal passive clauses lack recognizable subject






gestern
wurde

geschlafen



yesterday


slept
everybody slept yesterday






word gestern yesterday generally construed adverb means cannot taken subject sentence certain verbs german also require dative accusative object instead nominative subject







graut
davor



medat
uneasy

uneasy






since subjects typically marked nominative case german fourth criterion argue sentence lacks subject relevant verb argument appears dative case nominative
subjects sentence structureedit
subject receives privileged status theories sentence structure approaches acknowledge binary division clause subject predicate case phrase structure grammars subject usually immediate dependent root node whereby sister predicate object contrast appears lower structure dependent thea verb eg10







subjects indicated using blue objects using orange special status subject visible insofar subject higher tree time object theories syntax reject initial division case dependency grammars subject nevertheless also granted privileged status insofar immediate dependent finite verb following trees dependency grammar11







subject dependent root node finite verb trees object contrast appears lower second tree dependent nonfinite verb subject remains dependent finite verb subjectauxiliary inversion occurs







prominence subject consistently reflected position tree immediate dependent root word finite verb
