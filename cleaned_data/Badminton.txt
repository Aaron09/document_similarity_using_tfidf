badminton racquets


badminton rules restrict design size racquets shuttlecocks
racquets
badminton racquets lightweight quality racquets weighing grams ounces including grip strings1314 composed many different materials ranging carbon fibre composite graphite reinforced plastic solid steel augmented variety materials carbon fibre excellent strength weight ratio stiff gives excellent kinetic energy transfer adoption carbon fibre composite racquets made light metals aluminum earlier still racquets made wood cheap racquets still often made metals steel wooden racquets longer manufactured ordinary market excessive mass cost nowadays nanomaterials fullerene carbon nanotubes added racquets giving greater durabilitycitation needed
wide variety racquet designs although laws limit racquet size shape different racquets playing characteristics appeal different players traditional oval head shape still available isometric head shape increasingly common racquets
strings
badminton strings thin high performing strings thicknesses ranging thicker strings durable many players prefer feel thinner strings string tension normally range recreational players generally string lower tensions professionals typically professionals string string manufacturers measure thickness strings tension actually thicker specified slack ashaway micropower actually 07mm yonex bg66 072mm
often argued high string tensions improve control whereas string tensions increase power15 arguments generally rely crude mechanical reasoning claiming lower tension string bouncy therefore provides power fact incorrect higher string tension cause shuttle slide racquet hence make harder shot accurately alternative view suggests optimum tension power depends player13 faster accurately player swing racquet higher tension maximum power neither view subjected rigorous mechanical analysis clear evidence favour effective player find good string tension experiment
grip
choice grip allows player increase thickness racquet handle choose comfortable surface hold player build handle several grips applying final layer
players choose variety grip materials common choices synthetic grips towelling grips grip choice matter personal preference players often find sweat becomes problem case drying agent applied grip hands sweatbands used player choose another grip material change hisher grip frequently
main types grip replacement grips overgrips replacement grips thicker often used increase size handle overgrips thinner less often used final layer many players however prefer replacement grips final layer towelling grips always replacement grips replacement grips adhesive backing whereas overgrips small patch adhesive start tape must applied tension overgrips convenient players change grips frequently removed rapidly without damaging underlying material
shuttlecock

shuttlecocks feathers




main article shuttlecock
shuttlecock often abbreviated shuttle also called birdie highdrag projectile open conical shape cone formed sixteen overlapping feathers embedded rounded cork base cork covered thin leather synthetic material synthetic shuttles often used recreational players reduce costs feathered shuttles break easily nylon shuttles constructed either natural cork synthetic foam base plastic skirt
badminton rules also provide testing shuttlecock correct speed

test shuttlecock full underhand stroke makes contact shuttlecock back boundary line shuttlecock shall upward angle direction parallel side lines
shuttlecock correct speed land less short back boundary line

shoes
badminton shoes lightweight soles rubber similar highgrip nonmarking materials
compared running shoes badminton shoes little lateral support high levels lateral support useful activities lateral motion undesirable unexpected badminton however requires powerful lateral movements highly builtup lateral support able protect foot badminton instead encourage catastrophic collapse point shoes support fails players ankles ready sudden loading cause sprains reason players choose badminton shoes rather general trainers running shoes proper badminton shoes thin sole lower persons centre gravity therefore result fewer injuries players also ensure learn safe proper footwork knee foot alignment lunges safety concern proper footwork also critical order move effectively around court

strokes
badminton offers wide variety basic strokes players require high level skill perform effectively strokes played either forehand backhand players forehand side side playing hand righthanded player forehand side right side backhand side left side forehand strokes front hand leading like hitting palm whereas backhand strokes back hand leading like hitting knuckles players frequently play certain strokes forehand side backhand hitting action vice versa
forecourt midcourt strokes played equally effectively either forehand backhand side rear court players attempt play many strokes possible forehands often preferring play roundthehead forehand overhead forehand backhand side rather attempt backhand overhead playing backhand overhead main disadvantages first player must turn back opponents restricting view court second backhand overheads cannot much power forehands hitting action limited shoulder joint permits much greater range movement forehand overhead backhand backhand clear considered players coaches difficult basic stroke game since precise technique needed order muster enough power shuttlecock travel full length court reason backhand smashes tend weak
position shuttlecock receiving player




player forehand service 2009 philadelphia


choice stroke depends near shuttlecock whether height opponent currently positioned players much better attacking options reach shuttlecock well height especially also close forecourt high shuttlecock kill hitting steeply downwards attempting rally immediately best drop shuttlecock situation midcourt high shuttlecock usually powerful smash also hitting downwards hoping outright winner weak reply athletic jump smashes players jump upwards steeper smash angle common spectacular element elite mens doubles play rearcourt players strive shuttlecock still rather allowing drop lower overhead hitting allows play smashes clears hitting shuttlecock high back opponents court drop shots hitting shuttlecock softly falls sharply downwards opponents forecourt shuttlecock dropped lower smash impossible fulllength high clear difficult
vertical position shuttlecock




player prepares vertical jump smash


shuttlecock well height players choice upwards lifts shuttlecock upwards back opponents court played parts court player lift remaining option push shuttlecock softly back forecourt called netshot midcourt rearcourt often called push block
shuttlecock near height players drives travel flat rapidly opponents rear midcourt rearcourt pushes also flatter placing shuttlecock front midcourt drives pushes played midcourt forecourt often used doubles attempt regain attack rather choosing lift shuttlecock defend smashes successful drive push opponents often forced lift shuttlecock
spin
balls spun alter bounce example topspin backspin tennis trajectory players slice ball strike angled racquet face produce spin shuttlecock allowed bounce slicing shuttlecock applications badminton basic strokes explanation technical terms

slicing shuttlecock side cause travel different direction direction suggested players racquet body movement used deceive opponents
slicing shuttlecock side cause follow slightly curved path seen deceleration imparted spin causes sliced strokes slow suddenly towards flight path used create dropshots smashes steeply pass
playing netshot slicing underneath shuttlecock cause turn tumble several times passes called spinning netshot tumbling netshot opponent unwilling address shuttlecock corrected orientation

feathers overlap shuttlecock also slight natural spin axis rotational symmetry spin counterclockwise direction seen dropping shuttlecock natural spin affects certain strokes tumbling netshot effective slicing action right left rather left right16
biomechanics
badminton biomechanics subject extensive scientific study studies confirm minor role wrist power generation indicate major contributions power come internal external rotations upper lower arm17 recent guides sport thus emphasize forearm rotation rather wrist movements18
feathers impart substantial drag causing shuttlecock decelerate greatly distance shuttlecock also extremely aerodynamically stable regardless initial orientation turn corkfirst remain corkfirst orientation
consequence shuttlecocks drag requires considerable power full length court case racquet sports drag also influences flight path lifted lobbed shuttlecock parabola flight heavily skewed falls steeper angle rises high serves shuttlecock even fall vertically
factors
defending smash players three basic options lift block drive singles block common reply doubles lift safest option usually allows opponents continue smashing blocks drives counterattacking strokes intercepted smashers partner many players backhand hitting action returning smashes forehand backhand sides backhands effective forehands covering smashes directed body hard shots directed towards body difficult defend
service restricted laws presents array stroke choices unlike tennis servers racquet must pointing downward direction deliver serve normally shuttle must upwards pass server choose serve forecourt like push lift back service court flat drive serve lifted serves either high serves shuttlecock lifted high falls almost vertically back court flick serves shuttlecock lifted lesser height falls sooner
deception
players mastered basic strokes shuttlecock part court powerfully softly required beyond basics however badminton offers rich potential advanced stroke skills provide competitive advantage badminton players cover short distance quickly possible purpose many advanced strokes deceive opponent either tricked believing different stroke played forced delay movement actually sees shuttles direction deception badminton often used senses player genuinely deceived often lose point immediately cannot change direction quickly enough reach shuttlecock experienced players aware trick cautious move early attempted deception still useful forces opponent delay movement slightly weaker players whose intended strokes obvious experienced player move shuttlecock anticipating stroke gain advantage
slicing using shortened hitting action main technical devices facilitate deception slicing involves hitting shuttlecock angled racquet face causing travel different direction suggested body movement slicing also causes shuttlecock travel slowly movement suggests example good crosscourt sliced dropshot hitting action suggests straight clear smash deceiving opponent power direction shuttlecock sophisticated slicing action involves brushing strings around shuttlecock order make shuttlecock spin used improve shuttles trajectory making rapidly passes example sliced serve travel slightly faster normal serve land spot spinning shuttlecock also used create spinning netshots also called tumbling netshots shuttlecock turns several times tumbles stabilizing sometimes shuttlecock remains inverted instead tumbling main advantage spinning netshot opponent unwilling address shuttlecock stopped tumbling since hitting feathers result unpredictable stroke spinning netshots especially important high level singles players
lightness modern racquets allows players short hitting action many strokes thereby maintaining option powerful soft stroke last possible moment example singles player hold racquet ready netshot flick shuttlecock back instead shallow lift notices opponent moved actual shot played shallow lift takes less time reach ground mentioned rally shuttlecock touches ground makes opponents task covering whole court much difficult lift higher bigger obvious swing short hitting action useful deception also allows player powerful strokes time swing swing also usually advised badminton bigger swings make difficult recover next shot fast exchanges grip tightening crucial techniques often described finger power elite players develop finger power extent power strokes kills less centimetres inches racquet swing
also possible reverse style deception suggesting powerful stroke slowing hitting action play soft stroke general latter style deception common rearcourt example dropshots disguised smashes whereas former style common forecourt midcourt example lifts disguised netshots
deception limited slicing short hitting actions players also double motion make initial racquet movement direction withdrawing racquet another direction players often send opponents wrong direction racquet movement typically used suggest straight angle play stroke cross court vice versa triple motion also possible rare actual play alternative double motion racquet head fake initial motion continued racquet turned produces smaller change direction require much time
strategy

badminton players need employ wide variety strokes right situations range powerful jumping smashes delicate tumbling returns often rallies finish smash setting smash requires subtler strokes example netshot force opponent lift shuttlecock gives opportunity smash netshot tight tumbling opponents lift reach back court makes subsequent smash much harder return
deception also important expert players prepare many different strokes look identical slicing deceive opponents speed direction stroke opponent tries anticipate stroke move wrong direction unable change body momentum time reach shuttlecock
singles
since person needs cover entire court singles tactics based forcing opponent move much possible means singles strokes normally directed corners court players exploit length court combining lifts clears drop shots shots smashing tends less prominent singles doubles smasher partner follow effort thus vulnerable skillfully placed return moreover frequent smashing exhausting singles conservation players energy premium however players strong smashes sometimes shot create openings players commonly smash weak returns rallies
singles players often start rally forehand high serve flick serve serves also used frequently either forehand backhand drive serves rare
high levels play singles demands extraordinary fitness singles game patient positional manoeuvring unlike allout aggression doubles19
doubles
pairs gain maintain attack smashing downwards opportunity arises whenever possible pair adopt ideal attacking formation player hitting rearcourt partner midcourt intercepting smash returns except lift rearcourt attacker plays dropshot partner move forecourt threaten reply pair cannot downwards flat strokes attempt gain attack pair forced lift clear shuttlecock must defend adopt sidebyside position rear midcourt cover full width court opponents smashes doubles players generally smash middle ground players order take advantage confusion clashes
high levels play backhand serve become popular extent forehand serves become fairly rare high level play straight serve used frequently attempt prevent opponents gaining attack immediately flick serves used prevent opponent anticipating serve attacking decisively
high levels play doubles rallies extremely fast mens doubles aggressive form badminton high proportion powerful jump smashes quick reflex exchanges spectator interest sometimes greater mens doubles singles
mixed doubles




mixed doubles game scottish schools tournament tranent 2002


mixed doubles pairs typically maintain attacking formation woman front back male players usually substantially stronger therefore produce smashes powerful result mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness subtler positional play clever opponents reverse ideal position forcing woman towards back towards front order protect danger mixed players must careful systematic shot selection20
high levels play formations generally flexible women players capable playing powerfully backcourt happily required opportunity arises however pair switch back standard mixed attacking position woman front back
