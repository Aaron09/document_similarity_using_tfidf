surface runoffedit
overland flow erode soil particles transport downslope erosion associated overland flow occur different methods depending meteorological flow conditions

initial impact rain droplets dislodges soil phenomenon called rainsplash erosion
overland flow directly responsible sediment entrainment form gullies called sheet erosion
flow substrate permit channelization gullies form termed gully erosion

fluvial depositional environmentsedit
