universal polar stereographic coordinate system used conjunction universal transverse mercator coordinate system locate positions surface earth like coordinate system coordinate system uses metricbased cartesian grid laid conformally projected surface covers earths polar regions specifically areas north 84°n south 80°s covered grids plus additional minutes latitude extending grid provide overlap systems
polar regions directions become complicated geographic north–south lines converging poles difference grid north true north therefore anything 180°—in places grid north true south vice versa grid north arbitrarily defined along prime meridian antarctic 180th meridian arctic thus east west grids moving directly away pole along 90°e 90°w meridians respectively
