scyphozoa sometimes called true jellyfish though truly jellyfish others listed tetraradial symmetry tentacles around outer margin bowlshaped bell long oral arms around mouth center subumbrella
cubozoa jellyfish rounded boxshaped bell velarium assists swim quickly jellyfish related closely scyphozoan jellyfish either hydrozoa39
hydrozoa medusae also tetraradial symmetry nearly always velum attached inside bell margin oral arms much smaller central manubrium terminal mouth opening distinguished absence cells mesoglea majority hydrozoan species maintain polyp form entire life cycle form medusa hydra hence considered jellyfish
staurozoa stalked jellyfish characterized medusa form generally sessile oriented upside stalk emerging apex calyx bell attaches substrate staurozoa known also polyp form alternates medusoid portion life cycle recently staurozoa classified within scyphozoa

developmental stages scyphozoan jellyfishs life cycle
larva searches site
polyp grows
9–11 polyp strobilates
12–14 medusa grows


phases
jellyfish development occurs multiple phases sperm fertilize eggs develop larval planulae become polyps ephyrae transform adult medusae species specimens skip phases51
planula small larva covered cilia settles onto firm surface develops polyp
polyp generally small stalk mouth ringed upwardfacing tentacles polyps resemble closely related cnidaria anthozoan anemones corals polyps jellyfish polyp sessile living bottom another substrate floats boat hulls freefloating attached tiny bits freeliving plankton52 rarely fish5354 invertebrates polyps solitary colonial polyp colonies form strobilation multiple polyps share common stomach cavity55 polyps millimeters size feed continuously polyp stage last years
next stage ephyra freeswimming precursor final adult stage
ephyra develops medusa medusa life stage typically identified jellyfish56
reproduction
jellyfish reproduce sexually asexually upon reaching adult size jellyfish spawn daily given enough food species spawning controlled light entire population spawns time often either dusk dawn57 jellyfish usually either male female occasional hermaphrodites cases adults release sperm eggs surrounding water unprotected eggs fertilized mature organisms
growth interval polyp begins reproducing asexually budding scyphozoa called segmenting polyp scyphistoma budding produces scyphistomae also ephyrae budding sites vary species tentacle bulbs manubrium mouth gonads hydromedusae52 polyps asexually produce freeswimming ephyra become medusa specimens usually millimeter across swim away polyp grow polyps asexually produce creeping frustule larval form develops another polypcitation needed
species produce medusae budding directly medusan stage hydromedusae reproduce fission splitting half52 omit planula polyp ephyra phases produce medusae directly eggscitation needed
species sperm swim females mouth fertilizing eggs within body remain early development stages moon jellies eggs lodge pits oral arms form temporary brood chamber developing planula larvae
lifespan
jellyfish lifespans typically range hours case small hydromedusae several months indications deep species live order years life span varies species large coastal jellyfish live months grow millimeter many centimeters diameter
aquarium jellyfish carefully tended daily even food might seasonally rare wild sometimes treated antibiotics develop infections live several years though would unusual wild
unusual species turritopsis dohrnii formerly classified nutricula58 might effectively immortal ability certain circumstances transform medusa back polyp stage thereby escaping death typically awaits medusae postreproduction otherwise eaten ocean organism reversal observed laboratory59 least professor seto marine biological laboratory kyoto university japan concluded three species jellyfish immortal says immortality hold immortality human beings says genetically much different humans60
movement
jellyfish proven energy efficient swimmers animals61 move water radially expanding contracting bellshaped bodies push water behind pause contraction expansion create vortex rings muscles used contraction body sheds first vortex pushes animal forward mesoglea elastic expansion powered exclusively relaxing bell releases energy stored contraction second vortex ring rolls begins spin faster sucks water refills bell pushed centre body giving secondary free boost forward mechanism called passive energy recapture works speeds relatively small body sizes allowing animal travel percent farther swimming cycle jellyfish achieved percent lower cost transport amount food oxygen consumed versus energy spent movement animals similar studies626364

diet
medusae carnivorous feeding plankton crustaceans fish eggs small fish jellyfish ingesting voiding hole middle bell jellies hunt passively using tentacles drift nets swimming technique also helps capture prey body expands displaces water brings potential prey within reach tentacles66
predation
species jellyfish among common important jellyfish predators specialize jellies anemones jellyfish drift range predators include tunas sharks swordfish turtles penguins6768 least species pacific salmon general however predators preying jellyfish considered predators food chain fish eggs juvenile fish also compete food resources leading jellyfish difficulttoreverse dominant position ecosystem69
birds sometimes pick symbiotic crustaceans jellyfish bells near seas surface inevitably feeding also jellyfish hosts amphipods young crabs shrimp
blooms
jellyfish bloom formation complex process depends ocean currents nutrients sunshine temperature season prey availability reduced predation oxygen concentrations ocean currents tend congregate jellyfish large swarms blooms consisting hundreds thousands individuals blooms also result unusually high populations years recent study tracking swimming jellyfish revealed medusae detect marine currents swim current congregate blooms70 jellyfish better able survive nutrientrich oxygenpoor water competitors thus feast plankton without competition jellyfish also benefit saltier waters saltier waters contain iodine necessary polyps turn jellyfish rising temperatures caused climate change also contribute jellyfish blooms many species jellyfish relatively better able survive warmer waters71
hypothesis global increase jellyfish bloom frequency stem human impact locations jellyfish filling ecological niches formerly occupied overfished creatures hypothesis lacks supporting data17 youngbluth states jellyfish feed kinds prey adult young fish fish removed equation jellyfish likely move in72
jellyfish populations shown clear increases past decades invasive species newly arrived habitats examples include black caspian baltic central eastern mediterranean hawaii tropical subtropical parts west atlantic including caribbean gulf mexico brazil7374 invasive populations expand rapidly often face predators habitat
increased nutrients ascribed agricultural runoff cited contributing jellyfish proliferation graham states ecosystems high levels nutrients provide nourishment small organisms jellyfish feed waters eutrophication oxygen levels often result favoring jellyfish thrive less oxygenrich water fish tolerate fact jellyfish increasing symptom something happening ecosystem72

also fishing food
jellyfish populations expanding globally result overfishing natural predators availability excessive nutrients land runoff7576 marine ecosystems become disturbed jellyfish proliferate example jellyfish reproduce rapidly fast growth rates predate many species species predate feed touch rather visually feed effectively night turbid waters7778 become difficult fish stocks reestablish marine ecosystems become dominated jellyfish jellyfish feed plankton includes fish eggs larvae7980
