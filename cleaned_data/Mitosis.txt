interphaseedit
main article interphase
mitotic phase relatively short period cell cycle alternates much longer interphase cell prepares process cell division interphase divided three phases first synthesis second three parts interphase cell grows producing proteins cytoplasmic organelles however chromosomes replicated phase thus cell grows continues grow duplicates chromosomes grows prepares mitosis finally divides restarting cycle15 phases cell cycle highly regulated cyclins cyclindependent kinases cell cycle proteins phases follow another strict order checkpoints give cell cues proceed phase another cells also temporarily permanently leave cell cycle enter phase stop dividing occur cells become overcrowded densitydependent inhibition differentiate carry specific functions organism case human heart muscle cells neurons cells ability reenter cell cycle
mitosisedit
preprophase plant cellsedit
main article preprophase
plant cells prophase preceded preprophase stage highly vacuolated plant cells nucleus migrate center cell mitosis begin achieved formation phragmosome transverse sheet cytoplasm bisects cell along future plane cell division addition phragmosome formation preprophase characterized formation ring microtubules actin filaments called preprophase band underneath plasma membrane around equatorial plane future mitotic spindle band marks position cell eventually divide cells higher plants flowering plants lack centrioles instead microtubules form spindle surface nucleus organized spindle chromosomes nuclear envelope breaks down17 preprophase band disappears nuclear envelope breakdown spindle formation prometaphase1858–67
prophaseedit
main article prophase
prophase occurs interphase cell prepares divide tightly condensing chromosomes initiating mitotic spindle formation interphase genetic material nucleus consists loosely packed chromatin onset prophase chromatin fibers condense discrete chromosomes typically visible high magnification light microscope stage chromosomes long thin threadlike chromosome chromatids chromatids joined centromere
gene transcription ceases prophase resume late anaphase early phase192021 nucleolus also disappears early prophase22




condensing chromosomes interphase nucleus left condensing chromosomes middle condensed chromosomes right


close nucleus animal cells structures called centrosomes consisting pair centrioles surrounded loose collection proteins centrosome coordinating center cells microtubules cell inherits single centrosome cell division duplicated cell round mitosis begins giving pair centrosomes centrosomes polymerize tubulin help form microtubule spindle apparatus motor proteins push centrosomes along microtubules opposite sides cell although centrosomes help organize microtubule assembly essential formation spindle apparatus since absent plants17 absolutely required animal cell mitosis23
prometaphaseedit
main article prometaphase
beginning prometaphase animal cells phosphorylation nuclear lamins causes nuclear envelope disintegrate small membrane vesicles happens microtubules invade nuclear space called open mitosis occurs multicellular organisms fungi protists algae trichomonads undergo variation called closed mitosis spindle forms inside nucleus microtubules penetrate intact nuclear envelope2425
late prometaphase kinetochore microtubules begin search attach chromosomal kinetochores26 kinetochore proteinaceous microtubulebinding structure forms chromosomal centromere late prophase2627 number polar microtubules find interact corresponding polar microtubules opposite centrosome form mitotic spindle28 although kinetochore structure function fully understood known contains form molecular motor29 microtubule connects kinetochore motor activates using energy crawl tube toward originating centrosome motor activity coupled polymerisation depolymerisation microtubules provides pulling force necessary later separate chromosomes chromatids29
metaphaseedit




cell late metaphase chromosomes blue arrived metaphase plate


main article metaphase
microtubules located attached kinetochores prometaphase centrosomes begin pulling chromosomes towards opposite ends cell resulting tension causes chromosomes align along metaphase plate equatorial plane imaginary line centrally located centrosomes approximately midline cell28 ensure equitable distribution chromosomes mitosis metaphase checkpoint guarantees kinetochores properly attached mitotic spindle chromosomes aligned along metaphase plate30 cell successfully passes metaphase checkpoint proceeds anaphase
anaphaseedit
main article anaphase
anaphase cohesins bind sister chromatids together cleaved forming identical daughter chromosomes31 shortening kinetochore microtubules pulls newly formed daughter chromosomes opposite ends cell anaphase polar microtubules push causing cell elongate32 late anaphase chromosomes also reach overall maximal condensation level help chromosome segregation reformation nucleus33 animal cells anaphase precedes anaphase vertebrate cells demonstrate opposite order events31
telophaseedit
main article telophase
telophase greek word τελος meaning reversal prophase prometaphase events telophase polar microtubules continue lengthen elongating cell even nuclear envelope broken nuclear envelope forms using membrane vesicles parent cells nuclear envelope envelope forms around separated daughter chromosomes though membrane enclose centrosomes nucleolus reappears sets chromosomes surrounded nuclear membrane begin relax decondense mitosis complete daughter nucleus identical chromosomes cell division occur time depending organism
cytokinesisedit




cilliate undergoing cytokinesis cleavage furrow clearly visible


main article cytokinesis
cytokinesis phase mitosis rather separate process necessary completing cell division animal cells cleavage furrow pinch containing contractile ring develops metaphase plate used pinching separated nuclei34 animal plant cells cell division also driven vesicles derived golgi apparatus move along microtubules middle cell35 plants structure coalesces cell plate center phragmoplast develops cell wall separating nuclei phragmoplast microtubule structure typical higher plants whereas green algae phycoplast microtubule array cytokinesis1864–7 328–9 daughter cell complete copy genome parent cell cytokinesis marks mphase
many cells mitosis cytokinesis occur separately forming single cells multiple nuclei notable occurrence among fungi slime molds coenocytic algae phenomenon found various organisms even animals cytokinesis mitosis occur independently instance certain stages fruit embryonic development36
significanceedit
mitosis important maintenance chromosomal cell formed receives chromosomes alike composition equal number chromosomes parent cell
mitosis occurs following circumstances

development growth
number cells within organism increases mitosis basis development multicellular body single cell zygote also basis growth multicellular body
cell replacement
parts body skin digestive tract cells constantly sloughed replaced ones cells formed mitosis exact copies cells replaced like manner blood cells short lifespan months rbcs formed mitosis
regeneration
organisms regenerate body parts production cells instances achieved mitosis example starfish regenerate lost arms mitosis
asexual reproduction
organisms produce genetically similar offspring asexual reproduction example hydra reproduces asexually budding cells surface hydra undergo mitosis form mass called mitosis continues cells grows individual division happens asexual reproduction vegetative propagation plants
