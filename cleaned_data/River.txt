river begins source often several sources follows path called course ends mouth mouths water river usually confined channel made stream banks larger rivers often also wider floodplain shaped floodwaters overtopping channel floodplains wide relation size river channel distinction river channel floodplain blurred especially urban areas floodplain river channel become greatly developed housing industry
rivers flow mountains valleys depressions along plains create canyons gorges
term upriver upstream refers direction towards source river direction flow likewise term downriver downstream describes direction towards mouth river current flows
term left bank refers left bank direction flow right bank right
river channel typically contains single stream water rivers flow several interconnecting streams water producing braided river4 extensive braided rivers found regions worldwidecitation needed south island zealand also occur peneplains larger river deltas anastamosing rivers similar braided rivers quite rare multiple sinuous channels carrying large volumes sediment rare cases river bifurcation river divides resultant flows ending different seas example bifurcation nerodime river kosovo

rivers classified many criteria including topography biotic status relevance white water rafting canoeing activities
topographical classification
rivers generally classified either alluvial bedrock alluvial rivers channels floodplains selfformed unconsolidated weakly consolidated sediments erode banks deposit material bars floodplains bedrock rivers form river downcuts modern sediments underlying bedrock occurs regions experienced kind uplift thereby steepening river gradients particular hard lithology causes river steepened reach covered modern alluvium bedrock rivers often contain alluvium beds material important eroding sculpting channel rivers patches bedrock patches deep alluvial cover classified mixed bedrockalluvial
alluvial rivers classified channel pattern meandering braided wandering anastomose straight morphology alluvial river reach controlled combination sediment supply substrate composition discharge vegetation aggradation
start 20th century william morris davis devised cycle erosion method classifying rivers based although daviss system still found many books today 1950s 1960s became increasingly criticized rejected geomorphologists scheme produce testable hypotheses therefore deemed nonscientific8 examples daviss river ages include

youthful river river steep gradient tributaries flows quickly channels erode deeper rather wider examples brazos trinity ebro rivers
mature river river gradient less steep youthful rivers flows slowly mature river many tributaries discharge youthful river channels erode wider rather deeper examples mississippi saint lawrence danube ohio thames paraná rivers
river river gradient erosive energy rivers characterized flood plains examples yellow lower ganges tigris euphrates indus lower nile rivers
rejuvenated river river gradient raised tectonic uplift examples grande colorado river

ways rivers characteristics vary upper lower course summarized bradshaw model powerlaw relationships channel slope depth width given function discharge river regime
biotic classification
several systems classification based biotic conditions typically assigning classes oligotrophic unpolluted eutrophic polluted9 systems based whole ecosystem approach developed zealand ministry environment10 europe requirements water framework directive development wide range classification methods including classifications based fishery status11 system river zonation used francophone communities1213 divides rivers three primary zones

crenon uppermost zone source river divided eucrenon spring boil zone hypocrenon brook headstream zone areas temperatures reduced oxygen content slow moving water
rhithron upstream portion river follows crenon relatively cool temperatures high oxygen levels fast turbulent swift flow
potamon remaining downstream stretch river warmer temperatures lower oxygen levels slow flow sandier bottoms

whitewater classification
international scale river difficulty used rate challenges navigation—particularly rapids class easiest class hardest
stream order classification
strahler stream order ranks rivers based connectivity hierarchy contributing tributaries headwaters first order amazon river twelfth order approximately rivers streams world first second order
certain languages distinctions made among rivers based stream order french example rivers called fleuve rivers called rivière example canada churchill river manitoba called rivière churchill runs hudson churchill river labrador called fleuve churchill runs atlantic ocean rivers france known names without word rivière fleuve seine fleuve seine even though seine classed fleuve prominent rivers francophonie commonly known fleuve fleuve saintlaurent saint lawrence river
since many fleuves large prominent receiving many tributaries word sometimes used refer certain large rivers flow fleuves however even small streams called fleuve fleuve côtier coastal fleuve

direction




river meandering course


rivers flow downhill power derived gravity direction involve directions compass complex meandering path202122
rivers flowing downhill river source river mouth necessarily take shortest path alluvial streams straight braided rivers sinuosity flow directly hill meandering rivers flow side side across valley bedrock rivers typically flow either fractal pattern pattern determined weaknesses bedrock faults fractures erodible layers
rate
main article streamflow
volumetric flow rate also known discharge volume flow rate rate water flow volume water passes given crosssection river channel unit time typically measured cubic metres second cumec cubic feet second 3551 ft3s sometimes also measured litres gallons second
volumetric flow rate thought mean velocity flow given crosssection times crosssectional area mean velocity approximated wall general velocity increases depth hydraulic radius slope river channel crosssectional area scales depth width doublecounting depth shows importance variable determining discharge channel
fluvial erosion
youthful stage
vshaped valleys example river liffey dublin ireland
river subject vertical erosion deepening valley hydraulic action loosens dislodges rock rivers load erodes banks river time deepen river create steeper sides weathered
steepened nature banks causes sides valley move downslope causing valley become vshaped
waterfalls also form youthful river valley example powerscourt waterfall county wicklow ireland
waterfalls usually form band hard rock lies next layer soft rock easier erode differential erosion occurs river erode soft rock easier hard rock leaves hard rock elevated stands river hydraulic action abrasion erodes soft rock water fall river plunge pool forms bottom deepens result hydraulic action abrasion23
sediment yield
sediment yield total quantity particulate matter suspended bedload reaching outlet drainage basin fixed time frame yield usually expressed kilograms square kilometre year sediment delivery processes affected myriad factors drainage area size basin slope climate sediment type lithology vegetation cover human land management practices theoretical concept sediment delivery ratio ratio yield total amount sediment eroded captures fact sediment eroded within certain catchment reaches outlet example deposition floodplains storage opportunities typically increased catchments larger size thus leading lower yield sediment delivery ratio

river bank repair


main article river engineering
rivers often managed controlled make useful less disruptive human activity

dams weirs built control flow store water extract energy
levees known dikes europe built prevent river water flowing floodplains floodways
canals connect rivers another water transfer navigation
river courses modified improve navigation straightened increase flow rate

river management continuous activity rivers tend undo modifications made people dredged channels silt sluice mechanisms deteriorate levees dams suffer seepage catastrophic failure benefits sought managing rivers often offset social economic costs mitigating effects management example parts developed world rivers confined within channels free flat floodplain land development floods inundate development high financial cost often loss life
rivers increasingly managed habitat conservation critical many aquatic riparian plants resident migratory fishes waterfowl birds prey migrating birds many mammals
