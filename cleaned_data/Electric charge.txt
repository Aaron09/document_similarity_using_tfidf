common charge carriers positively charged proton negatively charged electron movement charged particles constitutes electric current many situations suffices speak conventional current without regard whether carried positive charges moving direction conventional current negative charges moving opposite direction macroscopic viewpoint approximation simplifies electromagnetic concepts calculations
opposite extreme looks microscopic situation sees many ways carrying electric current including flow electrons flow electron holes like positive particles negative positive particles ions charged particles flowing opposite directions electrolytic solution plasma
beware common important case metallic wires direction conventional current opposite drift velocity actual charge carriers electrons source confusion beginners
