heir apparent versus heir presumptiveedit




throngs imperial palace japan awaiting appearance crown prince hirohito recent proclamation official recognition heir apparent japanese imperial throne york times 1916


hereditary system governed form primogeniture heir apparent easily identifiable person whose position first line succession title office secure regardless future births heir presumptive contrast always bumped succession birth somebody closely related legal sense according form primogeniture current titleholder
clearest example occurs case holder hereditary title inherited single person children time produce children offspring titleholder rank ahead whatever distant relative titleholders sibling perhaps nephew cousin heir presumptive
many legal systems assume childbirth always possible regardless health circumstances person practical sense heir apparent still legally speaking heir presumptive indeed queen victoria succeeded uncle king william wording proclamation even gave caveat

saving rights issue late majesty king william born late majestys consort

provided possibility williams wife adelaide saxemeiningen pregnant moment death since posthumous child regardless would displaced victoria throne2 adelaide time pregnancy possible even unlikely
daughters malepreference primogenitureedit
daughters lines inherit titles descend according malepreference primogeniture default sons heirs female male offspring right place somewhere order succession comes place female rank behind brothers regardless ages
thus normally even daughter heir apparent since time brother might born though younger would assume position hence heir presumptive example queen elizabeth heir presumptive reign father king george stage death george could fathered legitimate
women heirs apparentedit
system absolute primogeniture disregards gender female heirs apparent occur succession titles positions offices past often favoured males females females considered heir apparent rare absolute primogeniture practiced modern monarchy succession thrones late twentieth century sweden first adopt absolute primogeniture 1980 european monarchies following suit
since adoption absolute primogeniture contemporary european monarchies examples female heir apparents include crown princess victoria sweden princess catharinaamalia netherlands princess elisabeth belgium respectively oldest children kings carl gustaf willemalexander philippe princess ingrid alexandra norway heir apparent father heir apparent norwegian throne victoria female heir apparent oldest child princess estelle victoria heir apparent birth 1977 gained status 1980 following change swedish succession younger brother carl philip born 1979 thus heir apparent months rare example heir apparent losing status without death occurring
2015 pursuant 2011 perth agreement commonwealth realms changed rules succession thrones elizabeth absolute primogeniture except male heirs born perth agreement effects likely felt many years first heirs time agreement charles prince wales prince william duke cambridge already eldest born children 2013 williams firstborn prince george cambridge became next apparent successor
even legal systems apply malepreference primogeniture female heirs apparent means impossible male heir apparent dies leaving sons least daughter eldest daughter would replace father heir apparent whatever throne title concerned become clear widow deceased pregnant representative fathers line would assume place ahead distant relatives situation date occurred english british throne several times heir apparent died example either childless left sons however several female heirs apparent british peerages frances ward baroness dudley henrietta wentworth baroness wentworth
special case however england scotland female heir apparent revolution settlement established william mary joint monarchs 1689 gave power continue succession issue mary eldest daughter previous king james william contrast reign life hypothetical children wife mary would placed original place marys first cousin line succession marys younger sister anne thus although marys death william continued reign power beget direct heirs3 anne became heir apparent remainder williams reign eventually succeeded queen england scotland ireland
displacement heirs apparentedit
position heir apparent normally unshakable assumed inherit sometimes however extraordinary events—such death deposition parent—intervene
people lost heir apparent statusedit
