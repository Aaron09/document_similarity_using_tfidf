understanding basic maps field cartography divided general categories general cartography thematic cartography general cartography involves maps constructed general audience thus contain variety features general maps exhibit many reference location systems often produced series example 124000 scale topographic maps united states geological survey usgs standard compared 150000 scale canadian maps government produces classic 150000 replacing older inch mile ordnance survey maps entire range correlated larger smallerscale maps great detail many private mapping companies also produce thematic series
thematic cartography involves maps specific geographic themes oriented toward specific audiences couple examples might showing corn production indiana shaded area ohio counties divided numerical choropleth classes volume geographic data exploded last century thematic cartography become increasingly useful necessary interpret spatial cultural social data
orienteering combines general thematic cartography designed specific user community prominent thematic element shading indicates degrees difficulty travel vegetation vegetation identified merely classified difficulty fight presents
topographic topologicaledit

purpose selection informationedit
arthur robinson american cartographer influential thematic cartography stated properly designed cartographic failure also claimed considering aspects cartography design perhaps complex27 robinson codified mapmakers understanding must designed foremost consideration audience needs
beginning mapmaking maps made particular purpose purposes28 intent illustrated manner percipient acknowledges purpose timely fashion term percipient refers person receiving information coined robinson29 principle figureground refers notion engaging user presenting clear presentation leaving confusion concerning purpose enhance users experience keep attention user unable identify demonstrated reasonable fashion regarded useless
making meaningful ultimate goal alan maceachren explains well designed convincing implies authenticity 1994 interesting doubt engage reader information richness multivariate shows relationships within showing several variables allows comparison adds meaningfulness also generates hypothesis stimulates ideas perhaps research order convey message creator must design manner reader overall understanding purpose title provide needed link necessary communicating message overall design fosters manner reader interprets monmonier 1993
21st century possible find virtually anything inner workings human body virtual worlds cyberspace therefore huge variety different styles types example area evolved specific recognisable variation used public transport organisations guide passengers namely urban rail metro maps many loosely based degree angles originally perfected harry beck george
naming conventionsedit
main articles toponymy cartographic labeling
maps text label places things title legend information although maps often made specific language place names often differ languages made english name germany country german would deutschland french allemagne nonnative term place referred exonym
cases correct name clear example nation burma officially changed name myanmar many nations recognize ruling junta continue burma sometimes official name change resisted languages older name remain common examples include saigon minh city bangkok krung thep ivory coast côte divoire
difficulties arise transliteration transcription writing systems required wellknown places wellestablished names languages writing systems russia rußland росси́я cases system transliteration transcription required even former case exclusive exonym unhelpful user much english user italy show livorno leghorn road signs railway timetables show livorno transliteration characters script represented characters another example cyrillic letter usually written latin script although many cases simple oneforone equivalence systems exist transliteration arabic results vary example yemeni city mocha written variously english mocha mukha almukhā mocca moka transliteration systems based relating written symbols another transcription attempt spell language phonetic sounds another chinese writing usually converted latin alphabet pinyin phonetic transcription systems systems used past wadegiles resulting city spelled beijing newer english maps peking older ones
difficulties arise countries especially former colonies strong national geographic naming standard cases cartographers choose various phonetic spellings local names versus older imposed sometimes resented colonial names countries multiple official languages resulting multiple official placenames example capital belgium brussel bruxelles canada english french official languages places names languages british columbia also officially named colombiebritannique english maps rarely show french names outside quebec spelled québec french30
study placenames called toponymy origin historical usage placenames words etymology
order improve legibility illiterate maps produced using pictograms represent places iconic example practice lance wymans early plans mexico city metro stations shown simply stylized logos wyman also prototyped washington metro though ultimately idea rejected cities experimenting maps fukuoka guadalajara monterrey31
symbologyedit
cartographic symbology encodes information ways intended convey information reader efficiently taking consideration limited space models human understanding visual means likely cultural background education reader symbology implicit using universal elements design specific cartography even
many kinds symbolization examples

legend explains maps pictorial language
title indicates region perhaps theme portrays
neatline frames entire image
compass rose north arrow provides orientation
overview gives global context primary
scale translates measurements real distances
projection provides represent curved surface plane

declare sources accuracy publication date authorship forth image portrays region
coloring another form symbology whose importance reach beyond aesthetic complex thematic maps example color schemes structure critically affect readers ability understand maps information modern computer displays print technologies reproduce much gamut humans perceive allowing intricate exploitation human visual discrimination order convey detailed information
quantitative symbols give visual indication magnitude phenomenon symbol represents major classes symbols used portray quantity proportional symbols change size according phenomenon’s magnitude making appropriate representing statistics choropleth maps portray data collection areas counties census tracts color using color darkness intensity value color evaluated measure intensity concentration

generalizationedit
main article cartographic generalization
good compromise portraying items interest themes right place need show item using text symbol take space might displace item information cartographer thus constantly making judgements include leave show slightly incorrect place issue assumes importance scale gets smaller shows larger area information shown takes space ground good example late 1980s ordnance surveys first digital maps absolute positions major roads sometimes scale distance hundreds metres away ground truth shown digital maps scales 1250000 1625000 overriding need annotate features
projectionsedit
main article projection
earth spherical flat representation generates distortions shapes areas cannot conserved simultaneously distances never preserved32 mapmaker must choose suitable projection according space mapped purpose
cartographic errorsedit
maps contain deliberate errors distortions either propaganda watermark help copyright owner identify infringement error appears competitors maps latter often come form nonexistent misnamed misspelled trap streets33 names forms paper townsites fictitious entries copyright easter eggs34
another motive deliberate errors cartographic vandalism mapmaker wishing leave mark work mount richard example fictitious peak rocky mountains continental divide appeared boulder county colorado early 1970s believed work draftsman richard ciacci fiction discovered years later
sandy island caledonia example fictitious location stubbornly survives reappearing maps copied older maps deleted editions
