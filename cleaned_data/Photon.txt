thomas youngs doubleslit experiment 1801 showed light wave helping invalidate early particle theories light20964


theories eighteenth century light pictured made particles since particle models cannot easily account refraction diffraction birefringence light wave theories light proposed rené descartes 163737 robert hooke 166538 christiaan huygens 167839 however particle models remained dominant chiefly influence isaac newton40 early nineteenth century thomas young august fresnel clearly demonstrated interference diffraction light 1850 wave models generally accepted41 1865 james clerk maxwells prediction42 light electromagnetic wave—which confirmed experimentally 1888 heinrich hertzs detection radio waves43—seemed final blow particle models light




1900 maxwells theoretical model light oscillating electric magnetic fields seemed complete however several observations could explained wave model electromagnetic radiation leading idea lightenergy packaged quanta described later experiments showed lightquanta also carry momentum thus considered particles photon concept born leading deeper understanding electric magnetic fields


maxwell wave theory however account properties light maxwell theory predicts energy light wave depends intensity frequency nevertheless several independent types experiments show energy imparted light atoms depends lights frequency intensity example chemical reactions provoked light frequency higher certain threshold light frequency lower threshold matter intense initiate reaction similarly electrons ejected metal plate shining light sufficiently high frequency photoelectric effect energy ejected electron related lights frequency intensity44note

energy momentum conserved average interactions matter radiation elementary processes absorption emission allows reconcile discontinuously changing energy atom jump energy states continuous release energy radiation
causality abandoned example spontaneous emissions merely emissions stimulated virtual electromagnetic field

however refined compton experiments showed energy–momentum conserved extraordinarily well elementary processes also jolting electron generation photon compton scattering obey causality within accordingly bohr coworkers gave model honorable funeral possible51 nevertheless failures model inspired werner heisenberg development matrix mechanics56
