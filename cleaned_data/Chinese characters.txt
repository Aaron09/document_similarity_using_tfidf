script first used late millennium words chinese generally monosyllabic character denoted single word10 increasing numbers polysyllabic words entered language western zhou period present estimated 25–30 vocabulary classic texts warring states period polysyllabic though words used less commonly monosyllables accounted 80–90 occurrences texts11 process accelerated centuries phonetic change increased number homophones12 estimated thirds 3000 common words modern standard chinese polysyllables vast majority disyllables13
common process form compounds existing words written characters constituent words words also created adding affixes reduplication borrowing languages14 polysyllabic words generally written character syllable15b cases character denotes morpheme descended chinese word16
many characters multiple readings instances denoting different morphemes sometimes different pronunciations modern standard chinese fifth 2400 common characters multiple pronunciations common characters proportion rises 3017 often readings similar sound related meaning chinese period affixes could added word form word often written character many cases pronunciations diverged subsequent sound change example many additional readings middle chinese departing tone major source tone modern standard chinese scholars believe tone reflex chinese suffix range semantic functions18 example

evolution pictograms


chinese characters represent words language using several strategies characters including commonly used originally pictograms depicted objects denoted ideograms meaning expressed iconically vast majority written using rebus principle character similarly sounding word either simply borrowed commonly extended disambiguating semantic marker form phonosemantic compound character24
traditional sixfold classification liùshū writings first described scholar shen postface dictionary shuowen jiezi ad25 analysis sometimes problematic arguably fails reflect complete nature chinese writing system perpetuated long history pervasive
pictogramsedit

xiàngxíngzì

pictograms make small portion chinese characters characters class derive pictures objects denote time standardized simplified stylized make easier write derivation therefore always obvious examples include moon tree wood hemp
concrete number proportion modern characters pictographic nature however shen placed approximately characters category
simple ideogramsedit

zhǐshìzì

also called simple indicatives small category contains characters direct iconic illustrations examples include shàng originally line
compound ideogramsedit

huìyìzì

also translated logical aggregates associative compounds characters interpreted combining pictographic ideographic characters suggest third meaning commonly cited examples include rest composed pictograms person tree good composed woman child
shen placed approximately characters category however many characters believed phonosemantic compounds whose origin obscured subsequent changes form26 scholars reject applicability category compound characters devised ancient times maintaining nowlost secondary readings responsible apparent absence phonetic indicators27
contrast ideographic compounds common among characters coined japan also characters coined china modern times platinum white metal chemical elements east asian languages belong category
rebusedit

jiǎjièzì

also called borrowings phonetic loan characters rebus category covers cases existing character used represent unrelated word similar identical pronunciation sometimes meaning lost completely characters lost original meaning nose completely exclusively means oneself originally meant scorpion used sense thousand
rebus pivotal history writing china insofar represented stage logographic writing could become purely phonetic phonographic chinese characters used purely sound values attested chun zhan manuscripts used write vice versa lines apart happened shao zhao characters question homophonous nearly homophonous time28
phonosemantic compoundsedit

semanticphonetic compounds pictophonetic compounds numerous characters characters composed parts limited characters semantic indicator often graphically simplified suggests general meaning compound character another character phonetic indicator whose pronunciation suggests pronunciation compound character cases semantic indicator also radical character listed dictionaries
examples river lake stream chōng surge slippery characters left radical three short strokes reduced form character shuǐ meaning water indicating character semantic connection water righthand side case phonetic indicator example case chōng chinese ɡljuŋ29 surge phonetic indicator zhōng chinese kljuŋ30 means middle case seen pronunciation character slightly different phonetic indicator effect historical sound change means composition characters sometimes seem arbitrary today
shen placed approximately characters category kangxi dictionary 1716 number closer extremely productive technique extend chinese vocabularycitation needed characters vietnam created using principle
method used form characters example plutonium metal radical plus phonetic component described chinese gives sound gives meaning many chinese names elements periodic table many chemistryrelated characters formed fact possible tell chinese periodic table glance elements metal solid nonmetal stone liquid
occasionally bisyllabic word written characters contain radical húdié butterfly characters insect radical notable example pipa chinese lute also fruit loquat similar shape originally written hand radical referring strokes playing instrument changed tree radical still used fruit character changed referring instrument31 cases compound word coincidentally share radical without meaningful
