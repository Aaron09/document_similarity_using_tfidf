functionedit
many microscopic aquatic animals larger inactive ones absorb sufficient oxygen entire surface bodies respire adequately without gills however complex active aquatic organisms usually require gill gills many invertebrates even amphibians body surface gills gaseous exchange3
gills usually consist thin filaments tissue lamellaee plates branches slender tufted processes highly folded surface increase surface area delicate nature gills possible surrounding water provides support blood body fluid must intimate contact respiratory surface ease diffusion3
high surface area crucial exchange aquatic organisms water contains small fraction dissolved oxygen cubic meter contains grams oxygen concentration oxygen water lower diffuses slowly fresh water dissolved oxygen content approximately cm3l compared cm3l4 water times dense times viscous4 oxygen diffusion rate 10000 times greater water4 saclike lungs remove oxygen water would efficient enough sustain life4 rather using lungs gaseous exchange takes place across surface highly vascularised gills oneway current water kept flowing specialised pumping mechanism density water prevents gills collapsing lying happens fish taken water4
usually water moved across gills direction current motion animal water beating cilia appendages means pumping mechanism fish molluscs efficiency gills greatly enhanced countercurrent exchange mechanism water passes gills opposite direction flow blood mechanism efficient much dissolved oxygen water recovered3

gills vertebrates typically develop walls pharynx along series gill slits opening exterior species employ countercurrent exchange system enhance diffusion substances gill blood water flowing opposite directions gills composed comblike filaments gill lamellae help increase surface area oxygen exchange5
fish breathes draws mouthful water regular intervals draws sides throat together forcing water gill openings passes gills outside fish gill slits evolutionary ancestors tonsils thymus glands eustachian tubes well many structures derived embryonic branchial pouchescitation needed

gills fish form number slits connecting pharynx outside animal either side fish behind head originally many slits evolution number reduced modern fish mostly five pairs never eight6
cartilaginous fishedit
sharks rays typically five pairs gill slits open directly outside body though primitive sharks pairs broadnose sevengill shark cartilaginous fish exceeding number adjacent slits separated cartilaginous gill arch projects cartilaginous gill gill support sheetlike interbranchial septum individual lamellae gills either side base arch also support gill rakers projections pharyngeal cavity help prevent large pieces debris damaging delicate gills7
smaller opening spiracle lies back first gill slit bears small pseudobranch resembles gill structure receives blood already oxygenated true gills7 spiracle thought homologous opening higher vertebrates8
sharks rely ventilation forcing water mouth gills rapidly swimming forward slowmoving bottomdwelling species especially among skates rays spiracle enlarged fish breathes sucking water opening instead mouth7
chimaeras differ cartilagenous fish lost spiracle fifth gill slit remaining slits covered operculum developed septum gill arch front first gill7
bony fishedit

bony fish gills branchial chamber covered bony operculum great majority bony fish species five pairs gills although lost course evolution operculum important adjusting pressure water inside pharynx allow proper ventilation gills bony fish rely ventilation hence near constant motion breathe valves inside mouth keep water escaping7
gill arches bony fish typically septum gills alone project arch supported individual gill rays species retain gill rakers though primitive bony fish lack spiracles pseudobranch associated often remains located base operculum however often greatly reduced consisting small mass cells without remaining gilllike structure7
marine teleosts also gills excrete electrolytes gills large surface area tends create problem fish seek regulate osmolarity internal fluids salt water less dilute internal fluids saltwater fish lose large quantities water osmotically gills regain water drink large amounts water excrete salt fresh water dilute internal fluids fish however freshwater fish gain water osmotically gills7

tadpoles amphibians three five gill slits contain actual gills usually spiracle true operculum present though many species operculumlike structures instead internal gills develop three feathery external gills grow outer surface gill arches sometimes adults retain usually disappear metamorphosis salamanders mudpuppy retain external gills upon reaching adulthood
still extinct tetrapod groups retain true gills study archegosaurus demonstrates internal gills like true fish9

aquatic arthropods usually gills cases modified appendages crustaceans exposed directly water others protected inside gill chamber11 horseshoe crabs book gills external flaps many thin leaflike membranes12
many marine invertebrates bivalve molluscs filter feeders current water maintained gills exchange food particles filtered time trapped mucus moved mouth beating cilia13

plastronsedit
plastron type structural adaptation occurring among aquatic arthropods primarily insects form inorganic gill holds thin film atmospheric oxygen area small openings called spiracles connect tracheal system plastron typically consists dense patches hydrophobic setae body prevent water entry spiracles also involve scales microscopic ridges projecting cuticle physical properties interface trapped film surrounding water allow exchange spiracles almost insect atmospheric carbon dioxide diffuses surrounding water high solubility oxygen diffuses film concentration within film reduced respiration nitrogen also diffuses tension increased oxygen diffuses film higher rate nitrogen diffuses however water surrounding insect become oxygendepleted water movement many insects still water actively direct flow water bodies
inorganic gill mechanism allows aquatic insects plastrons remain constantly submerged examples include many beetles family elmidae aquatic weevils true bugs family aphelocheiridae well least species ricinuleid arachnid14 somewhat similar mechanism used diving bell spider maintains underwater bubble exchanges like plastron diving insects backswimmers hydrophilid beetles carry trapped bubbles deplete oxygen quickly thus need constant replenishment
