many frogs webbed feet degree webbing directly proportional amount time species spends water42 completely aquatic african dwarf frog hymenochirus fully webbed toes whereas whites tree frog litoria caerulea arboreal species quarter half webbed43
arboreal frogs pads located ends toes help grip vertical surfaces suction pads surface consisting instead columnar cells flat tops small gaps lubricated mucous glands frog applies pressure cells adhere irregularities surface grip maintained surface tension allows frog climb smooth surfaces system function efficiently pads excessively wet44
