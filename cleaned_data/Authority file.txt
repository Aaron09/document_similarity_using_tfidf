authority records filesedit
customary enforcing authority control bibliographic catalog separate index authority records relates governs headings used main catalog separate index often referred authority file contains indexable record decisions made cataloguers given library or—as increasingly case—cataloguing consortium cataloguers consult making revising decisions headings result records contain documentation sources used establish particular preferred heading contain information discovered researching heading useful17
authority files provide information particular subject primary function provide information organize it17 contain enough information establish given author title unique irrelevant interesting information generally excluded although practices vary internationally authority records englishspeaking world generally contain following information

headings show preferred title chosen official authorized version important heading unique conflict identical heading chosen


since headings function access points making sure distinct conflict existing entries important example english novelist william collins 1824–89 whose works include moonstone woman white better known wilkie collins cataloguers decide name public would likely look whether also reference link alternative forms individuals name
