worldwide climate classifications



several ways classify climates similar regimes originally climes defined ancient greece describe weather depending upon locations latitude modern climate classification methods broadly divided genetic methods focus causes climate empiric methods focus effects climate examples genetic classification include methods based relative frequency different mass types locations within synoptic weather disturbances examples empiric classifications include climate zones defined plant hardiness16 evapotranspiration17 generally köppen climate classification originally designed identify climates associated certain biomes common shortcoming classification schemes produce distinct boundaries zones define rather gradual transition climate properties common nature
bergeron spatial synopticedit
main article mass
simplest classification involving masses bergeron classification widely accepted form mass classification18 mass classification involves three letters first letter describes moisture properties used continental masses maritime masses moist second letter describes thermal characteristic source region tropical polar arctic antarctic monsoon equatorial superior formed significant downward motion atmosphere third letter used designate stability atmosphere mass colder ground labeled mass warmer ground labeled mass identification originally used weather forecasting 1950s climatologists began establish synoptic climatologies based idea 197320
based upon bergeron classification scheme spatial synoptic classification system categories within scheme polar similar continental polar moderate similar maritime superior tropical similar continental tropical moist polar similar maritime polar moist moderate hybrid maritime polar maritime tropical moist tropical similar maritime tropical maritime monsoon maritime equatorial21
