benjamin franklins gulf stream


european discovery gulf stream dates 1512 expedition juan ponce león became widely used spanish ships sailing caribbean spain1 summary ponce leóns voyage april 1513 noted current although great wind could proceed forward backward seems proceeding well known current powerful wind2 existence also known peter martyr danghiera
benjamin franklin became interested north atlantic ocean circulation patterns 1768 england franklin heard curious complaint colonial board customs take british packets several weeks longer reach york england took average american merchant ship reach newport rhode island despite merchant ships leaving london sail river thames length english channel sailed across atlantic packets left falmouth cornwall3
franklin asked timothy folger cousin twice removed nantucket historical society nantucket island whaling captain answer folger explained merchant ships routinely crossed thenunnamed gulf stream—identifying whale behavior measurement waters temperature speed bubbles surface changes waters color—while mail packet captains franklin worked folger experienced ship captains learning enough chart gulf stream giving name still known today offered information anthony todd secretary british post office ignored british captains3
franklins gulf stream chart published 1770 england mostly ignored4 subsequent versions printed france 1778 17865
