example frequency reuse factor pattern


cellular network mobile network radio network distributed land areas called cells served least fixedlocation transceiver known cell site base station cellular network cell characteristically uses different radio frequencies immediate neighbouring cells avoid interference
joined together cells provide radio coverage wide geographic area enables large number portable transceivers mobile phones pagers communicate fixed transceivers telephones anywhere network base stations even transceivers moving cell transmission
although originally intended cell phones development smartphones cellular telephone networks routinely carry data addition telephone conversations

global system mobile communications network divided three major systems switching system base station system operation support system cell phone connects base system station connects operation support station connects switching station call transferred needs common standard used majority cell phones9
personal communications service radio band used mobile phones north america south asia sprint happened first service

space also created homes result eliminating clutters wiring13 technology allows alternative installing physical network mediums coaxes fiberoptics also expensive
homeedit
homeowners wireless technology effective option compared ethernet sharing printers scanners highspeed internet connections wlans help save cost installation cable mediums save time physical installation also creates mobility devices connected network13 wireless networks simple require single wireless access point connected directly internet router11
wireless network elementsedit
telecommunications network physical layer also consists many interconnected wireline network elements standalone systems products either supplied single manufacturer assembled service provider user system integrator parts several different manufacturers
wireless products devices used wireless carrier provide support backhaul network well mobile switching center
reliable wireless service depends network elements physical layer protected operational environments applications gr3171 generic requirements network elements used wireless networks physical layer criteria14
especially important located cell tower base station cabinet attachment hardware positioning antenna associated closures cables required adequate strength robustness corrosion resistance resistance wind storms icing weather conditions requirements individual components hardware cables connectors closures shall take consideration structure attached
difficultiesedit
interferencesedit
compared wired systems wireless networks frequently subject electromagnetic interference caused networks types equipment generate radio waves within close radio bands used communication interference degrade signal cause system fail4
absorption reflectionedit
materials cause absorption electromagnetic waves preventing reaching receiver cases particularly metallic conductive materials reflection occurs cause dead zones reception available aluminium foiled thermal isolation modern homes easily reduce indoor mobile signals frequently leading complaints reception longdistance rural cell signals
multipath fadingedit
multipath fading different routes taken signal reflections cause signal cancel certain locations stronger places upfade
hidden node problemedit
hidden node problem occurs types network node visible wireless access point nodes communicating leads difficulties media access control
shared resource problemedit
wireless spectrum limited resource shared nodes range transmitters bandwidth allocation becomes complex multiple participating users often users aware advertised numbers ieee 80211 equipment networks capacity shared users thus individual user rate lower increasing demand capacity crunch likely happen userintheloop alternative solution ever upgrading newer technologies overprovisioning
