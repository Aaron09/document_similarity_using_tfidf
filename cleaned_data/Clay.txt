formationedit




deforestation clay extraction janeiro brazil picture morro covanca jacarepaguá


clay minerals typically form long periods time result gradual chemical weathering rocks usually silicatebearing concentrations carbonic acid diluted solvents solvents usually acidic migrate weathering rock leaching upper weathered layers addition weathering process clay minerals formed hydrothermal activity types clay deposits primary secondary primary clays form residual deposits soil remain site formation secondary clays clays transported original location water erosion deposited sedimentary deposit4 clay deposits typically associated energy depositional environments large lakes marine basins
groupingedit
depending academic source three four main groups clays kaolinite montmorillonitesmectite illite chlorite chlorites always considered clay sometimes classified separate group within phyllosilicates approximately different types pure clays categories natural clay deposits mixtures different types along weathered minerals
varve varved clay clay visible annual layers formed seasonal deposition layers marked differences erosion organic content type deposit common former glacial lakes fine sediments delivered calm waters glacial lake basins away shoreline settle lake resulting seasonal layering preserved even distribution clay sediment banding4
quick clay unique type marine clay indigenous glaciated terrains norway canada northern ireland sweden highly sensitive clay prone liquefaction involved several deadly landslides
historical modern usesedit




clay layers construction site clay normally much stable sand regard excavations


clays exhibit plasticity mixed water certain proportions however clay becomes firm fired kiln permanent physical chemical changes occur changes convert clay ceramic material properties clay used making pottery utilitarian decorative construction products bricks wall floor tiles different types clay used different minerals firing conditions used produce earthenware stoneware porcelain prehistoric humans discovered useful properties clay earliest pottery shards recovered central honshu japan associated jomon culture deposits recovered dated around 14000




bottle stopper made clay 14th century


clay tablets first known writing medium6 scribes wrote inscribing cuneiform script using blunt reed called stylus purposemade clay balls also used sling ammunition
clays sintered fire first form ceramic bricks cooking pots objects dishware even musical instruments ocarina shaped clay fired clay also used many industrial processes paper making cement production chemical filtering clay also often used manufacture pipes smoking tobacco late 20th century bentonite clay widely used mold binder manufacture sand castings
clay relatively impermeable water also used natural seals needed cores dams barrier landfills toxic seepage lining landfill preferably combination geotextiles7 puddling
studies early 21st century investigated clays absorption capacities various applications removal heavy metals waste water purification89
medicinal usesedit
traditional uses clay medicine back prehistoric times example armenian bole used soothe upset stomach similar parrots later humans south america originally used clay10 kaolin clay attapulgite used antidiarrheal medicines
building materialedit
clay oldest building materials earth among ancient naturallyoccurring geologic materials stone organic materials like wood11 onehalf twothirds worlds population traditional societies well developed countries still live work buildings made clay often baked brick essential part loadbearing structure also primary ingredient many natural building techniques clay used create adobe cordwood rammed earth structures building elements wattle daub clay plaster clay render case clay floors clay paints ceramic building material clay used mortar brick chimneys stone walls protected water
