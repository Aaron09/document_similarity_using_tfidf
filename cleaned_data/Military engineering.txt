originsedit
word engineer initially used context warfare dating back 1325 engine’er literally operates engine referred constructor military engines4 context engine referred military machine mechanical contraption used example catapult
design civilian structures bridges buildings developed technical discipline term civil engineering5 entered lexicon distinguish specializing construction nonmilitary projects involved older discipline prevalence civil engineering outstripped engineering military context number disciplines expanded original military meaning word “engineering” largely obsolete place term military engineering come used
tasks military engineeringedit
modern military engineering divided three main tasks fields combat engineering strategic support ancillary support combat engineering associated engineering battlefield combat engineers responsible increasing mobility front lines digging trenches building temporary facilities zones strategic support associated providing service communication zones construction airfields improvement upgrade ports roads railways communication ancillary support includes provision distribution maps well disposal unexploded warheads military engineers construct bases airfields roads bridges ports hospitals peacetime modern warfare military engineers took role civil engineers participating construction civilworks projects nowadays military engineers almost entirely engaged logistics preparedness1
