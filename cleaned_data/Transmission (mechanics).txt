uses transmission disambiguation
gearbox redirects video game developer gearbox software transmission component gear train
transmission machine power transmission system provides controlled application power often term transmission refers simply gearbox uses gears gear trains provide speed torque conversions rotating power source another device12
british english term transmission refers whole drivetrain including clutch gearbox prop shaft rearwheel drive differential final drive shafts american english however term refers specifically gearbox alone detailed usage differsnote
common motor vehicles transmission adapts output internal combustion engine drive wheels engines need operate relatively high rotational speed inappropriate starting stopping slower travel transmission reduces higher engine speed slower wheel speed increasing torque process transmissions also used pedal bicycles fixed machines different rotational speeds torques adapted
often transmission multiple gear ratios simply gears ability switch speed varies switching done manually operator automatically directional forward reverse control also provided singleratio transmissions also exist simply change speed torque sometimes direction motor output
motor vehicles transmission generally connected engine crankshaft flywheel clutch fluid coupling partly internal combustion engines cannot particular speed output transmission transmitted driveshaft differentials drives wheels differential also provide gear reduction primary purpose permit wheels either axle rotate different speeds essential avoid wheel slippage turns changes direction rotation
conventional gearbelt transmissions mechanism speedtorque adaptation alternative mechanisms include torque converters power transformation dieselelectric transmission hydraulic drive system hybrid configurations also exist automatic transmissions valve body shift gears using fluid pressures conjunction
