kilowatt hour symbolized kw⋅h composite unit energy equivalent kilowatt power sustained hour watt equal kilowatt hour megajoules12 amount energy converted work done average rate thousand watts hour
base unit energy within international system units joule hour unit time outside making kilowatt hour nonsi unit energy kilowatt hour listed among nonsi units accepted bipm although hour kilowatt hour derived
examplesedit
electric heater rated 1000 watts kilowatt operating hour uses kilowatt hour equivalent megajoules energy television rated watts operating hours continuously uses kilowatt hour 40watt electric appliance operating continuously hours uses kilowatt hour terms human power healthy adult male manual laborer perform work equal half kilowatt hour eight hour
electrical energy often sold kilowatt hours cost running electric device calculated multiplying devices power kilowatts running time hours price kilowatt hour unit price electricity depend upon rate consumption time industrial users also extra charges according peak usage power factor
whereas individual homes kilowatt hours consumed commercial buildings institutions also peak power consumption greatest power recorded fairly short time minutes compensates power company maintaining infrastructure needed provide peak power charges billed demand charges4
major energy production consumption often expressed terawatt hours tw⋅h given period often calendar year financial year 365day year equals 8760 hours therefore gigawatt equals terawatt hours year conversely terawatt hour equal sustained power approximately megawatts period year

confusion kilowatt hours energy kilowatts poweredit
terms power energy frequently confused power rate delivery energy power work performed unit time energy work performed period time
power measured using unit watts joules second energy measured using unit watt hours joules
common household battery contains energy battery delivers energy certain power level rate delivery energy higher power level quicker batterys stored energy delivered power higher batterys stored energy depleted shorter time period
given period time higher level power causes energy used given power level longer period causes energy used given amount energy higher level power causes energy used less time
misuse watts houredit
power units measure rate energy unit time many compound units rates explicitly mention units time example miles hour kilometers hour dollars hour kilowatt hours product power time rate change power time watts hour unit change power hour might used characterize rampup behavior power plants example power plant reaches power output minutes rampup rate hydroelectric power plants high rampup rate makes particularly useful peak load emergency situations
proper terms watts hour uncommon whereas misuse13 widespread
energyrelated unitsedit
several units commonly used indicate power energy capacity specific application areas
average annual power production consumption expressed kilowatt hours year example comparing energy efficiency household appliances whose power consumption varies time season year energy produced distributed power source kilowatt hour year equals 11408 milliwatts applied constantly year
energy content battery usually expressed indirectly capacity amperehours convert amperehour watt hours amperehour value must multiplied voltage power source value approximate since battery voltage constant discharge higher discharge rates reduce total amount energy battery provide case devices output different voltage battery battery voltage typically liion must used calculate rather device output example usually portable chargers results device running hours 2500 battery five hours
