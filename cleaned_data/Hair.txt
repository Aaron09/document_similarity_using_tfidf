overviewedit
word hair usually refers distinct structures

part beneath skin called hair follicle pulled skin bulb organ located dermis maintains stem cells regrow hair falls also recruited regrow skin wound2
shaft hard filamentous part extends skin surface cross section hair shaft divided roughly three zones

hair fibers structure consisting several layers starting outside

cuticle consists several layers flat thin cells laid overlapping another roof shingles
cortex contains keratin bundles cell structures remain roughly rodlike
medulla disorganized open area fibers center3

andre walker system

hair typing system widely used system classify hair system created hairstylist oprah winfrey andre walker according system four types hair straight wavy curly kinky

type straight hair reflects sheen also resilient hair hair types hard damage immensely difficult curl hair texture sebum easily spreads scalp ends without curls kinks interrupt path oily hair texture
type wavy hair whose texture sheen ranges somewhere straight curly hair wavy hair also likely become frizzy straight hair type waves easily alternate straight curly styles type wavy hair resistant styling
type curly hair known sshape curl pattern resemble lowercase uppercase sometimes uppercase lowercase zcitation needed hair type usually voluminous climate dependent humidity frizz damage prone lack proper care causes less defined curls
type kinky hair features tightly coiled curl pattern discernible curl pattern often fragile high density type hair shrinks fewer cuticle layers hair types susceptible damage
