historyedit
fisheries explicitly managed places hundreds years percent worlds commercial exploitation fish shellfish harvest natural occurring populations oceans freshwater areas3 example māori people zealand residents years prohibitions taking could eaten giving back first fish caught offering tangaroa4 starting 18th century attempts made regulate fishing north norwegian fishery resulted enactment 1816 lofoten fishery established measure come known territorial rights5

fishing banks divided areas belonging nearest fishing base land subdivided fields boats allowed fish allocation fishing fields hands local governing committees usually headed owner onshore facilities fishermen rent accommodation drying fish6

governmental resource protectionbased fisheries management relatively idea first developed north european fisheries first overfishing conference held london 1936 1957 british fisheries researchers beverton sidney holt published seminal work north commercial fisheries dynamics7 1960s work became theoretical platform north european management schemes
years away field fisheries management beverton criticized earlier work paper given first world fisheries congress athens 1992 dynamics exploited fish populations expressed concerns including sidney holts work misinterpreted misused fishery biologists managers previous years8 nevertheless institutional foundation modern fishery management laid
1996 marine stewardship council founded standards sustainable fishing 2010 aquaculture stewardship council created aquaculture
report prince charles international sustainability unit yorkbased environmental defense fund 50in10 published july 2014 estimated global fisheries adding billion year global full implementation sustainable fishing figure could rise extra amount much billion9
political objectivesedit
according fisheries management based explicitly political objectives ideally transparent priorities10 typical political objectives exploiting fish resource to11

maximize sustainable biomass yield
maximize sustainable economic yield
secure increase employment
secure protein production food supplies
increase export income

political goals also weak part fisheries management since objectives conflict other11
international objectivesedit
fisheries objectives need expressed concrete management rules countries fisheries management rules based internationally agreed though nonbinding code conduct responsible fisheries12 agreed meeting food agriculture organization session 1995 precautionary approach prescribes typically implemented concrete management rules minimum spawning biomass maximum fishing mortality rates 2005 fisheries centre university british columbia comprehensively reviewed performance worlds major fishing nations code13
international agreements required order regulate fisheries international waters desire agreement maritime issues three conferences ultimately treaty known united nations convention unclos concepts exclusive economic zones extending nautical miles nations coasts allocate certain sovereign rights responsibilities resource management individual countries
situations need additional intergovernmental coordination example mediterranean relatively narrow bodies water nautical miles irrelevant international waters beyond 12nauticalmile shore require explicit agreements
straddling fish stocks migrate also present challenges sovereign responsibility must agreed neighbouring coastal states fishing entities usually done medium regional organisation purpose coordinating management stock
unclos prescribe precisely fisheries confined international waters managed several fisheries high seas bottom trawling fisheries subject international agreement across entire range november 2004 general assembly issued resolution fisheries prepared development international fisheries management
management mechanismsedit
many countries ministriesgovernment departments named ministry fisheries similar controlling aspects fisheries within exclusive economic zones four categories management means devised regulating either inputinvestment output operating either directly indirectly



inputs
outputs


indirect
vessel licensing
catching techniques


direct
limited entry
catch quota technical regulation


technical means include

prohibiting devices bows arrows spears firearms
prohibiting nets
setting minimum mesh sizes
limiting average potential catch vessel fleet vessel crew size gear electronic gear physical inputs14
prohibiting bait
snagging
limits fish traps
limiting number poles lines fisherman
restricting number simultaneous fishing vessels
limiting vessels average operational intensity unit time
limiting average time

catch quotasedit
main article individual transferable quota
systems individual transferable quotas also called individual fishing quota limit total catch allocate shares quota among fishers work fishery fishers buyselltrade shares choose
large scale study 2008 provided strong evidence itqs help prevent fishery collapse even restore fisheries appear decline15161718 studies shown negative socioeconomic consequences itqs especially smallsclale fisheries19 consequences include concentration quota hands fishers increased number inactive fishers leasing quotas others phenomenon known armchair fishermen detrimental effects coastal communities20
precautionary principleedit
fishery managers guidebook issued 2009 united nations advises precautionary approach principle applied ecosystem resilience human impact including reversibility difficult forecast hard distinguish natural changes1013021 precautionary principle suggests action risks harm proceeded scientifically proven safe historically fishery managers applied principle round fishing activities curtailed proven already damaged existing ecosystems22 paper published 2007 shertzer prager suggested significant benefits stock biomass fishery yield management stricter prompt23 supported recent work management north fisheries accordance ranges acceptable fishing fishing acceptable ranges many times risky fishing near bottom delivers yield
fisheries lawedit
main article fisheries
fisheries emerging specialized area includes study analysis different fisheries management approaches including seafood safety regulations aquaculture regulations despite importance area rarely taught schools around world leaves vacuum advocacy research
climate changeedit
main article fisheries climate change
past changing climate affected inland offshore fisheries changes likely continue25 fisheries perspective specific driving factors climate change include rising water temperature alterations hydrologic cycle changes nutrient fluxes relocation spawning nursery habitat changes factors would affect resources levels biological organization including genetic organism population ecosystem levels26
population dynamicsedit
main article population dynamics fisheries
population dynamics describes growth decline given fishery stock time controlled birth death migration basis understanding changing fishery patterns issues habitat destruction predation optimal harvesting rates population dynamics fisheries traditionally used fisheries scientists determine sustainable yields2728
basic accounting relation population dynamics bide model29

also ecosystembased management
according marine ecologist chris frid fishing industry points pollution global warming causes unprecedentedly fish stocks recent years writing everybody would like rebuilding fish stocks achieved understand influences human natural fish dynamics overfishing also effect frid adds “fish communities altered number ways example decrease particular sized individuals species targeted affects predator prey dynamics fishing however sole perpetrator changes marine life pollution another example factor operates isolation components ecosystem respond differently individual factor33
contrast traditional approach focusing single species ecosystembased approach organized terms ecosystem services ecosystembased fishery concepts implemented regions34 2007 group scientists offered following commandments35





keep perspective holistic riskadverse adaptive
maintain “old growth” structure fish populations since female fish shown best spawners also susceptible overfishing
characterize maintain natural spatial structure fish stocks management boundaries match natural boundaries
monitor maintain seafloor habitats make sure fish food shelter
maintain resilient ecosystems able withstand occasional shocks
identify maintain critical foodweb connections including predators forage species
adapt ecosystem changes time shortterm longer cycles decades centuries including global climate change
account evolutionary changes caused fishing tends remove large older fish
include actions humans social economic systems ecological equations

elderly maternal fishedit




female rockfish best producers


traditional management practices reduce number slowgrowing fish leaving room resources younger fastergrowing fish marine fish produce huge numbers eggs assumption younger spawners would produce plenty viable larvae36
however 2005 research rockfish shows large elderly females important younger fish maintaining productive fisheries larvae produced older maternal fish grow faster survive starvation better much likely survive offspring younger fish failure account role older fish help explain recent collapses major west coast fisheries recovery stocks expected take decades prevent collapses establish marine reserves fishing allowed fish populations naturally36

data qualityedit
according fisheries scientist milo adkison primary limitation fisheries management decisions absence quality data fisheries management decisions often based population models models need quality data effective asserts scientists fishery managers would better served simpler models improved data37
