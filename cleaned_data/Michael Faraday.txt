michael faraday ˈfærəˌdeɪ september 1791 august 1867 english scientist contributed study electromagnetism electrochemistry main discoveries include principles underlying electromagnetic induction diamagnetism electrolysis
although faraday received little formal education influential scientists history research magnetic field around conductor carrying direct current faraday established basis concept electromagnetic field physics faraday also established magnetism could affect rays light underlying relationship phenomena12 similarly discovered principles electromagnetic induction diamagnetism laws electrolysis inventions electromagnetic rotary devices formed foundation electric motor technology largely efforts electricity became practical technology
chemist faraday discovered benzene investigated clathrate hydrate chlorine invented early form bunsen burner system oxidation numbers popularised terminology anode cathode electrode faraday ultimately became first foremost fullerian professor chemistry royal institution lifetime position
faraday excellent experimentalist conveyed ideas clear simple language mathematical abilities however extend trigonometry limited simplest algebra james clerk maxwell took work faraday others summarized equations accepted basis modern theories electromagnetic phenomena faradays uses lines force maxwell wrote show faraday reality mathematician high order mathematicians future derive valuable fertile methods3 unit capacitance named honour farad
albert einstein kept picture faraday study wall alongside pictures isaac newton james clerk maxwell4 physicist ernest rutherford stated consider magnitude extent discoveries influence progress science industry honour great memory faraday greatest scientific discoverers time5

faradays earliest chemical work assistant humphry davy faraday specifically involved study chlorine discovered compounds chlorine carbon also conducted first rough experiments diffusion gases phenomenon first pointed john dalton physical importance phenomenon fully revealed thomas graham joseph loschmidt faraday succeeded liquefying several gases investigated alloys steel produced several kinds glass intended optical purposes specimen heavy glasses subsequently became historically important glass placed magnetic field faraday determined rotation plane polarisation light specimen also first substance found repelled poles magnet
faraday invented early form become bunsen burner practical science laboratories around world convenient source heat3031 faraday worked extensively field chemistry discovering chemical substances benzene called bicarburet hydrogen liquefying gases chlorine liquefying gases helped establish gases vapours liquids possessing boiling point gave solid basis concept molecular aggregation 1820 faraday reported first synthesis compounds made carbon chlorine c2cl6 c2cl4 published results following year323334 faraday also determined composition chlorine clathrate hydrate discovered humphry davy 18103536 faraday also responsible discovering laws electrolysis popularizing terminology anode cathode electrode terms proposed large part william whewell37
faraday first report later came called metallic nanoparticles 1847 discovered optical properties gold colloids differed corresponding bulk metal probably first reported observation effects quantum size might considered birth nanoscience38
electricity magnetism
faraday best known work regarding electricity magnetism first recorded experiment construction voltaic pile seven hapenny coins stacked together seven disks sheet zinc pieces paper moistened salt water pile decomposed sulfate magnesia first letter abbott july 1812




electromagnetic rotation experiment faraday 182139


1821 soon danish physicist chemist hans christian ørsted discovered phenomenon electromagnetism davy british scientist william hyde wollaston tried failed design electric motor2 faraday discussed problem went build devices produce called electromagnetic rotation known homopolar motor caused continuous circular motion engendered circular magnetic force around wire extended pool mercury wherein placed magnet wire would rotate around magnet supplied current chemical battery experiments inventions formed foundation modern electromagnetic technology excitement faraday published results without acknowledging work either wollaston davy resulting controversy within royal society strained mentor relationship davy well contributed faradays assignment activities consequently prevented involvement electromagnetic research several years4041

faraday holding type glass used 1845 show magnetism affects light dielectric material52


1845 faraday discovered many materials exhibit weak repulsion magnetic field phenomenon termed diamagnetism53
faraday also discovered plane polarization linearly polarized light rotated application external magnetic field aligned direction light moving termed faraday effect50 sept 1845 wrote notebook last succeeded illuminating magnetic curve line force magnetising light54
later life 1862 faraday used spectroscope search different alteration light change spectral lines applied magnetic field equipment available however insufficient definite determination spectral change pieter zeeman later used improved apparatus study phenomenon publishing results 1897 receiving 1902 nobel prize physics success 1897 paper55 nobel acceptance speech56 zeeman made reference faradays work
