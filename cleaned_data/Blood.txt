vertebrates composed blood cells suspended blood plasma plasma constitutes blood fluid mostly water volume2 contains dissipated proteins glucose mineral ions hormones carbon dioxide plasma main medium excretory product transportation blood cells albumin main protein plasma functions regulate colloidal osmotic pressure blood blood cells mainly blood cells also called rbcs erythrocytes white blood cells also called wbcs leukocytes platelets also called thrombocytes abundant cells vertebrate blood blood cells contain hemoglobin ironcontaining protein facilitates oxygen transport reversibly binding respiratory greatly increasing solubility blood contrast carbon dioxide mostly transported extracellularly bicarbonate transported plasma
vertebrate blood bright hemoglobin oxygenated dark deoxygenated animals crustaceans mollusks hemocyanin carry oxygen instead hemoglobin insects mollusks fluid called hemolymph instead blood difference hemolymph contained closed circulatory system insects blood contain oxygencarrying molecules hemoglobin bodies small enough tracheal system suffice supplying oxygen

blood circulated around body blood vessels pumping action heart humans blood pumped strong left ventricle heart arteries peripheral tissues returns right atrium heart veins enters right ventricle pumped pulmonary artery lungs returns left atrium pulmonary veins blood enters left ventricle circulated arterial blood carries oxygen inhaled cells body venous blood carries carbon dioxide waste product metabolism cells lungs exhaled however exception includes pulmonary arteries contain deoxygenated blood body pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood
additional return flow generated movement skeletal muscles compress veins push blood valves veins toward right atrium
blood circulation famously described william harvey 162812

carbon dioxide transport
carried blood three different ways exact percentages vary depending whether arterial venous blood converted bicarbonate ions hco−
enzyme carbonic anhydrase blood cells reaction h2co3 hco−
dissolved plasma bound hemoglobin carbamino compounds2324 hemoglobin main oxygencarrying molecule blood cells carries oxygen carbon dioxide however bound hemoglobin bind site oxygen instead combines nterminal groups four globin chains however allosteric effects hemoglobin molecule binding decreases amount oxygen bound given partial pressure oxygen decreased binding carbon dioxide blood increased oxygen levels known haldane effect important transport carbon dioxide tissues lungs rise partial pressure lower cause offloading oxygen hemoglobin known bohr effect

rate blood flow
rate blood flow varies greatly different tissues liver abundant blood supply approximate blood flow 1350mlmin kidney brain second third supplied tissues 1100 mlmin 700mlmin respectively25
rate blood flow 100g tissue criterion gradings completely different kidney adrenal gland thyroid first second third supplied tissues respectively25
