pathogenicityedit
pathogenicity potential diseasecausing capacity pathogens pathogenicity related virulence meaning authorities come distinguish qualitative term whereas latter quantitative standard organism said pathogenic nonpathogenic particular context pathogenic another comparisons described instead terms relative virulence pathogenicity also distinct transmissibility virus quantifies risk infection5
pathogen described terms ability produce toxins enter tissue colonize hijack nutrients ability immunosuppress host
contextdependent pathogenicityedit
common speak entire species bacteria pathogenic identified cause disease kochs postulates however modern view pathogenicity depends microbial ecosystem whole bacterium participate opportunistic infections immunocompromised hosts acquire virulence factors plasmid infection become transferred different site within host respond changes overall numbers bacteria present example infection mesenteric lymph glands mice yersinia clear continuing infection sites lactobacillus possibly mechanism immunological scarring6
related conceptsedit
virulenceedit
virulence tendency pathogen cause damage hosts fitness evolves pathogen spread diseased host despite host debilitated horizontal transmission occurs hosts species contrast vertical transmission tends evolve symbiosis period high morbidity mortality population linking pathogens evolutionary success evolutionary success host organism
evolutionary medicine found horizontal transmission host population might never develop tolerance pathogencitation needed
transmissionedit
main article transmission medicine
transmission pathogens occurs many different routes including airborne direct indirect contact sexual contact blood breast milk body fluids fecaloral route
types pathogensedit
bacterialedit
main article pathogenic bacteria
vast majority bacteria typically range micrometers length harmless beneficial humans however relatively small list pathogenic bacteria cause infectious diseases bacterial diseases highest disease burden tuberculosis caused bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis kills million people year mostly subsaharan africa pathogenic bacteria contribute globally significant diseases pneumonia caused bacteria streptococcus pseudomonas foodborne illnesses caused bacteria shigella campylobacter salmonella pathogenic bacteria also cause infections tetanus typhoid fever diphtheria syphilis leprosy
bacteria often killed antibiotics usually designed destroy cell wall expels pathogens making incapable producing proteins causing bacteria class bacteria without cell walls mycoplasma cause lung infections class bacteria must live within cells obligate intracellular parasitic chlamydia genus world leader causing sexually transmitted infection
viraledit
information viral disease
diseases caused viral pathogens include smallpox influenza mumps measles chickenpox ebola rubella
pathogenic viruses diseases mainly families adenoviridae picornaviridae herpesviridae hepadnaviridae flaviviridae retroviridae orthomyxoviridae paramyxoviridae papovaviridae polyomavirus rhabdoviridae togaviridae viruses typically range nanometers length7
fungaledit
main article pathogenic fungi
fungi comprise eukaryotic kingdom microbes usually saprophytes consume dead organisms cause diseases humans animals plants fungi common cause diseases crops plants typical fungal spore size 1–40 micrometers length
prionicedit
main article prion
according prion theory prions infectious pathogens contain nucleic acids abnormally folded proteins found characteristically diseases scrapie bovine spongiform encephalopathy disease creutzfeldt–jakob disease8
parasitesedit
main article human parasites
eukaryotic organisms protists helminths cause disease
algaledit
examples algae acting mammalian pathogen known well notably disease protothecosis protothecosis disease found dogs cats cattle humans caused type green alga known prototheca lacks chlorophyll
treatment health careedit
bacteria usually treated antibiotics viruses treated antiviral compounds eukaryotic pathogens typically susceptible antibiotics thus need specific drugs infection many pathogens prevented immunization small amount pathogens used vaccines make immunity stay alert strengthen defense insides prepare larger quantity virus ever getting inside hygiene critical prevention infection pathogens
sexual interactionsedit
many pathogens capable sexual interaction among pathogenic bacteria sexual interaction occurs cells species process natural genetic transformation transformation involves transfer donor cell recipient cell integration donor recipient genome recombination examples bacterial pathogens capable natural transformation helicobacter pylori haemophilus influenzae legionella pneumophila neisseria gonorrhoeae streptococcus pneumoniae9
eukaryotic pathogens often capable sexual interaction process involving meiosis syngamy meiosis involves intimate pairing homologous chromosomes recombination examples eukaryotic pathogens capable include protozoan parasites plasmodium falciparum toxoplasma gondii trypanosoma brucei giardia intestinalis fungi aspergillus fumigatus candida albicans cryptococcus neoformans9
viruses also undergo sexual interaction viral genomes enter host cell process involves pairing homologous genomes recombination process referred multiplicity reactivation examples viruses undergo process herpes simplex virus human immunodeficiency virus vaccinia virus9
sexual processes bacteria microbial eukaryotes viruses involve recombination homologous genomes appears facilitate repair genome damages inflicted genome pathogens defenses respective target hosts
