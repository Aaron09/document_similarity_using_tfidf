theoretical physics consists several different approaches regard theoretical particle physics forms good example instance phenomenologists might employ semi empirical formulas agree experimental results often without deep physical understandingc modelers also called modelbuilders often appear much like phenomenologists model speculative theories certain desirable features rather experimental data apply techniques mathematical modeling physics problemsd attempt create approximate theories called effective theories fully developed theories regarded unsolvable complicated theorists unify formalise reinterpret generalise extant theories create completely ones altogethere sometimes vision provided pure mathematical systems provide clues physical system might modeledf notion riemann others space might curved theoretical problems need computational investigation often concern computational physics

notes



debate whether theoretical physics uses mathematics build intuition illustrativeness extract physical insight especially normal experience fails rather tool formalizing theories links question using mathematics less formally rigorous intuitive heuristic mathematical physics
sometimes word theory used ambiguously sense describe scientific theories research subfields programmes examples relativity theory quantum field theory string theory
work johann balmer johannes rydberg spectroscopy semiempirical mass formula nuclear physics good candidates examples approach
ptolemaic copernican models solar system bohr model hydrogen atoms nuclear shell model good candidates examples approach
arguably celebrated theories physics newtons theory gravitation einsteins theory relativity maxwells theory electromagnetism share attributes
approach often favoured pure mathematicians mathematical physicists
