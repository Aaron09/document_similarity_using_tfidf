lithograph mathieu orfila


dioscorides greek physician court roman emperor nero made first attempt classify plants according toxic therapeutic effect2 wahshiyya wrote book poisons 10th century3 followed 1360 khagendra mani darpana4
mathieu orfila considered modern father toxicology given subject first formal treatment 1813 traité poisons also called toxicologie générale5
1850 jean stas became first person successfully isolate plant poisons human tissue allowed identify nicotine poison famous bocarmé murder case providing evidence needed convict belgian count hippolyte visart bocarmé killing brotherinlaw6
theophrastus phillipus auroleus bombastus hohenheim 1493–1541 also referred paracelsus belief studies beyond work celsus roman physician first century also considered father toxicology7 credited classic toxicology maxim alle dinge sind gift nichts ohne gift allein dosis macht dass ding kein gift translates things poisonous nothing without poison dose makes thing poisonous often condensed dose makes poison latin sola dosis facit venenum830

testing methodsedit
toxicity experiments conducted vivo using whole animal vitro testing isolated cells tissues silico computer simulation11
nonhuman animalsedit
classic experimental tool toxicology testing nonhuman animals8 example model organism galleria mellonella replace small mammals study toxicology vivo12 2014 animal testing provides information available means substances function living organism13
alternative testing methodsedit
testing animal models remains method estimating human effects ethical technical concerns animal testing14
since late 1950s field toxicology sought reduce eliminate animal testing rubric three reduce number experiments animals minimum necessary refine experiments cause less suffering replace vivo experiments types simple forms life possible1516

dose response complexitiesedit
chemicals display classic dose response curve dose threshold effect observed880 show phenomenon known sufficient challenge small exposure produces animals grow rapidly better general appearance coat quality fewer tumors live longer control animals21 chemicals welldefined safe level exposure treated special care chemicals subject bioaccumulation stored rather excreted body885–90 also receive special consideration
several measures commonly used describe toxic dosages according degree effect organism population specifically defined various laws organizational usage include

ld50 median lethal dose dose kill exposed population
noel observed effect level highest dose known show effect
noael observed adverse effect level highest dose known show adverse effects
personal exposure limit highest concentration permitted osha regulations
stel shortterm exposure limit highest concentration permitted short periods time general 15–30 minutes
timeweighted average average amount agents concentration specified period time usually hours
threshold toxicological concern established constituents tobacco smoke22

requirementsedit
work toxicologist obtain degree toxicology related degree like biology chemistry biochemistry bachelors degree programs toxicology cover chemical makeup toxins effects biochemistry physiology ecology introductory life science courses complete students typically enroll labs apply toxicology principles research studies advanced students delve specific sectors like pharmaceutical industry enforcement apply methods toxicology work society toxicology recommends undergraduates postsecondary schools dont offer bachelors degree toxicology consider attaining degree biology chemistry additionally advises aspiring toxicologists take statistics mathematics courses well gain laboratory experience courses student research projects internships
dutiesedit
toxicologists perform many duties including research academic nonprofit industrial fields product safety evaluation consulting public service legal regulation order research assess effects chemicals toxicologists perform carefully designed studies experiments experiments help identify specific amount chemical cause harm potential risks near using products contain certain chemicals research projects range assessing effects toxic pollutants environment evaluating human immune system responds chemical compounds within pharmaceutical drugs basic duties toxicologists determine effects chemicals organisms surroundings specific duties vary based industry employment example forensic toxicologists look toxic substances crime scene whereas aquatic toxicologists analyze toxicity level water bodies
compensationedit
salary jobs toxicology dependent several factors including level schooling specialization experience bureau labor statistics notes jobs biological scientists generally include toxicologists expected increase 2008 2018 notes increase could research development growth biotechnology well budget increases basic medical research biological science
