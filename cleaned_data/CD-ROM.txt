transfer ratesedit
cdrom drives rated speed factor relative music cdrom read rotational speed audio data transfer rate kibs commonly called data rate track moves along laser spot maintain linear velocity optical head moves different positions angular velocity varied inner edge outer edge speed rating cdrom kibs different speed rating dvds mibs
increasing speed disc spun data transferred greater rates example cdrom drive read speed spins disc 1600 4000 giving linear velocity transfer rate 1200 kibs speed drives read constant angular velocity constant motor made change speed another head seeks place place disc mode number denotes transfer rate outer edge disc maximum thought maximum speed mechanical constraints samsung electronics introduced scr3230 cdrom drive uses ball bearing system balance spinning disc drive reduce vibration noise 2004 fastest transfer rate commonly available 10400 mibs higher spin speeds limited strength polycarbonate plastic discs made linear velocity outermost part disk around however improvements still obtained using multiple laser pickups demonstrated kenwood truex uses seven laser beams rotation speed approximately
first drive released late 199612 speed problems vibration heat drives give speeds outer edge disc rotational speed standard constant linear velocity slight increase however nature linear speed inner edge still increasing smoothly inbetween actual throughput increase less 3012 fact roughly average completely full disc even less partially filled
problems vibration owing limits achievable symmetry strength massproduced media mean cdrom drive speeds massively increased since late 1990s years later commonly available drives vary slimline portable units spin speed typically readonly units spin speed using achieve claimed speeds common even speeds cause poor reading drive error correction become sophisticated response even shattering poorly made physically damaged media small cracks rapidly growing catastrophic breakages centripetally stressed 10000–13000 40–52× high rotational speeds also produce undesirable noise disc vibration rushing spindle motor 21stcentury drives allow forced speed modes small utility programs sake safety accurate reading silence automatically fall back numerous sequential read errors retries encountered
methods improving read speed trialled using multiple optical beams increasing throughput spin speed along technologies like 9099 minute recordable media double density recorders utility nullified introduction consumer dvdrom drives capable consistent cdrom speeds higher additionally cdrom fully readable minutes increases actual data transfer rate decreasingly influential overall effective drive speed taken consideration factors loadingunloading media recognition spin updown random seek times making much decreased returns development investment similar stratification effect since seen development maximum speed stabilised exceptional cases capacity single dual layer higher speed capacity needs instead catered bluray drives
