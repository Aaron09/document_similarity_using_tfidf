train travels toward west case moves direction rotation therefore earths rotating frame coriolis term pointed inwards towards axis rotation additional force downwards cause train heavier moving direction

looks train fixed nonrotating frame center earth speed remains stationary earth spins beneath hence force acting gravity reaction track force greater 03443 force passengers train experience rest rotating along earth difference coriolis effect accounts rotating frame reference


train comes stop point view earths rotating frame velocity train zero thus coriolis force also zero train passengers recuperate usual weight

fixed inertial frame reference earth train rotates along rest earth force gravity provides centripetal force needed achieve circular motion frame reference remaining force measured scale makes train passengers lighter previous case


train travels east case moves direction earths rotating frame coriolis term directed outward axis rotation upward force makes train seem lighter still rest





graph force experienced kilograms object function speed moving along earths equator measured within rotating frame positive force graph directed upward positive speed directed eastward negative speed directed westward





fixed inertial frame reference earth train travelling east rotates twice rate rest—so amount centripetal force needed cause circular path increases leaving less force gravity track coriolis term accounts previous paragraph
final check imagine frame reference rotating along train frame would rotating twice angular velocity earths rotating frame resulting centrifugal force component imaginary frame would greater since train passengers rest would component frame explaining train passengers lighter previous cases
