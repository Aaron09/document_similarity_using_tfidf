introductionedit
topology formally defined study qualitative properties certain objects called topological spaces invariant certain kind transformation called continuous especially properties invariant certain kind invertible transformation called homeomorphism
topology also used refer structure imposed upon structure essentially characterizes topological space taking proper care properties convergence connectedness continuity upon transformation
topological spaces show naturally almost every branch mathematics made topology great unifying ideas mathematics
motivating insight behind topology geometric problems depend exact shape objects involved rather together example square circle many properties common dimensional objects topological point view separate plane parts part inside part outside
