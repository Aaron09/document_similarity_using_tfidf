history
strengthening asian monsoon linked uplift tibetan plateau collision indian subcontinent asia around million years ago10 studies records arabian windblown dust loess plateau china many geologists believe monsoon first became strong around million years recently studies plant fossils china longduration sediment records south china timing monsoon beginning 15–20 million years linked early tibetan uplift11 testing hypothesis awaits deep ocean sampling integrated ocean drilling program12 monsoon varied significantly strength since time largely linked global climate change especially cycle pleistocene ages13 study marine plankton suggested indian monsoon strengthened around million years periods level fell indonesian seaway closed happened cold waters pacific impeded flowing indian ocean believed resulting increase surface temperatures indian ocean increased intensity monsoons14
five episodes quaternary identified showed weakening leeuwin current weakening would effect surface temperature field indian ocean indonesian flow generally warms indian ocean thus five intervals could probably considerable lowering indian ocean would influenced indian monsoon intensity weak possibility reduced intensity indian winter monsoon strong summer monsoon change indian ocean dipole reduction heat input indian ocean indonesian flow thus better understanding possible links niño western pacific warm pool indonesian throughflow wind pattern western australia volume expansion contraction obtained studying behaviour quaternary close stratigraphic intervals15

process
monsoons largescale breezes occur temperature land significantly warmer cooler temperature ocean temperature imbalances happen oceans land absorb heat different ways oceans temperature remains relatively stable reasons water relatively high heat capacity k−117 conduction convection equilibrate cold surface deeper water metres contrast dirt sand rocks lower heat capacities k−118 transmit heat earth conduction convection therefore bodies water stay even temperature land temperature variable
warmer months sunlight heats surfaces land oceans land temperatures rise quickly lands surface becomes warmer expands area pressure develops meanwhile ocean remains lower temperature land retains higher pressure difference pressure causes breezes blow ocean land bringing moist inland moist rises higher altitude land flows back toward ocean thus completing cycle however rises still land cools decreases airs ability hold water causes precipitation land summer monsoons cause much rain land
colder months cycle reversed land cools faster oceans land higher pressure ocean causes land flow ocean humid rises ocean cools causes precipitation oceans cool flows towards land complete cycle
summer monsoons dominant westerly component strong tendency ascend produce copious amounts rain condensation water vapor rising intensity duration however uniform year year winter monsoons contrast dominant easterly component strong tendency diverge subside cause drought19
similar rainfall caused moist ocean lifted upwards mountains20 surface heating21 convergence surface22 divergence aloft stormproduced outflows surface23 however lifting occurs cools expansion lower pressure produces condensation
