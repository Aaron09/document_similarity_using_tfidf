losses antenna included gain
antenna gain directivityedit
antenna gain closely related directivity often incorrectly used interchangeably however gain always less directivity factor called radiation efficiency whereas directivity entirely function wavelength geometry type antenna gain takes account losses always occur real world specifically accelerating charge time varying current causes electromagnetic radiation maxwells equations therefore antennas current distribution radiating elements generate electromagnetic energy propagates away antenna coupling never efficient laws thermodynamics therefore antenna gain always less directivity efficiency factor
dipole isotropic radiatorsedit
calculated antenna gain given direction compared maximum directivity halfwave dipole antenna creates mathematically virtual effective dipole antenna oriented direction receiver words notional receiver given direction transmitter would receive power source replaced ideal dipole oriented maximum directivity matched polarization towards receiver antenna input power equal receiver would able determine difference maximum directivity ideal halfwave dipole constant therefore always less eirp ideal dipole antenna could replaced isotropic radiator purely mathematical device cannot exist real world receiver cannot know difference long input power increased
unfortunately distinction often left unstated reader sometimes forced infer used example yagiuda antenna constructed several dipoles arranged precise intervals create better energy focusing directivity simple dipole since constructed dipoles often antenna gain expressed listed obviously ambiguity undesirable respect engineering specifications yagiuda antennas maximum directivity 1092 gain necessarily must less factor must negative units neither eirp calculated without knowledge power accepted antenna correct units eirp assume 100watt transmitter losses prior antenna 2277dbw eirp 2492dbw less ideal assuming receiver first sidelobe transmitting antenna value reduced decrease directivity main sidelobe yagiuda therefore anywhere along sidelobe direction transmitter blind receiver could tell difference yagiuda replaced either ideal dipole oriented towards receiver isotropic radiator antenna input power increased
polarizationedit
polarization taken account properly must considering dipole radiator previously assumed perfectly aligned receiver assume however receiving antenna circularly polarized minimum polarization loss regardless antenna orientation receiver also dipole possible align orthogonally transmitter theoretically zero energy received however polarization loss accounted calculation eirp rather receiving system designer must account loss appropriate example cellular telephone tower fixed linear polarization mobile handset must function well arbitrary orientation therefore handset design might provide dual polarization receive handset captured energy maximized regardless orientation designer might circularly polarized antenna account extra loss amplification

united states regulatory usageedit

microwave band issuesedit
microwave systems completely nondirectional isotropic antenna radiates equally perfectly well every direction physical impossibility used reference antenna speaks eirp effective isotropic radiated power rather includes satellite transponders radar systems microwave dishes reflectors rather dipolestyle antennas
