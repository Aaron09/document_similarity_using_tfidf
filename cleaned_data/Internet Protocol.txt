internet protocol principal communications protocol internet protocol suite relaying datagrams across network boundaries routing function enables internetworking essentially establishes internet
task delivering packets source host destination host solely based addresses packet headers purpose defines packet structures encapsulate data delivered also defines addressing methods used label datagram source destination information
historically connectionless datagram service original transmission control program introduced vint cerf kahn 1974 connectionoriented transmission control protocol internet protocol suite therefore often referred tcpip

sample encapsulation application data link protocol frame


internet protocol responsible addressing hosts encapsulating data datagrams including fragmentation reassembly routing datagrams source host destination host across networks1 purposes internet protocol defines format packets provides addressing system
datagram components header payload header includes source address destination address metadata needed route deliver datagram payload data transported method nesting data payload packet header called encapsulation
addressing entails assignment addresses associated parameters host interfaces address space divided subnetworks involving designation network prefixes routing performed hosts well routers whose main function transport packets across network boundaries routers communicate another specially designed routing protocols either interior gateway protocols exterior gateway protocols needed topology network
version historyedit
1974 institute electrical electronic engineers ieee published paper entitled protocol packet network intercommunication2 papers authors vint cerf kahn described internetworking protocol sharing resources using packet switching among network nodes central control component model transmission control program incorporated connectionoriented links datagram services hosts monolithic transmission control program later divided modular architecture consisting transmission control protocol user datagram protocol transport layer internet protocol network layer model became known department defense internet model internet protocol suite informally tcpip
versions experimental versions used 1977 1979 following internet experiment note documents describe versions internet protocol prior modern version ipv4

comments internet protocol dated august 1977 describes need separate internet protocol functionalities previously combined proposes first version header using version field
proposed internet header format dated february 1978 describes version header uses 1bit version field
draft internetwork protocol description version dated february 1978 describes ipv2
internetwork protocol specification version dated june 1978 describes first protocol called ipv4 header different modern ipv4 header
latest header formats dated june 1978 describes another version ipv4 also header different modern ipv4 header
internetwork protocol specification version dated september 1978 first description ipv4 using header would standardized

reliabilityedit
design internet protocol suite adheres endtoend principle concept adapted cyclades project endtoend principle network infrastructure considered inherently unreliable single network element transmission medium dynamic terms availability links nodes central monitoring performance measurement facility exists tracks maintains state network benefit reducing network complexity intelligence network purposely located nodes
consequence design internet protocol provides besteffort delivery service characterized unreliable network architectural language connectionless protocol contrast connectionoriented communication various error conditions occur data corruption packet loss duplication routing dynamic meaning every packet treated independently network maintains state based path prior packets different packets routed destination different paths resulting outoforder delivery receiver
error conditions network must detected compensated participating nodes upper layer protocols internet protocol suite responsible resolving reliability issues example host buffer network data ensure correct ordering data delivered application
ipv4 provides safeguards ensure packet header errorfree routing node calculates checksum packet checksum routing node discards packet although internet control message protocol icmp allows notification routing node required notify either node errors contrast order increase performance since current link layer technology assumed provide sufficient error detection7 ipv6 header checksum protect
link capacity capabilityedit
dynamic nature internet diversity components provide guarantee particular path actually capable suitable performing data transmission requested technical constraints size data packets allowed given link facilities exist examine maximum transmission unit size local link path discovery used entire intended path destination
ipv4 internetworking layer ability automatically fragment original datagram smaller units transmission case provides reordering fragments delivered order9 ipv6 network perform fragmentation reassembly endtoend principle requires stations higherlayer protocols avoid exceeding networks mtu10
transmission control protocol example protocol adjusts segment size smaller user datagram protocol icmp disregard size thereby forcing fragment oversized datagrams11
securityedit
design phase arpanet early internet security aspects needs public international network could adequately anticipated consequently many internet protocols exhibited vulnerabilities highlighted network attacks later security assessments 2008 thorough security assessment proposed mitigation problems published12 internet engineering task force ietf pursuing studies13
