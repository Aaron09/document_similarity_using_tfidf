typesedit
response time reaction time movement time usually focus research reaction time four basic means measuring

simple reaction time motion required observer respond presence stimulus example subject might asked press button soon light sound appears mean collegeage individuals milliseconds detect auditory stimulus approximately milliseconds detect visual stimulus34 mean reaction times sprinters beijing olympics males females 1000 starts achieve respectively5 interestingly study also concluded longer female reaction times artifact measurement method used suggesting starting block sensor system might overlook female falsestart insufficient pressure pads authors suggested compensating threshold would improve falsestart detection accuracy female runners
recognition gonogo reaction time tasks require subject press button stimulus type appears withhold response another stimulus type appears example subject press button green light appears respond blue light appears
choice reaction time tasks require distinct responses possible class stimulus example subject might asked press button light appears different button yellow light appears jensen example instrument designed measure choice reaction time
discrimination reaction time involves comparing pairs simultaneously presented visual displays pressing buttons according display appears brighter longer heavier greater magnitude dimension interest

momentary attentional lapses considerable amount variability individuals response time tend follow normal gaussian distribution control researchers typically require subject perform multiple trials measure typical baseline response time calculated taking mean response time rarely effective method characterizing typical response time alternative approaches modeling entire response time distribution often appropriate6

galton differential psychologyedit
francis galton typically credited founder differential psychology seeks determine explain mental differences individuals first rigorous reaction time tests express intention determining averages ranges individual differences mental behavioral traits humans galton hypothesized differences intelligence would reflected variation sensory discrimination speed response stimuli built various machines test different measures including reaction time visual auditory stimuli tests involved selection 10000 women children london public1
donders experimentedit
first scientist measure reaction time laboratory franciscus donders 1869 donders found simple reaction time shorter recognition reaction time choice reaction time longer both3
donders also devised subtraction method analyze time took mental operations take place7 subtracting simple reaction time choice reaction time example possible calculate much time needed make connection
method provides investigate cognitive processes underlying simple perceptualmotor tasks formed basis subsequent developments7
although donders work paved future research mental chronometry tests without drawbacks insertion method often referred pure insertion based assumption inserting particular complicating requirement paradigm would affect components test assumption—that incremental effect strictly additive—was able hold later experimental tests showed insertions able interact portions paradigm despite donders theories still interest ideas still used certain areas psychology statistical tools accurately1

shepard metzlers mental rotation taskedit
main article mental rotation
shepard metzler 1971 presented pair threedimensional shapes identical mirrorimage versions another reaction time determine whether identical linear function angular difference orientation whether picture plane depth concluded observers performed constantrate mental rotation align objects could compared12 cooper shepard 1973 presented letter digit either normal mirrorreversed presented either upright angles rotation units degrees subject identify whether stimulus normal mirrorreversed response time increased roughly linearly orientation letter deviated upright degrees inverted degrees decreases reaches degrees authors concluded subjects mentally rotate image shortest distance upright judge whether normal mirrorreversed13
sentencepicture verificationedit
mental chronometry used identifying processes associated understanding sentence type research typically revolves around differences processing types sentences true affirmative false affirmative false negative true negative picture presented associated sentence falls categories subject decides sentence matches picture type sentence determines many processes need performed decision made according data clark chase 1972 carpenter 1971 sentences simplest take least time sentences1415

posners letter matching studiesedit
posner 1978 used series lettermatching studies measure mental processing time several tasks associated recognition pair letters simplest task physical match task subjects shown pair letters identify whether letters physically identical next task name match task subjects identify whether letters name task involving cognitive processes rule match task subjects determine whether letters presented vowels vowels
physical match task simple subjects encode letters compare make decision name match task subjects forced cognitive step making decision search memory names letters compare deciding rule based task also categorize letters either vowels consonants making choice time taken perform rule match task longer name match task longer physical match task using subtraction method experimenters able determine approximate amount time took subjects perform cognitive processes associated tasks18
