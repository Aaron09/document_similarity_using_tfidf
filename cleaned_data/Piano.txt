clavichord allows expressive control volume sustain quiet large performances halls harpsichord produces sufficiently loud sound especially coupler joins manuals twomanual harpsichord offers dynamic accentbased expressive control note harpsichord cant produce variety dynamic levels keyboard musical passage though player harpischord manuals alternate different stops settings harpsichord determine strings sound could include louder stop quieter stop piano offers best instruments combining ability play loudly perform sharp accents piano project piano concertos play larger venues dynamic control permits range dynamics including soft quiet playing8
cristoforis great success solving known prior example fundamental mechanical problem designing stringed keyboard instrument notes struck hammer hammer must strike string remain contact would damp sound stop string vibrating making sound means striking string hammer must lifted raised strings moreover hammer must return rest position without bouncing violently must return position ready play almost immediately depressed player repeat note rapidly cristoforis piano action model many approaches piano actions followed next century cristoforis early instruments made thin strings much quieter modern piano much louder sustain comparison clavichord—the previous keyboard instrument capable dynamic nuance weight force keyboard played
