unions enjoyed higher rates success locations greater access workplace organizing space determined employer acceptance benefit corporatist relationship state thus allowed participate directly official governance structure moreover fluctuations business cycles particularly rise fall unemployment rates inflation also closely linked changes union density62
labor legislationedit
labor lawyer thomas geoghegan attributes drop longterm effects 1947 tafthartley slowed halted labors growth many decades enabled management roll back labors previous gains63

first ended organizing grand 1930s scale outlawed mass picketing secondary strikes neutral employers downs short everything congress industrial organizations founder john lewis 1930s


second effect tafthartley subtler slowerworking hold organizing even quiet lowkey scale example tafthartley ended card checks tafthartley required hearings campaign periods secretballot elections sometimes hearings union could officially recognized

also allowed even encouraged employers threaten workers want organize employers could hold captive meetings bring workers office chew thinking union

tafthartley unionbusting started late 1960s continues today started profession labor consultants began convince employers could violate prolabor 1935 wagner fire workers fire deliberately exercising legal rights nothing would happen wagner never real sanctions

hadnt employers violating wagner along well first 1930s 1940s tried riots streets mass picketing secondary strikes tafthartley unions couldnt retaliate like would penalty fines jail sentences63
general scholars debate influence politics determining union strength countries argument political parties play expected role determining union strength leftwing governments generally promoting greater union density others contest finding pointing important counterexamples explaining reverse causality inherent relationship64
economic globalizationedit
recently unions become increasingly concerned impacts market integration wellbeing scholars begun assess whether popular concerns global race bottom reflected crosscountry comparisons union strength scholars foreign direct investment size countrys international trade percentage assess countrys relative degree market integration researchers typically find globalization affect union density dependent factors unions access workplace centralization bargaining65
sano williamson argue globalizations impact conditional upon countrys labor history66 united states particular traditionally relatively levels union density globalization appear significantly affect union density
employer strategiesedit




illegal union firing increased reagan administration continued since67


studies focusing narrowly labor movement corroborate comparative findings importance structural factors tend emphasize effects changing labor markets globalization greater extent bronfenbrenner notes changes economy increased global competition capital flight transitions manufacturing service economy greater reliance transitory contingent workers accounts third decline union density68
bronfenbrenner claims federal government 1980s largely responsible giving employers perception could engage aggressive strategies repress formation unions richard freeman also points role repressive employer strategies reducing unionization highlights state ideology antiunionism tacitly accepted strategies
goldfield writes overall effects globalization unionization particular case united states understated econometric studies subject69 writes threat production shifts reduces unions bargaining power even eliminate also claims effects globalization labors strength indirect present change towards neoliberal political context promoted deregulation privatization industries accepted increased employer flexibility labor markets
union responses globalizationedit




studies done kate bronfenbrenner cornell university show adverse effects globalization towards unions illegal threats firing70


regardless actual impact market integration union density workers organized labor engaged variety strategies limit agenda globalization promote labor regulations international context prominent example opposition labor groups free trade initiatives north american free trade agreement nafta dominican republiccentral american free trade agreement drcafta cases unions expressed strong opposition agreements extent pushed incorporation basic labor standards agreement pass71
however mayer written precisely unions opposition nafta overall jeopardized organized labors ability influence debate labor standards significant way72 clintons presidential campaign labor unions wanted nafta include side deal provide kind international social charter standards would enforceable domestic courts international institutions mickey kantor trade representative strong ties organized labor believed could unions come along agreement particularly given strong voice negotiation process72
became clear mexico would stand kind agreement critics labor movement would settle viable alternatives response part labor movement wanted declare open opposition agreement push naftas rejection congress72 ultimately ambivalence labor groups within administration supported nafta believe strengthening naftas labor side agreement much would cost votes among republicans would garner among democrats would make harder united states elicit support mexico73
graubart writes despite unions open disappointment outcome laborside negotiation labor activists including aflcio used side agreements citizen petition process highlight ongoing political campaigns struggles home countries74 claims despite relative weakness legal provisions sideagreement served legitimizing functioning giving certain social struggles kind standing
transnational labor regulationedit
unions recently engaged developing field transnational labor regulation embodied corporate codes conduct however obrien cautions unions peripherally involved process remain ambivalent potential effects75 worry codes could legitimizing effects companies actually live good practices companies could codes excuse distract attention repression unions
braun gearhart note although unions participate structure number agreements original interest codes conduct differed interests human rights nongovernmental activists unions believed codes conduct would important first steps creating written principles company would compelled comply later organizing contracts foresee establishment monitoring systems fair labor association authors point motivated power want gain insider status politically accountable constituency requires provide direct benefits76
contrast activists nongovernmental sector motivated ideals free accountability gain legitimacy political outsiders therefore interests unions likely align well interests draft monitor corporate codes conduct
arguing idea high union wages necessarily make manufacturing uncompetitive globalized economy labor lawyer thomas geoghegan busting

unions manner prime competing china countries work accident social democracies sweden france germany kept paying high wages industry thats smashed unions belief compete cost result quickly ended wrecking industrial base77

unions made attempts organize across borders eder observes transnational organizing phenomenon facilitated technological change78 nevertheless claims unions service global solidarity still largely national selfinterest argues unions global north becoming increasingly depoliticized south grow politically global differentiation production processes leads divergent strategies interests different regions world structural differences tend hinder effective global solidarity however light weakness international labor herod writes globalization production need globalization union strategies order contained herod also points local strategies united auto workers strike general motors 1998 sometimes effectively interrupt global production processes ways could advent widespread market integration thus workers need connected organizationally others around world effectively influence behavior transnational corporation79
