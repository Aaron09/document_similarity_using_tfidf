analog signal continuous signal time varying feature variable signal representation time varying quantity analogous another time varying signal example analog audio signal instantaneous voltage signal varies continuously pressure sound waves differs digital signal continuous quantity representation sequence discrete values take finite number values12 term analog signal usually refers electrical signals however mechanical pneumatic hydraulic human speech systems also convey considered analog signals
analog signal uses property medium convey signals information example aneroid barometer uses rotary position signal convey pressure information electrical signal voltage current frequency signal varied represent information
information conveyed analog signal often signal measured response changes physical phenomena sound light temperature position pressure physical variable converted analog signal transducer example sound recording fluctuations pressure sound strike diaphragm microphone induces corresponding fluctuations current produced coil electromagnetic microphone voltage produced condenser microphone voltage current said analog sound
analog signal theoretically infinite resolution practice analog signal subject electronic noise distortion introduced communication channels signal processing operations progressively degrade signaltonoise ratio contrast digital signals finite resolution converting analog signal digital form introduces constant lowlevel noise called quantization noise signal determines noise floor digital form signal general processed transmitted without introducing additional noise distortion analog systems difficult detect degradation occurs however digital systems degradation detected corrected well
