newtons laws motion three physical laws together laid foundation classical mechanics describe relationship body forces acting upon motion response forces precisely first defines force qualitatively second offers quantitative measure force third asserts single isolated force doesnt exist three laws expressed several ways nearly three centuries1 summarised follows



first
inertial frame reference object either remains rest continues move constant velocity unless acted upon force23


second
inertial reference frame vector forces object equal mass object multiplied acceleration object assumed mass constant


third
body exerts force second body second body simultaneously exerts force equal magnitude opposite direction first body



three laws motion first compiled isaac newton philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica mathematical principles natural philosophy first published 16874 newton used explain investigate motion many physical objects systems5 example third volume text newton showed laws motion combined universal gravitation explained keplers laws planetary motion

isaac newton 1643–1727 physicist formulated laws


newtons laws applied objects idealised single point masses9 sense size shape objects body neglected focus motion easily done object small compared distances involved analysis deformation rotation body importance even planet idealised particle analysis orbital motion around star
original form newtons laws motion adequate characterise motion rigid bodies deformable bodies leonhard euler 1750 introduced generalisation newtons laws motion rigid bodies called eulers laws motion later applied well deformable bodies assumed continuum body represented assemblage discrete particles governed newtons laws motion eulers laws derived newtons laws eulers laws however taken axioms describing laws motion extended bodies independently particle structure10
newtons laws hold respect certain frames reference called newtonian inertial reference frames authors interpret first defining inertial reference frame point view second holds observation made inertial reference frame therefore first cannot proved special case second authors treat first corollary second1112 explicit concept inertial frame reference developed long newtons death
given interpretation mass acceleration momentum importantly force assumed externally defined quantities common interpretation consider laws definition quantities
newtonian mechanics superseded special relativity still useful approximation speeds involved much slower speed light13

object rest stay rest unless force acts upon
object motion change velocity unless force acts upon

known uniform motion object continues whatever happens unless force exerted upon rest continues state rest demonstrated tablecloth skilfully whipped dishes tabletop dishes remain initial state rest object moving continues move without turning changing speed evident space probes continuously move outer space changes motion must imposed tendency object retain state motion absence forces moving object tends move along straight line path indefinitely

description newtons third contact forces27


third states forces objects exist equal magnitude opposite direction object exerts force second object simultaneously exerts force forces equal magnitude opposite direction −fb28 third means forces interactions different bodies2930 different regions within body thus thing force accompanied equal opposite force situations magnitude direction forces determined entirely bodies body force exerted body body called action force exerted body body called reaction sometimes referred actionreaction called action reaction situations magnitude directions forces determined jointly bodies isnt necessary identify force action reaction action reaction simultaneous matter called action called reaction forces part single interaction neither force exists without other28
forces newtons third type road exerts forward frictional force accelerating cars tires also frictional force newtons third predicts tires pushing backward road
conceptual standpoint newtons third seen person walks push floor floor pushes person similarly tires push road road pushes back tires—the tires road simultaneously push swimming person interacts water pushing water backward water simultaneously pushes person forward—both person water push reaction forces account motion examples forces depend friction person example unable exert action force produce needed reaction force31

corpus omne perseverare statu quiescendi movendi uniformiter directum nisi quatenus viribus impressis cogitur statum illum mutare



translated english reads



every body persists state rest moving uniformly straight forward except insofar compelled change state force impressed32



ancient greek philosopher aristotle view objects natural place universe heavy objects rocks wanted rest earth light objects like smoke wanted rest stars wanted remain heavens thought body natural state rest body move straight line constant speed external agent needed continually propel otherwise would stop moving galileo galilei however realised force necessary change velocity body acceleration force needed maintain velocity words galileo stated absence force moving object continue moving tendency objects resist changes motion johannes kepler called inertia insight refined newton made first also known inertia—no force means acceleration hence body maintain velocity newtons first restatement inertia galileo already described newton appropriately gave credit galileo
inertia apparently occurred several different natural philosophers scientists independently including thomas hobbes leviathan33 17th century philosopher mathematician rené descartes also formulated although perform experiments confirm it3435

usual motion newtons name momentum hence careful distinction motion velocity
newton used third derive conservation momentum39 deeper perspective however conservation momentum fundamental idea derived noethers theorem galilean invariance holds cases newtons third appears fail instance force fields well particles carry momentum quantum mechanics
importance range validity
newtons laws verified experiment observation years excellent approximations scales speeds everyday life newtons laws motion together universal gravitation mathematical techniques calculus provided first time unified quantitative explanation wide range physical phenomena
three laws hold good approximation macroscopic objects everyday conditions however newtons laws combined universal gravitation classical electrodynamics inappropriate certain circumstances notably small scales high speeds special relativity lorentz factor must included expression momentum along rest mass velocity strong gravitational fields therefore laws cannot used explain phenomena conduction electricity semiconductor optical properties substances errors nonrelativistically corrected systems superconductivity explanation phenomena requires sophisticated physical theories including general relativity quantum field theory
quantum mechanics concepts force momentum position defined linear operators operate quantum state speeds much lower speed light newtons laws exact operators classical objects speeds comparable speed light second holds original form dpdt fourvectors
relationship conservation laws
modern physics laws conservation momentum energy angular momentum general validity newtons laws since apply light matter classical nonclassical physics
stated simply momentum energy angular momentum cannot created destroyed
force time derivative momentum concept force redundant subordinate conservation momentum used fundamental theories quantum mechanics quantum electrodynamics general relativity standard model explains detail three fundamental forces known gauge forces originate exchange virtual particles forces gravity fermionic degeneracy pressure also arise momentum conservation indeed conservation 4momentum inertial motion curved spacetime results call gravitational force general relativity theory application space derivative momentum operator quantum mechanics overlapping wave functions pair fermions particles halfinteger spin results shifts maxima compound wavefunction away observable repulsion fermions
newton stated third within worldview assumed instantaneous action distance material particles however prepared philosophical criticism action distance context stated famous phrase feign hypotheses modern physics action distance completely eliminated except subtle effects involving quantum entanglement particular refers bells theorem local model reproduce predictions quantum theory despite approximation modern engineering practical applications involving motion vehicles satellites concept action distance used extensively
discovery second thermodynamics carnot 19th century showed every physical quantity conserved time thus disproving validity inducing opposite metaphysical view newtons laws hence steadystate worldview based solely newtons laws conservation laws take entropy account
