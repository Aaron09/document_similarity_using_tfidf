onion dome royal observatory greenwich housing 28inch refracting telescope remaining segment william herschels 120centimetre diameter reflecting telescope called 40foot telescope focal length foreground


earliest existing record telescope 1608 patent submitted government netherlands middelburg spectacle maker hans lippershey refracting telescope3 actual inventor unknown word spread europe galileo heard 1609 built version made telescopic observations celestial objects45
idea objective lightgathering element could mirror instead lens investigated soon invention refracting telescope6 potential advantages using parabolic mirrors—reduction spherical aberration chromatic aberration—led many proposed designs several attempts build reflecting telescopes7 1668 isaac newton built first practical reflecting telescope design bears name newtonian reflector
invention achromatic lens 1733 partially corrected color aberrations present simple lens enabled construction shorter functional refracting telescopes reflecting telescopes though limited color problems seen refractors hampered fast tarnishing speculum metal mirrors employed 18th early 19th century—a problem alleviated introduction silver coated glass mirrors 18578 aluminized mirrors 19329 maximum physical size limit refracting telescopes meter inches dictating vast majority large optical researching telescopes built since turn 20th century reflectors largest reflecting telescopes currently objectives larger feet work underway several 3040m designs

name telescope covers wide range instruments detect electromagnetic radiation major differences astronomers must collecting light electromagnetic radiation different frequency bands
telescopes classified wavelengths light detect

xray telescopes using shorter wavelengths ultraviolet light
ultraviolet telescopes using shorter wavelengths visible light
optical telescopes using visible light
infrared telescopes using longer wavelengths visible light
submillimetre telescopes using longer wavelengths infrared light
fresnel imager optical lens technology
xray optics optics certain xray wavelengths

wavelengths become longer becomes easier antenna technology interact electromagnetic radiation although possible make tiny antenna nearinfrared collected much like visible light however farinfrared submillimetre range telescopes operate like radio telescope example james clerk maxwell telescope observes wavelengths 0003 2000 uses parabolic aluminum antenna10 hand spitzer space telescope observing 0003 uses mirror reflecting optics also using reflecting optics hubble space telescope wide field camera observe frequency range 00002 00017 ultraviolet infrared light11
photons shorter wavelengths higher frequencies glancingincident optics rather fully reflecting optics used telescopes trace soho special mirrors reflect extreme ultraviolet producing higher resolution brighter images otherwise possible larger aperture mean light collected also enables finer angular resolution
telescopes also classified location ground telescope space telescope flying telescope also classified whether operated professional astronomers amateur astronomers vehicle permanent campus containing telescopes instruments called observatory

refracting telescope nice observatory


main article optical telescope
optical telescope gathers focuses light mainly visible part electromagnetic spectrum although work infrared ultraviolet12 optical telescopes increase apparent angular size distant objects well apparent brightness order image observed photographed studied sent computer telescopes work employing curved optical elements usually made glass lenses andor mirrors gather light electromagnetic radiation bring light radiation focal point optical telescopes used astronomy many nonastronomical instruments including theodolites including transits spotting scopes monoculars binoculars camera lenses spyglasses three main optical types

refracting telescope uses lenses form image
reflecting telescope uses arrangement mirrors form image
catadioptric telescope uses mirrors combined lenses form image

beyond basic optical types many subtypes varying optical design classified task perform astrographs comet seekers solar telescopes

gammaray telescopesedit
higher energy xray gammaray telescopes refrain focusing completely coded aperture masks patterns shadow mask creates reconstructed form image
xray gammaray telescopes usually earthorbiting satellites highflying balloons since earths atmosphere opaque part electromagnetic spectrum however high energy xrays gammarays form image telescopes visible wavelengths example type telescope fermi gammaray space telescope
detection high energy gamma rays shorter wavelength higher frequency regular gamma rays requires specialization example type observatory veritas high energy gammarays still photons like visible light whereas cosmic rays includes particles like electrons protons heavier nuclei
discovery 2012 allow focusing gammaray telescopes16 photon energies greater index refraction starts increase again16
highenergy particle telescopesedit
highenergy astronomy requires specialized telescopes make observations since particles metals glasses
types high energy particle telescopes imageforming optical system cosmicray telescopes usually consist array different detector types spread large area neutrino telescope consists large mass water surrounded array sensitive light detectors known photomultiplier tubes originating direction neutrinos determined reconstructing path secondary particles scattered neutrino impacts interaction multiple detectors energetic neutral atom observatories like interstellar boundary explorer detect particles traveling certain energies
