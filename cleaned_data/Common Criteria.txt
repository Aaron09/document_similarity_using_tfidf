common criteria evaluations performed computer security products systems

target evaluation product system subject evaluation

evaluation serves validate claims made target practical evaluation must verify targets security features done following

protection profile document typically created user user community identifies security requirements class security devices example smart cards used provide digital signatures network firewalls relevant user particular purpose product vendors choose implement products comply products evaluated case serve template products security target defined authors least ensure requirements relevant also appear targets document customers looking particular types products focus certified meets requirements
security target document identifies security properties target evaluation claim conformance evaluated sfrs security functional requirements established less allows vendors tailor evaluation accurately match intended capabilities product means network firewall meet functional requirements database management system different firewalls fact evaluated completely different lists requirements usually published potential customers determine specific security features certified evaluation
security functional requirements sfrs specify individual security functions provided product common criteria presents standard catalogue functions example state user acting particular role might authenticated list sfrs vary evaluation next even targets type product although common criteria prescribe sfrs included identifies dependencies correct operation function ability limit access according roles dependent another ability identify individual roles

evaluation process also tries establish level confidence placed products security features quality assurance processes

security assurance requirements sars descriptions measures taken development evaluation product assure compliance claimed security functionality example evaluation require source code kept change management system full functional testing performed common criteria provides catalogue requirements vary evaluation next requirements particular targets types products documented respectively
evaluation assurance level numerical rating describing depth rigor evaluation corresponds package security assurance requirements sars covers complete development product given level strictness common criteria lists seven levels basic therefore cheapest implement evaluate stringent expensive normally author select assurance requirements individually choose packages possibly augmenting requirements areas requirements higher level higher eals necessarily imply better security mean claimed security assurance extensively verified

evaluated stscertified products components firewalls operating systems smart cards common criteria certification sometimes specified procurement standards containing interoperation system management user training supplement product standards examples include isoiec 17799 properly 77991 isoiec 27002 german itgrundschutzhandbuch
details cryptographic implementation within outside scope instead national standards like fips 1402 give specifications cryptographic modules various standards specify cryptographic algorithms

historyedit
originated three standards

itsec european standard developed early 1990s france germany netherlands unification earlier work approaches cesg evaluation scheme aimed defenceintelligence market green book aimed commercial adopted countries australia
ctcpec canadian standard followed standard avoided several problems used jointly evaluators canada ctcpec standard first published 1993
tcsec united states department defense 520028 called orange book parts rainbow series orange book originated computer security work including anderson report done national security agency national bureau standards eventually became nist late 1970s early 1980s central thesis orange book follows work done dave bell lapadula protection mechanisms

testing organizationsedit
testing laboratories must comply 17025 certification bodies normally approved either isoiec guide 45011
compliance 17025 typically demonstrated national approval authority

canada standards council canada program accreditation laboratories palcan accredits common criteria evaluation facilities ccef
france comité français daccréditation cofrac accredits common criteria evaluation facilities commonly called centre dévaluation sécurité technologies linformation cesti evaluations done according norms standards specified agence nationale sécurité systèmes dinformation anssi

mutual recognition arrangementedit
well common criteria standard also subtreaty level common criteria mutual recognition arrangement whereby party thereto recognizes evaluations common criteria standard done parties originally signed 1998 canada france germany united kingdom united states australia zealand joined 1999 followed finland greece israel italy netherlands norway spain 2000 arrangement since renamed common criteria recognition arrangement ccra membership continues expand within ccra evaluations mutually recognized including augmentation flaw remediation european countries within former itsec agreement typically recognize higher eals well evaluations eal5 tend involve security requirements host nations government
september 2012 majority members ccra produced vision statement whereby mutual recognition evaluated products lowered including augmentation flaw remediation vision indicates move away assurance levels altogether evaluations confined conformance protection profiles stated assurance level achieved technical working groups developing worldwide transition period fully determined
july 2014 ccra ratified goals outlined within 2012 vision statement major changes arrangement include

recognition evaluations collaborative protection profile evaluation assurance levels alcflr

common criteria certification cannot guarantee security ensure claims security attributes evaluated product independently verified words products evaluated common criteria standard exhibit clear chain evidence process specification implementation evaluation conducted rigorous standard manner
various microsoft windows versions including windows server 2003 windows certified security patches address security vulnerabilities still getting published microsoft windows systems possible process obtaining common criteria certification allows vendor restrict analysis certain security features make certain assumptions operating environment strength threats faced product environment additionally recognizes need limit scope evaluation order provide costeffective useful security certifications evaluated products examined level detail specified assurance level evaluations activities therefore performed certain depth time resources offer reasonable assurance intended environment

criticismsedit
august 2007 government computing news columnist william jackson critically examined common criteria methodology implementation common criteria evaluation validation scheme ccevs4 column executives security industry researchers representatives national information assurance partnership niap interviewed objections outlined article include

evaluation costly process often measured hundreds thousands dollars vendors return investment necessarily secure product
evaluation focuses primarily assessing evaluation documentation actual security technical correctness merits product evaluations eal5 higher experts national security agency participate analysis eal7 full source code analysis required
effort time necessary prepare evaluation evidence evaluationrelated documentation cumbersome time work completed product evaluation generally obsolete
industry input including organizations common criteria vendors forum generally little impact process whole

2006 research paper computer specialist david wheeler suggested common criteria process discriminates free open source software fosscentric organizations development models5 common criteria assurance requirements tend inspired traditional waterfall software development methodology contrast much foss software produced using modern agile paradigms although argued paradigms align well6 others attempted reconcile paradigms7 political scientist kallberg raised concerns lack control actual production products certified absence permanently staffed organizational body monitors compliance idea trust common criteria itsecurity certifications maintained across geopolitical boundaries8
