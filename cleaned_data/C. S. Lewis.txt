second chapter mere christianity lewis recognises many people find difficult understand human nature responds first idea moral simply herd instinct second idea moral simply social convention responding second idea lewis notes people often complain moral ideas better another actually argues existing real morality comparing moralities finally notes sometimes differences moral codes exaggerated people confuse differences beliefs morality differences beliefs facts

people exaggerate differences distinguished differences morality differences belief facts example said three hundred years people england putting witches death call rule human nature right conduct surely reason execute witches believe things really thought people going sold devil received supernatural powers return using powers kill neighbours drive bring weather surely would agree anyone deserved death penalty filthy quislings difference moral principle difference simply matter fact great advance knowledge believe witches moral advance executing think would call humane ceasing mousetraps believed mice house93
