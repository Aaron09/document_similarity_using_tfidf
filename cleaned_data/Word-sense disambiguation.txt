historyedit
first formulated distinct computational task early days machine translation 1940s making oldest problems computational linguistics warren weaver famous 1949 memorandum translation1 first introduced problem computational context early researchers understood significance difficulty well fact barhillel 1960 used example argue2 could solved electronic computer need general model world knowledge
1970s subtask semantic interpretation systems developed within field artificial intelligence starting wilks preference semantics however since systems time largely rulebased handcoded prone knowledge acquisition bottleneck
1980s largescale lexical resources oxford advanced learners dictionary current english oald became available handcoding replaced knowledge automatically extracted resources disambiguation still knowledgebased dictionarybased
1990s statistical revolution swept computational linguistics became paradigm problem apply supervised machine learning techniques
2000s supervised techniques reach plateau accuracy attention shifted coarsergrained senses domain adaptation semisupervised unsupervised corpusbased systems combinations different methods return knowledgebased systems graphbased methods still supervised systems continue perform best
difficultiesedit
differences dictionariesedit
problem word sense disambiguation deciding senses cases like word bass least senses obviously different cases however different senses closely related meaning metaphorical metonymic extension another cases division words senses becomes much difficult different dictionaries thesauruses provide different divisions words senses solution researchers used choose particular dictionary senses generally however research results using broad distinctions senses much better using narrow ones34 however given lack fullfledged coarsegrained sense inventory researchers continue work finegrained
research field performed using wordnet reference sense inventory english wordnet computational lexicon encodes concepts synonym sets concept encoded auto automobile machine motorcar resources used disambiguation purposes include rogets thesaurus5 wikipedia6 recently babelnet multilingual encyclopedic dictionary used multilingual wsd7
partofspeech taggingedit
real test partofspeech tagging sense tagging closely related potentially making constraints question whether tasks kept together decoupled still unanimously resolved recently scientists incline test things separately sensevalsemeval competitions parts speech provided input text disambiguate
instructive compare word sense disambiguation problem problem partofspeech tagging involve disambiguating tagging words senses parts speech however algorithms used tend work well mainly part speech word primarily determined immediately adjacent three words whereas sense word determined words away success rate partofspeech tagging algorithms present much higher stateofthe around 95citation needed accuracy better compared less 75citation needed accuracy word sense disambiguation supervised learning figures typical english different languages
interjudge varianceedit
another problem interjudge variance systems normally tested results task compared human however relatively easy assign parts speech text training people senses difficult8 users memorize possible parts speech word take often impossible individuals memorize senses word take moreover humans agree task hand give list senses sentences humans always agree word belongs sense9
human performance serves standard upper bound computer performance human performance however much better coarsegrained finegrained distinctions research coarsegrained distinctions1011 test recent evaluation exercises34
pragmaticsedit
researchers like douglas lenat argue cannot parse meanings words without form common sense ontology linguistic issue called pragmatics example comparing sentences

jill mary mothers independently mother
jill mary sisters sisters

properly identify senses words must know common sense facts12 moreover sometimes common sense needed disambiguate words like pronouns case anaphoras cataphoras text
sense inventory algorithms taskdependencyedit
taskindependent sense inventory coherent concept13 task requires division word meaning senses relevant task example ambiguity mouse animal device relevant englishfrench machine translation relevant information retrieval opposite true river requires choice french fleuve flows rivière flows river
also completely different algorithms might required different applications machine translation problem takes form target word selection senses words target language often correspond significant meaning distinctions source language bank could translate french banque—that financial bank rive—that edge river information retrieval sense inventory necessarily required enough know word used sense query retrieved document sense unimportant
discreteness sensesedit
finally notion word sense slippery controversial people agree distinctions coarsegrained homograph level writing instrument enclosure level finegrained polysemy disagreements arise example senseval2 used finegrained sense distinctions human annotators agreed word occurrences14 word meaning principle infinitely variable context sensitive divide easily distinct discrete submeanings15 lexicographers frequently discover corpora loose overlapping word meanings standard conventional meanings extended modulated exploited bewildering variety ways lexicography generalize corpus definitions evoke explain full range meaning word making seem like words wellbehaved semantically however clear meaning distinctions applicable computational applications decisions lexicographers usually driven considerations recently task named lexical substitution proposed possible solution sense discreteness problem16 task consists providing substitute word context preserves meaning original word potentially substitutes chosen full lexicon target language thus overcoming discreteness
approaches methodsedit
natural language processing main approaches deep approaches shallow approaches
deep approaches presume access comprehensive body world knowledge knowledge fishing type fish frequency sounds songs frequency sounds parts types fish used determine sense word bass used approaches successful practice mainly body knowledge exist computerreadable format outside limited domains17 however knowledge exist deep approaches would much accurate shallow approachescitation needed also long tradition computational linguistics trying approaches terms coded knowledge cases hard clearly whether knowledge involved linguistic world knowledge first attempt margaret masterman colleagues cambridge language research unit england 1950s attempt used data punchedcard version rogets thesaurus numbered heads indicator topics looked repetitions text using intersection algorithm successful18 strong relationships later work especially yarowskys machine learning optimisation thesaurus method 1990s
shallow approaches dont understand text consider surrounding words using information bass words fishing nearby probably fish sense bass words music song nearby probably music sense rules automatically derived computer using training corpus words tagged word senses approach theoretically powerful deep approaches gives superior results practice computers limited world knowledge however confused sentences like dogs bark tree contains word bark near tree dogs
four conventional approaches

dictionary knowledgebased methods rely primarily dictionaries thesauri lexical knowledge bases without using corpus evidence
semisupervised minimally supervised methods make secondary source knowledge small annotated corpus seed data bootstrapping process wordaligned bilingual corpus
supervised methods make senseannotated corpora train
unsupervised methods eschew almost completely external information work directly unannotated corpora methods also known name word sense discrimination

almost approaches normally work defining window content words around word disambiguated corpus statistically analyzing surrounding words shallow approaches used train disambiguate naïve bayes classifiers decision trees recent research kernelbased methods support vector machines shown superior performance supervised learning graphbased approaches also gained much attention research community currently achieve performance close state
dictionary knowledgebased methodsedit
lesk algorithm19 seminal dictionarybased method based hypothesis words used together text related relation observed definitions words senses words disambiguated finding pair dictionary senses greatest word overlap dictionary definitions example disambiguating words pine cone definitions appropriate senses include words evergreen tree least dictionary similar approach20 searches shortest path words second word iteratively searched among definitions every semantic variant first word among definitions every semantic variant word previous definitions finally first word disambiguated selecting semantic variant minimizes distance first second word
alternative definitions consider general wordsense relatedness compute semantic similarity pair word senses based given lexical knowledge base wordnet graphbased methods reminiscent spreading activation research early days research applied success complex graphbased approaches shown perform almost well supervised methods21 even outperforming specific domains322 recently reported simple graph connectivity measures degree perform stateoftheart presence sufficiently rich lexical knowledge base23 also automatically transferring knowledge form semantic relations wikipedia wordnet shown boost simple knowledgebased methods enabling rival best supervised systems even outperform domainspecific setting24
selectional preferences selectional restrictions also useful example knowing typically cooks food disambiguate word bass cooking basses musical instrument
supervised methodsedit
supervised methods based assumption context provide enough evidence disambiguate words hence common sense reasoning deemed unnecessary probably every machine learning algorithm going applied including associated techniques feature selection parameter optimization ensemble learning support vector machines memorybased learning shown successful approaches date probably cope highdimensionality feature space however supervised methods subject knowledge acquisition bottleneck since rely substantial amounts manually sensetagged corpora training laborious expensive create
semisupervised methodsedit
lack training data many word sense disambiguation algorithms semisupervised learning allows labeled unlabeled data yarowsky algorithm early example algorithm25 uses ‘one sense collocation’ ‘one sense discourse’ properties human languages word sense disambiguation observation words tend exhibit sense given discourse given collocation
bootstrapping approach starts small amount seed data word either manually tagged training examples small number surefire decision rules play context bass almost always indicates musical instrument seeds used train initial classifier using supervised method classifier used untagged portion corpus extract larger training confident classifications included process repeats classifier trained successively larger training corpus whole corpus consumed given maximum number iterations reached
semisupervised techniques large quantities untagged corpora provide cooccurrence information supplements tagged corpora techniques potential help adaptation supervised models different domains
also ambiguous word language often translated different words second language depending sense word wordaligned bilingual corpora used infer crosslingual sense distinctions kind semisupervised system
unsupervised methodsedit
main article word sense induction
unsupervised learning greatest challenge researchers underlying assumption similar senses occur similar contexts thus senses induced text clustering word occurrences using measure similarity context26 task referred word sense induction discrimination occurrences word classified closest induced clusterssenses performance lower methods described comparisons difficult since senses induced must mapped known dictionary word senses mapping dictionary senses desired clusterbased evaluations including measures entropy purity performed alternatively word sense induction methods tested compared within application instance shown word sense induction improves search result clustering increasing quality result clusters degree diversification result lists2728 hoped unsupervised learning overcome knowledge acquisition bottleneck dependent manual effort
approachesedit
approaches vary differently methods

disambiguation based operational semantics default logic29

languagesedit

hindi lack lexical resources hindi hindered performance supervised models unsupervised models suffer extensive morphology possible solution problem design model means parallel corpora3738 creation hindi wordnet paved several supervised methods proven produce higher accuracy disambiguating nouns39

local impediments summaryedit
knowledge acquisition bottleneck perhaps major impediment solving problem unsupervised methods rely knowledge word senses barely formulated dictionaries lexical databases supervised methods depend crucially existence manually annotated examples every word sense requisite handful words testing purposes done senseval exercises
therefore promising trends research using largest corpus ever accessible world wide acquire lexical information automatically40 traditionally understood intermediate language engineering technology could improve applications information retrieval case however reverse also true search engines implement simple robust techniques successfully used mining information employed therefore lack training data provoked appearing algorithms techniques described

evaluationedit
comparing evaluating different systems extremely difficult different test sets sense inventories knowledge resources adopted organization specific evaluation campaigns systems assessed inhouse often smallscale data sets order test ones algorithm developers spend time annotate word occurrences comparing methods even corpus eligible different sense inventories
order define common evaluation datasets procedures public evaluation campaigns organized senseval renamed semeval international word sense disambiguation competition held every three years since 1998 senseval1 1998 senseval2 2001 senseval3 2004 successor semeval 2007 objective competition organize different lectures preparing handannotating corpus testing systems perform comparative evaluation systems several kinds tasks including allwords lexical sample different languages recently tasks semantic role labeling gloss lexical substitution systems submitted evaluation competitions usually integrate different techniques often combine supervised knowledgebased methods especially avoiding performance lack training examples
recent years 20072012 evaluation task choices grown criterion evaluating changed drastically depending variant evaluation task enumerates variety tasks
task design choicesedit
technology evolves word sense disambiguation tasks grows different flavors towards various research directions languages

classic monolingual evaluation tasks wordnet sense inventory largely based supervisedsemisupervised classification manually sense annotated corpora44

classic english uses princeton wordnet sense inventory primary classification input normally based semcor corpus
classical languages uses respective wordnet sense inventories sense annotated corpora tagged respective languages often researchers also tapped semcor corpus aligned bitexts english source language


crosslingual evaluation task also focused across languages simultaneously unlike multilingual tasks instead providing manually senseannotated examples sense polysemous noun sense inventory built basis parallel corpora europarl corpus45
multilingual evaluation tasks focused across languages simultaneously using respective wordnets sense inventories babelnet multilingual sense inventory46 evolved translation evaluation tasks took place senseval2 popular approach carry monolingual source language senses corresponding target word translations47
word sense induction disambiguation task combined task evaluation sense inventory first induced fixed training data consisting polysemous words sentence occurred performed different testing data set48
