extent debt owed foreign investors approximately half debt held public 2012 principal interest directly received heirs81
higher debt levels imply higher interest payments create costs future taxpayers higher taxes lower government benefits higher inflation increased risk fiscal crisis56
extent borrowed funds invested today improve longterm productivity economy workers useful infrastructure projects education future generations benefit83
every dollar intragovernmental debt obligation specific program recipients generally nonmarketable securities held social security trust fund adjustments reduce future deficits programs also apply costs future generations higher taxes lower program spendingcitation needed

krugman wrote march 2013 neglecting public investment failing create jobs harm future generations merely passing along debt fiscal policy indeed moral issue ashamed next generations economic prospects involves investing little borrowing much young workers face high unemployment studies shown income throughout careers result teacher jobs could affect quality education competitiveness younger americans84
