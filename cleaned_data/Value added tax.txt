valueadded avoids cascade effect sales taxing value added stage production reason throughout world gaining favor traditional sales taxes principle applies provisions goods services assessed collected value goods services provided every time transaction salepurchase seller charges buyer seller pays government however purchasers users goods services purchased costs business paid purchases deducted charge customers government receives difference words paid gross margin transaction participant sales chain
many developing countries india sales taxvat revenue sources high unemployment capita income render income sources inadequate however strong opposition many subnational governments leads overall reduction revenue collect well autonomy
theory sales normally charged users consumers mechanism means enduser would sales main disadvantage extra accounting required middle supply chain balanced simplicity requiring rules determine considered user system exemptions zealand payment even simpler
general economic idea sales taxes high enough people start engaging widespread evading activity like buying internet pretending business buying wholesale buying products employer hand total rates rise without widespread evasion novel collection mechanism however particular mechanism collection becomes quite easily target specific frauds like carousel fraud expensive terms loss incomes states
