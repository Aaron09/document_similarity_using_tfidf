state without work educated uneducated person earning ones livelihood meant unemployment economists distinguish various overlapping types theories unemployment including cyclical keynesian unemployment frictional unemployment structural unemployment classical unemployment additional types unemployment occasionally mentioned seasonal unemployment hardcore unemployment hidden unemployment
though several definitions voluntary involuntary unemployment economics literature simple distinction often applied voluntary unemployment attributed individuals decisions whereas involuntary unemployment exists socioeconomic environment including market structure government intervention level aggregate demand individuals operate terms much frictional unemployment voluntary since reflects individual search behavior voluntary unemployment includes workers reject wage jobs whereas involuntary unemployment includes workers fired economic crisis industrial decline company bankruptcy organizational restructuring
hand cyclical unemployment structural unemployment classical unemployment largely involuntary nature however existence structural unemployment reflect choices made unemployed past classical natural unemployment result legislative economic choices made labour unions political parties practice distinction voluntary involuntary unemployment hard draw
clearest cases involuntary unemployment fewer vacancies unemployed workers even wages allowed adjust even vacancies filled unemployed workers would still remain happens cyclical unemployment macroeconomic forces cause microeconomic unemployment boomerang back exacerbate macroeconomic forces
classical unemploymentedit
classical realwage unemployment occurs real wages marketclearing level causing number jobseekers exceed number vacancies hand economists argue wages fall livable wage many choose drop labor market longer seek employment especially true countries lowincome families supported public welfare systems cases wages would high enough motivate people choose employment receive public welfare wages livable wage likely result lower labor market participation stated scenario addition must noted consumption goods services primary driver increased need labor higher wages leads workers income available consume goods services therefore higher wages increase general consumption result need labor increases unemployment decreases economy
many economists argued unemployment increases increased governmental regulation example minimum wage laws raise cost lowskill laborers market equilibrium resulting increased unemployment people wish work going rate cannot higher enforced wage greater value labour67 laws restricting layoffs make businesses less likely hire first place hiring becomes risky7
however argument overly simplifies relationship wage rates unemployment ignoring numerous factors contribute unemployment89101112 murray rothbard suggest even social taboos prevent wages falling marketclearing level13
work unemployment government twentiethcentury america economists richard vedder lowell gallaway argue empirical record wages rates productivity unemployment american validates classical unemployment theory data shows strong correlation adjusted real wage unemployment united states 1900 1990 however maintain data take account exogenous events14

cyclical unemployment number unemployed workers exceeds number vacancies even full employment attained open jobs filled workers would still remain unemployed associate cyclical unemployment frictional unemployment factors cause friction partially caused cyclical variables example surprise decrease money supply shock rational economic factors suddenly inhibit aggregate demand
keynesian economists hand lack supply jobs potentially resolvable government intervention suggested interventions involves deficit spending boost employment demand another intervention involves expansionary monetary policy increases supply money reduce interest rates lead increase nongovernmental spending16

marxists share keynesian viewpoint relationship economic demand employment caveat market systems propensity slash wages reduce labor participation enterprise level causes requisite decrease aggregate demand economy whole causing crises unemployment periods economic activity capital accumulation investment phase economic growth continue
according karl marx unemployment inherent within unstable capitalist system periodic crises mass unemployment expected function proletariat within capitalist system provide reserve army labour creates downward pressure wages accomplished dividing proletariat surplus labour employees underemployment unemployed18 reserve army labour fight among scarce jobs lower lower wages
first glance unemployment seems inefficient since unemployed workers increase profits unemployment profitable within global capitalist system unemployment lowers wages costs perspective owners perspective wages benefit system reducing economic rents benefit workers capitalist systems unfairly manipulate market labour perpetuating unemployment lowers laborers demands fair wages workers pitted another service increasing profits owners
