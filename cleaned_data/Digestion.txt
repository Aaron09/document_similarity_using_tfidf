overview vertebrate digestion
vertebrates digestion multistage process digestive system starting ingestion materials often organisms ingestion usually involves type mechanical chemical processing digestion separated four steps

ingestion placing food mouth entry food digestive system
mechanical chemical breakdown mastication mixing resulting bolus water acids bile enzymes stomach intestine break complex molecules simple structures
absorption nutrients digestive system circulatory lymphatic capillaries osmosis active transport diffusion
egestion excretion removal undigested materials digestive tract defecation

underlying process muscle movement throughout system swallowing peristalsis step digestion requires energy thus imposes overhead charge energy made available absorbed substances differences overhead cost important influences lifestyle behavior even physical structures examples seen humans differ considerably hominids lack hair smaller jaws musculature different dentition length intestines cooking
major part digestion takes place small intestine large intestine primarily serves site fermentation indigestible matter bacteria resorption water digests excretion
mammals preparation digestion begins cephalic phase saliva produced mouth digestive enzymes produced stomach mechanical chemical digestion begin mouth food chewed mixed saliva begin enzymatic processing starches stomach continues break food mechanically chemically churning mixing acids enzymes absorption occurs stomach gastrointestinal tract process finishes defecation1
human digestion process
main article human digestive system





























upper lower human gastrointestinal tract


human gastrointestinal tract around meters long food digestion physiology varies individuals upon factors characteristics food size meal process digestion normally takes hours16
digestion begins mouth secretion saliva digestive enzymes food formed bolus mechanical mastication swallowed esophagus enters stomach action peristalsis gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid pepsin would damage walls stomach mucus secreted protection stomach release enzymes break food combined churning action stomach partially digested food enters duodenum thick semiliquid chyme small intestine larger part digestion takes place helped secretions bile pancreatic juice intestinal juice intestinal walls lined villi epithelial cells covered numerous microvilli improve absorption nutrients increasing surface area intestine
large intestine passage food slower enable fermentation flora take place water absorbed waste material stored feces removed defecation anal canal anus
neural biochemical control mechanisms
different phases digestion take place including cephalic phase gastric phase intestinal phase
cephalic phase occurs sight thought smell food stimulate cerebral cortex taste smell stimuli sent hypothalamus medulla oblongata routed vagus nerve release acetylcholine gastric secretion phase rises maximum rate acidity stomach buffered food point thus acts inhibit parietal secretes acid cell secretes gastrin activity cell secretion somatostatin
gastric phase takes hours stimulated distension stomach presence food stomach decrease distention activates long myenteric reflexes activates release acetylcholine stimulates release gastric juices protein enters stomach binds hydrogen ions raises stomach inhibition gastrin gastric acid secretion lifted triggers cells release gastrin turn stimulates parietal cells secrete gastric acid gastric acid hydrochloric acid lowers desired acid release also triggered acetylcholine histamine
intestinal phase parts excitatory inhibitory partially digested food fills duodenum triggers intestinal gastrin released enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei activating sympathetic fibers causing pyloric sphincter tighten prevent food entering inhibits local reflexes
breakdown nutrients

digestive hormones




action major digestive hormones


least five hormones regulate digestive system mammals variations across vertebrates instance birds arrangements complex additional details regularly discovered instance connections metabolic control largely glucoseinsulin system uncovered recent years

gastrin stomach stimulates gastric glands secrete pepsinogen inactive form enzyme pepsin hydrochloric acid secretion gastrin stimulated food arriving stomach secretion inhibited
secretin duodenum signals secretion sodium bicarbonate pancreas stimulates bile secretion liver hormone responds acidity chyme
cholecystokinin duodenum stimulates release digestive enzymes pancreas stimulates emptying bile gall bladder hormone secreted response chyme
gastric inhibitory peptide duodenum decreases stomach churning turn slowing emptying stomach another function induce insulin secretion
motilin duodenum increases migrating myoelectric complex component gastrointestinal motility stimulates production pepsin

significance
digestion complex process controlled several factors plays crucial role normally functioning digestive tract mouth pharynx esophagus typically weakly acidic saliva controls region digestive tract salivary amylase contained saliva starts breakdown carbohydrates monosaccharides digestive enzymes sensitive denature high environment
stomachs high acidity inhibits breakdown carbohydrates within acidity confers benefits denatures proteins digestion small intestines provides nonspecific immunity damaging eliminating various pathogenscitation needed
small intestines duodenum provides critical balancing activate digestive enzymes liver secretes bile duodenum neutralize acidic conditions stomach pancreatic duct empties duodenum adding bicarbonate neutralize acidic chyme thus creating neutral environment mucosal tissue small intestines alkaline 85citation needed
