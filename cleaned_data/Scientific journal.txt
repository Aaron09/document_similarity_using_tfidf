cover first volume philosophical transactions royal society first journal world exclusively devoted science


several types journal articles exact terminology definitions vary field specific journal often include

letters also called communications confused letters editor short descriptions important current research findings usually fasttracked immediate publication considered urgent
research notes short descriptions current research findings considered less urgent important letters
articles usually five twenty pages complete descriptions current original research findings considerable variations scientific fields journals—80page articles rare mathematics theoretical computer science
supplemental articles contain large volume tabular data result current research dozens hundreds pages mostly numerical data journals publish data electronically internet supplemental information also contains voluminous material appropriate main body article like descriptions routine procedures derivations equations source code nonessential data spectra miscellaneous information
review articles cover original research rather accumulate results many different articles particular topic coherent narrative state field review articles provide information topic also provide journal references original research reviews entirely narrative provide quantitative summary estimates resulting application metaanalytical methods
data papers articles dedicated describe datasets type article becoming popular journals exclusively dedicated established scientific data earth system science data
video papers recent addition practice scientific publications often combine online video demonstration technique protocol combined rigorous textual description45

formats journal articles vary many follow general imrad scheme recommended international committee medical journal editors articles begin abstract onetofourparagraph summary paper introduction describes background research including discussion similar research materials methods experimental section provides specific details research conducted results discussion section describes outcome implications research conclusion section places research context describes avenues exploration

improvements benefits unique values electronically publishing scientific journal easy availability supplementary materials data graphics video lower cost availability people especially scientists nondeveloped countries hence research results developed nations becoming accessible scientists nondeveloped countries6
moreover electronic publishing scientific journals accomplished without compromising standards refereed peer review process67
form online equivalent conventional paper journal 2006 almost scientific journals retaining peerreview process established electronic versions number moved entirely electronic publication similar manner academic libraries electronic version purchase paper copy important mostused titles

also academic journal costs
many scientists librarians long protested cost journals especially payments going large forprofit publishing housescitation needed allow researchers online access journals many universities purchase site licenses permitting access anywhere university appropriate authorization universityaffiliated users home elsewhere quite expensive sometimes much cost print subscription although reflect number people using license—while print subscription cost person receive journal sitelicense allow thousands people gain accesscitation needed
publications scholarly societies also known notforprofitpublishers usually cost less commercial publishers prices scientific journals still usually several thousand dollars year general money used fund activities scientific societies journals invested providing scholarly resources scientists thus money remains benefits scientific sphere
despite transition electronic publishing serials crisis persists10
