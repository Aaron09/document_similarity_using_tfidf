ornamentation colorationedit
common easily identified types dimorphism ornamentation coloration though always apparent difference coloration sexes within given species called sexual dichromatism commonly seen many species birds reptiles2 sexual selection leads exaggerated dimorphic traits used predominantly competition mates increased fitness resulting ornamentation offsets cost produce maintain suggesting complex evolutionary implications costs evolutionary implications vary species species3
exaggerated ornamental traits used predominantly competition mates implying sexual selection4 ornaments costly produce maintain complex evolutionary implications5 costs implications differ depending nature ornamentation colour mechanism involved
peafowl constitute conspicuous illustrations principle ornate plumage peacocks used courting display attracts peahens first sight might mistake peacocks peahens completely different species vibrant colours sheer size males plumage peahen subdued brown coloration6 plumage peacock increases vulnerability predators hindrance flight renders bird conspicuous general6 similar examples manifold birds paradise argus pheasants
another example sexual dichromatism nestling blue tits males chromatically yellow females believed obtained ingestion green lepidopteran larvae contain large amounts carotenoids lutein zeaxanthin7 diet also affects sexually dimorphic colours humaninvisible spectrum89 hence male birds although appearing yellow humans actually violettinted plumage seen females plumage thought indicator male parental abilities10 perhaps good indicator females shows good obtaining food supply carotenoid obtained positive correlation chromas tail breast feathers body condition11 carotenoids play important role immune function many animals carotenoid dependent signals might indicate health12
frogs constitute another conspicuous illustration principle types dichromatism frog species ontogenetic dynamic ontogenetic frogs common permanent color changes males females litoria lesueuri example dynamic frog temporarily color changes males breeding season13 hyperolius ocellatus ontogenetic frog dramatic differences color pattern sexes sexual maturity males display bright green white dorsolateral lines14 contrast females rusty silver small spots bright coloration male population serves attract females aposematic sign potential predators
females often show preference exaggerated male secondary sexual characteristics mate selection15 sexy hypothesis explains females prefer elaborate males select males dull color independent species’ vision16
similar sexual dimorphism mating choice also observed many fish species example male guppies colorful spots ornamentations females generally grey color female guppies prefer brightly colored males duller males17

size dimorphism shows correlation sexual cannibalism prominent spiders also found insects praying mantises size dimorphic wolf spider foodlimited females cannibalize frequently41 therefore high risk fitness males precopulatory cannibalism male selection larger females reasons higher fecundity lower rates cannibalism41 addition female fecundity positively correlated female body size large female body size selected seen family araneidae argiope species including argiope bruennichi method males evolved ornamentation including binding female silk proportionally longer legs modifying females mating female feeding providing nuptial gift response sexual cannibalism41 male body size selection cannibalism spider species nephila pilipes prominently selected less dimorphic species spiders often selects larger male size42
fishedit
finned fish ancient diverse class widest degree sexual dimorphism animal class fairbairn notes females generally larger males males often larger species malemale combat male paternal care sizes range dwarf males males times heavier females43
cases males substantially larger females example lamprologus callipterus type cichlid fish fish males characterized times larger females males increased size believed advantageous males collect defend empty snail shells female breeds44 males must larger powerful order collect largest shells females body size must remain small order breed must eggs inside empty shells grows large shells unable breed another example dragonet males considerably larger females possess longer fins
females small body size also likely beneficial chances finding unoccupied shell larger shells although preferred females often limited availability45 hence female limited growth size shell actually change growth rate according shell size availability46 words males ability collect large shells depends size larger male larger shells able collect allows females larger brooding nest makes difference sizes sexes less substantial malemale competition fish species also selects large size males aggressive competition males territory access larger shells large males fights steal shells competitors sexual dimorphism also occurs hermaphroditic fish species known sequential hermaphrodites fish reproductive histories often include sexchange female male strong connection growth individual mating system operates within47 protogynous mating systems males dominate mating many females size plays significant role male reproductive success48 males propensity larger females comparable unclear whether size increase growth spurt time sexual transition history faster growth changing individuals49 larger males able stifle growth females control environmental resources
social organization plays large role changing fish often seen fish change lack dominant male within social hierarchy females change often attain preserve initial size advantage early life either case females change males larger often prove good example dimorphism
cases fish males noticeable changes body size females morphological changes seen inside body example sockeye salmon males develop larger body size maturity including increase body depth hump height snout length females experience minor changes snout length noticeable difference huge increase gonad size accounts body mass50
sexual selection observed female ornamentation gobiusculus flavescens known twospotted gobies51 traditional hypotheses suggest malemale competition drives selection however selection ornamentation within species suggests showy female traits selected either femalefemale competition male mate choice51 since carotenoidbased ornamentation suggests mate quality female twospotted guppies develop colorful orange bellies breeding season considered favorable males52 males invest heavily offspring incubation leads sexual preference colorful females higher quality52

sexual dimorphism birds manifested size plumage differences sexes sexual size dimorphism varies among taxa males typically larger though always case birds prey hummingbirds species flightless birds5657 plumage dimorphism form ornamentation coloration also varies though males typically ornamented brightly colored sex58 differences attributed unequal reproductive contributions sexes59 difference produces stronger female choice since risk producing offspring species males contribution reproduction ends copulation species male becomes main caregiver plumage polymorphisms evolved reflect differences measures reproductive fitness body condition60 survival61 male phenotype sends signals females choose fittest available male
sexual dimorphism product genetics environmental factors example sexual polymorphism determined environmental conditions exists redbacked fairywren redbacked fairywren males classified three categories breeding season black breeders brown breeders brown auxiliaries60 differences arise response birds body condition healthy produce androgens thus becoming black breeders less healthy birds produce less androgens become brown auxiliaries60 reproductive success male thus determined success years nonbreeding season causing reproductive success vary years environmental conditions
migratory patterns behaviors also influence sexual dimorphisms aspect also stems back size dimorphism species shown larger males better coping difficulties migration thusly successful reproducing reaching breeding destination62 viewing evolutionary standpoint many theories explanations come consideration result every migration breeding season expected results shift towards larger male population sexual selection sexual selection strong factor environmental selection also introduced environmental selection support smaller chick size chicks born area allowed grow larger size even though normal conditions would able reach optimal size migration environment gives advantages disadvantages sort strength selection weakened environmental forces given greater morphological weight sexual dimorphism could also produce change timing migration leading differences mating success within bird population63 dimorphism produces large variation sexes members sexes multiple evolutionary effects take place timing could even lead speciation phenomenon variation becomes strongly drastic favorable towards different outcomes
sexual dimorphism maintained counteracting pressures natural selection sexual selection example sexual dimorphism coloration increases vulnerability bird species predation european sparrowhawks denmark64 presumably increased sexual dimorphism means males brighter conspicuous leading increased predation64 moreover production exaggerated ornaments males come cost suppressed immune function60 long reproductive benefits trait sexual selection greater costs imposed natural selection trait propagate throughout population reproductive benefits arise form larger number offspring natural selection imposes costs form reduced survival means even trait causes males earlier trait still beneficial long males trait produce offspring males lacking trait balance keeps dimorphism alive species ensures next generation successful males also display traits attractive females
differences form reproductive roles often cause differences behavior previously stated males females often different roles reproduction courtship mating behavior males females regulated largely hormones throughout birds lifetime65 activational hormones occur puberty adulthood serve activate certain behaviors appropriate territoriality breeding season65 organizational hormones occur critical period early development either hatching birds determine patterns behavior rest birds life65 behavioral differences cause disproportionate sensitivities anthropogenic pressures66 females whinchat switzerland breed intensely managed grasslands66 earlier harvesting grasses breeding season lead female deaths66 populations many birds often maleskewed sexual differences behavior increase ratio populations decline rapid rate66 also male dimorphic traits hormones like testosterone instead naturally occurring part development example plumage67
sexual dimorphism also influence differences parental investment times food scarcity example bluefooted booby female chicks grow faster males resulting booby parents producing smaller males times food shortage results maximization parental lifetime reproductive success68
sexual dimorphism also appear mating season species birds show dimorphic traits seasonal variation males species molt less bright less exaggerated color breeding season69 occurs species focused survival reproduction causing shift less ornate statedubious discuss
consequently sexual dimorphism important ramifications conservation however sexual dimorphism found birds thus important conservation many animals differences form behavior lead sexual segregation defined differences space resource use70 sexual segregation research done ungulates70 research extends bats71 kangaroos72 birds73 sexspecific conservation plans even suggested species pronounced sexual segregation71

females choose males appear strong healthy thus likely possess good alleles give rise healthy offspring133 species however females seem choose males traits improve offspring survival rates even traits reduce potentially leading traits like peacocks tail132 hypotheses explaining fact sexy hypothesis handicap principle
sexy hypothesis states females initially choose trait improves survival young preference become widespread females must continue choose trait even becomes harmful sons unattractive females since preference widespread receive matings134
