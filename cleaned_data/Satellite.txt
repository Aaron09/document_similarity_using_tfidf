context spaceflight satellite artificial object intentionally placed orbit objects sometimes called artificial satellites distinguish natural satellites earths moon
1957 soviet union launched worlds first artificial satellite sputnik since 6600 satellites countries launched according 2013 estimate 3600 remained orbit1 1000 operational2 rest lived useful lives become space debris approximately operational satellites lowearth orbit mediumearth orbit 20000 rest geostationary orbit 36000 large satellites launched parts assembled orbit dozen space probes placed orbit around bodies become artificial satellites moon mercury venus mars jupiter saturn asteroids4 comet
satellites used many purposes common types include military civilian earth observation satellites communications satellites navigation satellites weather satellites space telescopes space stations human spacecraft orbit also satellites satellite orbits vary greatly depending purpose satellite classified number ways wellknown overlapping classes include earth orbit polar orbit geostationary orbit
launch vehicle rocket places satellite orbit usually lifts launch land launched submarine mobile maritime platform aboard plane launch orbit
satellites usually semiindependent computercontrolled systems satellite subsystems attend many tasks power generation thermal control telemetry attitude control orbit control
