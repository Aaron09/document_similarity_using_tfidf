historyedit
1991 european union esprit named processbase started focus research project develop data model lifecycle information facility would suit requirements process industries time project duration elapsed consortium companies involved process industries established epistle european process industries step technical liaison executive initially individual companies members later changed situation three national consortia members pistep posccaesar norway uspinl netherlands later pistep merged posccaesar uspinl renamed uspi
epistle took work processbase project initially work involved standard called 10303221 referred step ap221 ap221 first time annex list standard instances ap221 data model including types objects standard instances would reference would knowledge base knowledge types objects early nineties epistle started activity extend annex become library object classes relationships steplib steplib activities group approx domain experts three member consortia spread various expertises electrical piping rotating equipment worked together define core classes
development steplib extended many additional classes relationships classes published open source data furthermore concepts relation types ap221 159262 data models also added steplib dictionary resulted development gellish english whereas steplib became gellish english dictionary gellish english structured subset natural english modeling language suitable knowledge modeling product modeling data exchange differs conventional modeling languages meta languages used information technology defines generic concepts also includes english dictionary semantic expression capability gellish english significantly increased extending number relation types used express knowledge information
modellingtechnical reasons posccaesar proposed another standard 10303 called 15926 epistle supported proposal continued modelling work thereby writing part 15926 part official international standard status since 2003
posccaesar started together reference data library added many specialized classes example ansi american national standards institute pipe pipe fittings meanwhile steplib continued existence mainly driven members uspi since clear interest industry libraries essence classes management board epistle decided core classes libraries shall merged part 15926 merging process finished part reference data part 15926 well 10303221 replaced annex june 2007 159264 signed technical specification
1999 work earlier version part started initially based schema useful recommendation available ontology language became available clear provided suitable environment part part passed first ballot 2005 implementation project started formal ballot technical specification planned december 2007 however decided split part part scope wide

upstream industryedit
norwegian industry association decided 15926 also known ontology instrument integrating data across disciplines business domains upstream industry seen enablers called next second generation integrated operations better integration across companies goal1
following projects currently running 2009

integrated operations high north iohn project working extending 15926 handle realtime data transmission preprocessing enable next generation integrated operations
environment project include environmental reporting terms definitions used epims environmentweb 15926

finalised projects include

integrated information platform project working establishing realtime information pipeline based open standards worked among others

daily drilling report including terms definitions 15926 standard became mandatory february 20082 reporting norwegian continental shelf norwegian petroleum directorate safety authority norway says quality reports improved considerably since

technical backgroundedit
main requirements still scope data model covers entire lifecycle facility refinery components pipes pumps parts since facility long time entails many different types activities myriad different objects became clear generic datadriven data model would required
simple example illustrate thousands different types physical objects facility pumps compressors pipes instruments fluids many properties combinations would modelled hardcoded fashion number combinations would staggering unmanageable
solution template represents semantics object property yyyy yyyy unit measure instance template refers applicable reference data

physical object induction motor
indirect property type class cold locked rotor time
base property type time
scale seconds

without able make reference classes internet impossible express information
