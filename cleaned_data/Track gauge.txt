selecting gauge tradeoff different pros cons

narrow gauge

cons lower speed less stability less load carrying capacity




broad gauge




pros higher speed stability capacity
cons higher cost demanding rightofway construction



generally wants speedstabilitycapacity wants economy often inverse relationship priorities addition constraints loadcarrying capacity axles problematic excessively wide gauge common misconception narrower gauge permits tighter turning radius practical purposes meaningful relationship gauge curvature12
narrow gauge railways usually cost less build usually lighter construction using smaller cars locomotives smaller loading gauge well smaller bridges smaller tunnels smaller structure gauge tighter curves narrow gauge thus often used mountainous terrain savings civil engineering work substantial also used sparsely populated areas potential demand temporary railways removed shortterm construction logging industry mining industry largescale construction projects especially confined spaces temporary permanent
broader gauge railways generally expensive build offer higher speed stability capacity routes high traffic greater capacity offset higher initial cost construction
single perfect gauge different environments economic considerations come play narrow gauge better suited difficult terrain andor routes traffic conversely wide gauge preferable direct unimpeded routes high traffic standard gauge intended strike reasonable balance factors also true russian gauges
addition general tradeoff another important factor standardization standard chosen equipment infrastructure training calibrated standard conversion becomes difficult expensive also makes easier adopt existing standard invent true many technologies including railroad gauges rail gauge particular breakofgauge often causes inefficiency excess merits particular gauge reduced cost greater efficiency greater economic opportunity offered common standard explains small number gauges predominate worldwide
