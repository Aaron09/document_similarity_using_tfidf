hierarchy biological classifications eight major taxonomic ranks family contains genera intermediate minor rankings shown


genus ˈdʒiːnəs genera taxonomic rank used biological classification living fossil organisms biology hierarchy biological classification genus comes species family binomial nomenclature genus name forms first part binomial species name species within genus

felis catus felis silvestris species within genus felis felis genus within family felidae

composition genus determined taxonomist standards genus classification strictly codified different authorities often produce different classifications genera general practices used however1 including idea newly defined genus fulfill three criteria descriptively useful

monophyly descendants ancestral taxon grouped together phylogenetic analysis clearly demonstrate monophyly validity separate lineage2
reasonable compactness genus expanded needlessly
distinctness respect evolutionarily relevant criteria ecology morphology biogeography sequences consequence rather condition diverging evolutionary lineages except cases directly inhibit gene flow postzygotic barriers

moreover genera composed phylogenetic units kind analogous genera3

useedit
scientific name genus called generic name generic epithet always capitalized plays pivotal role binomial nomenclature system naming organisms
binomial nomenclatureedit
main articles binomial nomenclature trinomen infraspecific names
rules scientific names organisms laid nomenclature codes employed speakers languages giving species single unique latinate name standard scientifically describing species lowerranked taxa binomial nomenclature generic name forms first half example gray wolfs binomial name canis lupus canis generic name shared wolfs close relatives lupus wolf specific name particular wolf specific name written lowercase followed subspecies names zoology variety infraspecific names botany especially longer names generic name known context typically shortened initial letter
animals typically grouped within subspecies simply written trinomen third name example dogs still similar wolves form part species distinct require separate treatment described lupus familiaris domestic wolves form many distinct subspecies including common wolf lupus lupus dingo lupus dingo breeds meanwhile scientifically distinguished
several divisions plant species therefore infraspecific names generally include contractions explaining relation example genus hibiscus marshmallow includes hundreds species apart rose sharon common garden hibiscus syriacus syrian rose sharon doesnt subspecies cultivars carry desired traits bright syriaca diana6 hawaiian hibiscus meanwhile includes several separate species since botanists agree divisions names species common specify source name using author abbreviations example arnottianus agray first specified work gray7 sister identified immaculate white hibiscus molokai separate species8 bates later reclassified subspecies arnottianus9 thus appears arnottianus immaculatus arnottianus agray subsp immaculatus mjroe dmbates considered mere variety arnottianus written arnottianus immaculatus
typeedit
also type genus type species type specimen
genus designated type although practice backlog older names without zoology type species generic name permanently associated type specimen type species specimen turn assignable another genus generic name linked becomes junior synonym remaining taxa former genus need reassessed
identical names synonyms homonymsedit
within kingdom generic name apply genus however many names assigned usually unintentionally different genera example platypus belongs genus ornithorhynchus although george shaw named platypus 1799 names thus synonyms however name platypus already given group ambrosia beetles johann friedrich wilhelm herbst 1793 name means different things homonym since beetles platypuses members kingdom animalia name could used johann friedrich blumenbach published replacement name ornithorhynchus 1800
however genus kingdom allowed bear scientific name generic name name taxon another rank kingdom governed different nomenclature code names form applying different taxa called homonyms although discouraged international code zoological nomenclature international code nomenclature algae fungi plants five thousand names kingdom instance

anura name order frogs also name noncurrent genus plants
aotus generic name golden peas night monkeys
oenanthe generic name wheatears water dropworts
prunella generic name accentors selfheal
proboscidea order elephants genus devils claws
name genus paramecia extinct algae also plural name genus paramecium supergroup also lead confusion

number reptile genera given number species genera species hundreds based data reptile database 2015


number species genera varies considerably among taxonomic groups instance among nonavian reptiles 1180 genera species species species 1150 species genera species figure11 however insect genera genera lasioglossum andrena 1000 species
species assigned genus somewhat arbitrary although species within genus supposed similar objective criteria grouping species genera much debate among zoologists whether large speciesrich genera maintained extremely difficult come identification keys even character sets distinguish species hence many taxonomists argue favor breaking large genera instance lizard genus anolis suggested broken different genera would bring species smaller manageable subsets12
