visual overview common language infrastructure


common language infrastructureedit
main article common language infrastructure
common language infrastructure provides languageneutral platform application development execution including functions exception handling garbage collection security interoperability implementing core aspects framework within scope functions tied language available across many languages supported framework microsofts implementation common language runtime serves execution engine framework programs execute supervision guaranteeing many properties behaviors areas memory management security exception handling
computer programs need compiled common intermediate language opposed compiled machine code upon execution architecturespecific justintime compiler turns code machine code improve performance however framework comes native image generator ngen performs aheadoftime compilation
assembliesedit
compiled code stored assemblies mandated specification assemblies stored portable executable file format common windows platform dynamiclink library executable files assembly consists files must contain manifest bearing metadata assembly complete name assembly confused file name disk contains simple text name version number culture public token assemblies considered equivalent share complete name
private also used creator assembly strong naming public token identifies private assembly signed creator pair typically person signing assembly sign assemblies strong name prior version assembly since creator possesses private strong naming required assemblies global assembly cache
starting visual studio 2015 native compilation technology allows compilation code universal windows platform apps directly machine code rather code must written either visual basicnet39
class libraryedit
framework includes standard class libraries class library organized hierarchy namespaces builtin application programming interfaces apis part either system microsoft namespaces class libraries implement many common functions file reading writing graphic rendering database interaction document manipulation class libraries available compliant languages class library divided parts clear boundary base class library framework class library
includes small subset entire class library core classes serve basic clr40 framework classes considered part reside mscorlibdll systemdll systemcoredll classes available framework well alternative implementations including compact framework microsoft silverlight core mono
superset refers entire class library ships framework includes expanded libraries including windows forms aspnet windows presentation foundation also extensions base class libraries adonet language integrated query linq windows communication foundation workflow foundation much larger scope standard libraries languages like comparable scope standard libraries java
introduction alternative implementations silverlight microsoft introduced concept portable class libraries allowing consuming library platform proliferation platforms approach failed scale pcls defined intersections surface platforms41 next evolutionary step standard library created retroactively based systemruntimedll based apis found silverlight platforms encouraged implement version standard library allowing reuse extant thirdparty libraries without versions standard library allows independent evolution library model layers within architecture42
nuget package manager platforms used retrieve thirdparty libraries project global library feed nugetorg43 private feeds maintained separately build server file system directory
modelsedit
atop class libraries multiple models used create apps framework supports console windows forms windows presentation foundation aspnet aspnet core apps default models offered alternative implementations framework console aspnet core available core mono used power xamarin models android macos retroactive architectural definition models showed early 2015 also applied prior technologies like windows forms
ccliedit
main article ccli
microsoft introduced ccli visual studio 2005 language means compiling visual programs within framework parts program still within unmanaged visual runtime specially modified parts translated code frameworks
assemblies compiled using ccli compiler termed mixedmode assemblies since contain native managed code dll44 assemblies complex reverse engineer since decompilers reflector reveal managed code
design principleedit
interoperabilityedit
computer systems commonly require interaction newer older applications framework provides means access functions implemented newer older programs execute outside environment access component object model components provided systemruntimeinteropservices systementerpriseservices namespaces framework access functions platform invocation services pinvoke access functions native applications reverse pinvoke function
language independenceedit
framework introduces common type system defines possible data types programming constructs supported interact conforming specification feature framework supports exchange types object instances libraries applications written using conforming language
type safetyedit
used framework also enforce type safety prevents illdefined casts wrong method invocations memory size issues accessing object also makes languages statically typed without type inference however starting framework dynamic language runtime extended allowing dynamically typed languages implemented atop
portabilityedit
microsoft never implemented full framework system except microsoft windows engineered framework crossplatform45 implementations available operating systems silverlight alternative implementations microsoft submitted specifications includes core class libraries cil464748 ccli50 ecma international ecma international organization standardization making available official standards makes possible third parties create compatible implementations framework languages platforms
securityedit
framework security mechanism general features code access security validation verification based evidence associated specific assembly typically evidence source assembly whether installed local machine downloaded internet uses evidence determine permissions granted code code demand calling code granted specified permission demand causes perform call stack walk every assembly method call stack checked required permission assembly granted permission security exception thrown
managed bytecode easier reverseengineer native code unless obfuscated5152 decompiler programs enable developers reverseengineering skills view source code behind unobfuscated assemblies contrast apps compiled native machine code much harder reverseengineer source code almost never produced successfully mainly compiler optimizations lack reflection53 creates concerns business community possible loss trade secrets bypassing license control mechanisms mitigate microsoft included dotfuscator community edition visual studio since 2002b thirdparty obfuscation tools also available vendors vmware labs xenocode gate software methodlevel encryption tools code available vendors safenet
memory managementedit
frees developer burden managing memory allocating freeing done handles memory management detecting memory safely freed instantiations types objects allocated managed heap pool memory managed long reference object exists either direct graph objects object considered reference object exists cannot reached used becomes garbage eligible collection
framework includes garbage collector runs periodically separate thread applications thread enumerates unusable objects reclaims memory allocated nondeterministic compacting markandsweep garbage collector runs amount memory used enough pressure memory system since guaranteed conditions reclaim memory reached runs nondeterministic application roots pointers objects managed heap managed objects include references static objects objects defined local variables method parameters currently scope objects referred registers54 runs pauses application object referred root recursively enumerates objects reachable root objects marks reachable uses metadata reflection discover objects encapsulated object recursively walk enumerates objects heap initially allocated contiguously using reflection objects marked reachable garbage54 mark phase55 since memory held garbage consequence considered free space however leaves chunks free space objects initially contiguous objects compacted together make free space managed heap contiguous again5455 reference object invalidated moving object updated reflect location55 application resumed garbage collection ends latest version framework uses concurrent garbage collection along user code making pauses unnoticeable done background56
used framework also generational57 objects assigned generation newly created objects tagged generation objects survive garbage collection tagged generation generation objects survive another collection generation framework uses generation objects57 higher generation objects garbage collected less often lower generation objects raises efficiency garbage collection older objects tend longer lifetimes newer objects57 thus eliminating older thus likely survive collection objects scope collection fewer objects need checking compacting57
performanceedit
application first launched framework compiles code executable code using justintime compiler caches executable program native image cache5859 caching application launches faster subsequent launches although first launch usually slower speed first launch developers native image generator utility manually aheadoftime compile cache application59
garbage collector integrated environment introduce unanticipated delays execution developer little direct control large applications number objects garbage collector needs work become large means take long time visit rearrange them60
framework provides support calling streaming simd extensions managed code april 2014 visual studio 2013 update however mono provided support simd extensions version within monosimd namespace 200961 monos lead developer miguel icaza expressed hope simd support adopted clrs ecma standard62 streaming simd extensions available cpus since introduction pentium architectures mips also simd extensions case lacks support extensions instructions simulated software63
alternative implementationsedit
framework predominant implementation technologies implementations parts framework exist although runtime engine described ecmaiso specification implementations encumbered patent issues standards include disclaimer attention drawn possibility elements document subject patent rights shall held responsible identifying patent rights64 harder develop alternatives described open standard subject copyright restrictions also parts windowsspecific functions behavior implementation nonwindows platforms problematic
alternative implementations parts framework listed

micro framework platform extremely resourceconstrained devices includes small version supports development though developers able vbnet65 albeit amount hacking limited functionalities debugging emulator hardware using microsoft visual studio also features subset framework class library classes methods framework loosely based additional libraries specific embedded applications
core alternative microsoft implementation managed code framework similarities framework even shares designed based different sets principles crossplatform free opensource
mono implementation provides added functions duallicensed free proprietary software includes support aspnet adonet windows forms libraries wide range architectures operating systems also includes vbnet compilers
portablenet part dotgnu provides implementation parts compiler supports variety cpus operating systems project discontinued last stable release 2009
microsoft shared source common language infrastructure nonfree implementation however last version runs windows updated since 2006 thus contain features version framework
crossnet66 implementation parts free software using open source license

coreedit
core free opensource managed software framework windows macos linux67 consists coreclr complete runtime implementation virtual machine manages execution programs coreclr comes improved justintime compiler called ryujit68c core also includes corefx partial fork fcl70 core shares subset framework apis comes part framework71 core contains corert native runtime optimized integrated compiled native binaries variant core library used uwp72 cores commandline interface offers execution entry point operating systems provides developer services like compilation package management73
core supports four crossplatform scenarios aspnet core apps commandline apps libraries universal windows platform apps implement windows forms render standard desktop software windows7174 core also modular meaning instead assemblies developers work nuget packages unlike framework serviced using windows update core relies package manager receive updates7174
