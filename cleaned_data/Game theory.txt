game typesedit
cooperative noncooperativeedit
main articles cooperative game noncooperative game
game cooperative players able form binding commitments externally enforced contract game noncooperative players cannot form alliances agreements need selfenforcing credible threats1
cooperative games often analysed framework cooperative game theory focuses predicting coalitions form joint actions groups take resulting collective payoffs opposed traditional noncooperative game theory focuses predicting individual players actions payoffs analyzing nash equilibria2
cooperative game theory provides highlevel approach describes structure strategies payoffs coalitions whereas noncooperative game theory also looks bargaining procedures affect distribution payoffs within coalition noncooperative game theory general cooperative games analyzed approach noncooperative game theory converse hold provided sufficient assumptions made encompass possible strategies available players possibility external enforcement cooperation would thus optimal games expressed noncooperative framework many instances insufficient information available accurately model formal procedures available players strategic bargaining process resulting model would high complexity offer practical tool real world cases cooperative game theory provides simplified approach allows analyze game large without make assumption bargaining powers
symmetric asymmetricedit

















asymmetric game


main article symmetric game
symmetric game game payoffs playing particular strategy depend strategies employed playing identities players changed without changing payoff strategies game symmetric many commonly studied games symmetric standard representations chicken prisoners dilemma stag hunt symmetric games somewho scholars would consider certain asymmetric games examples games well however common payoffs games symmetric
commonly studied asymmetric games games identical strategy sets players instance ultimatum game similarly dictator game different strategies player possible however game identical strategies players asymmetric example game pictured right asymmetric despite identical strategy sets players

zerosum game


main article zerosum game
zerosum games special case constantsum games choices players neither increase decrease available resources zerosum games total benefit players game every combination strategies always adds zero informally player benefits equal expense others12 poker exemplifies zerosum game ignoring possibility houses wins exactly amount ones opponents lose zerosum games include matching pennies classical board games including chess
many games studied game theorists including famed prisoners dilemma nonzerosum games outcome results greater less zero informally nonzerosum games gain player necessarily correspond loss another
constantsum games correspond activities like theft gambling fundamental economic situation potential gains trade possible transform game possibly asymmetric zerosum game adding dummy player often called board whose losses compensate players winnings

game imperfect information dotted line represents ignorance part player formally called information


important subset sequential games consists games perfect information game perfect information players know moves previously made players games studied game theory imperfectinformation gamescitation needed examples perfectinformation games include tictactoe checkers infinite chess go13141516
many card games games imperfect information poker bridge17 perfect information often confused complete information similar conceptcitation needed complete information requires every player know strategies payoffs available players necessarily actions taken games incomplete information reduced however games imperfect information introducing moves nature18
combinatorial gamesedit
games difficulty finding optimal strategy stems multiplicity possible moves called combinatorial games examples include chess games involve imperfect information also strong combinatorial character instance backgammon unified theory addressing combinatorial elements games however mathematical tools solve particular problems answer general questions19
games perfect information studied combinatorial game theory developed novel representations surreal numbers well combinatorial algebraic sometimes nonconstructive proof methods solve games certain types including loopy games result infinitely long sequences moves methods address games higher combinatorial complexity usually considered traditional economic game theory2021 typical game solved related field study drawing computational complexity theory game complexity concerned estimating computational difficulty finding optimal strategies22
research artificial intelligence addressed perfect imperfect information games complex combinatorial structures like chess backgammon provable optimal strategies found practical solutions involve computational heuristics like alphabeta pruning artificial neural networks trained reinforcement learning make games tractable computing practice1923

focus attention usually much best play game whether player winning strategy proven using axiom choice games even perfect information outcomes lose neither player winning strategy existence strategies cleverly designed games important consequences descriptive theory
discrete continuous gamesedit
much game theory concerned finite discrete games finite number players moves events outcomes many concepts extended however continuous games allow players choose strategy continuous strategy instance cournot competition typically modeled players strategies nonnegative quantities including fractional quantities
differential gamesedit
differential games continuous pursuit evasion game continuous games evolution players state variables governed differential equations problem finding optimal strategy differential game closely related optimal control theory particular types strategies openloop strategies found using pontryagin maximum principle closedloop strategies found using bellmans dynamic programming method
particular case differential games games random time horizon24 games terminal time random variable given probability distribution function therefore players maximize mathematical expectation cost function shown modified optimization problem reformulated discounted differential game infinite time interval
manyplayer population gamesedit
games arbitrary finite number players often called nperson games25 evolutionary game theory considers games involving population decision makers frequency particular decision made change time response decisions made individuals population biology intended model biological evolution genetically programmed organisms pass along strategy programming offspring economics theory intended capture population changes people play game many times within lifetime consciously perhaps rationally switch strategies26
stochastic outcomes relation fieldsedit
individual decision problems stochastic outcomes sometimes considered oneplayer games situations considered game theoretical authorsby modeled using similar tools within related disciplines decision theory operations research areas artificial intelligence particularly planning uncertainty multiagent system although fields different motivators mathematics involved substantially using markov decision processes mdpcitation needed
stochastic outcomes also modeled terms game theory adding randomly acting player makes chance moves moves nature27 player typically considered third player otherwise twoplayer game merely serves provide roll dice required game
problems different approaches modeling stochastic outcomes lead different solutions example difference approach mdps minimax solution latter considers worstcase adversarial moves rather reasoning expectation moves given fixed probability distribution minimax approach advantageous stochastic models uncertainty available also overestimating extremely unlikely costly events dramatically swaying strategy scenarios assumed adversary force event happen28 black swan theory discussion kind modeling issue particularly relates predicting limiting losses investment banking
general models include elements stochastic outcomes adversaries partial noisy observability moves players also studied gold standard considered partially observable stochastic game posg realistic problems computationally feasible posg representation28
