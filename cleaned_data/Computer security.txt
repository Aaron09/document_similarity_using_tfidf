exploitable vulnerability least working attack exploit exists4 vulnerabilities often hunted exploited automated tools manually using customized scripts
secure computer system important understand attacks made threats typically classified categories
backdooredit
backdoor computer system cryptosystem algorithm secret method bypassing normal authentication security controls exist number reasons including original design poor configuration added authorized party allow legitimate access attacker malicious reasons regardless motives existence create vulnerability
denialofservice attackedit
denial service attacks designed make machine network resource unavailable intended users5 attackers deny service individual victims deliberately entering wrong password enough consecutive times cause victims account locked overload capabilities machine network block users network attack single address blocked adding firewall rule many forms distributed denial service ddos attacks possible attack comes large number points defending much difficult attacks originate zombie computers botnet range techniques possible including reflection amplification attacks innocent systems fooled sending traffic victim
directaccess attacksedit
unauthorized user gaining physical access computer likely able directly copy data also compromise security making operating system modifications installing software worms keyloggers covert listening devices using wireless mice6 even system protected standard security measures able bypassed booting another operating system tool cdrom bootable media disk encryption trusted platform module designed prevent attacks

security design alternately secure design means software designed ground secure case security considered main feature
techniques approach include

principle least privilege part system privileges needed function even attacker gains access part limited access whole system
automated theorem proving prove correctness crucial software subsystems
code reviews unit testing approaches make modules secure formal correctness proofs possible
defense depth design subsystem needs violated compromise integrity system information holds
default secure settings design fail secure rather fail insecure failsafe equivalent safety engineering ideally secure system require deliberate conscious knowledgeable free decision part legitimate authorities order make insecure

security measuresedit
state computer security conceptual ideal attained three processes threat prevention detection response processes based various policies system components include following

user account access controls cryptography protect systems files data respectively
firewalls common prevention systems network security perspective properly configured shield access internal network services block certain kinds attacks packet filtering firewalls hardware softwarebased
intrusion detection system products designed detect network attacks inprogress assist postattack forensics audit trails logs serve similar function individual systems
response necessarily defined assessed security requirements individual system cover range simple upgrade protections notification legal authorities counterattacks like special cases complete destruction compromised system favored happen compromised resources detected

today computer security comprises mainly preventive measures like firewalls exit procedure firewall defined filtering network data host network another network internet implemented software running machine hooking network stack case unixbased operating systems linux built operating system kernel provide real time filtering blocking another implementation socalled physical firewall consists separate machine filtering network traffic firewalls common amongst machines permanently connected internet

backups copies kept important computer files typically multiple copies daily weekly monthly kept different location away original secure damage original location security breached attacker destroyed damaged natural disasters
capability access control list techniques used ensure privilege separation mandatory access control section discusses
chain trust techniques used attempt ensure software loaded certified authentic systems designers
confidentiality nondisclosure information except another authorized person202
cryptographic techniques used defend data transit systems reducing probability data exchanged systems intercepted modified
cyberwarfare internetbased conflict involves politically motivated attacks information information systems attacks example disable official websites networks disrupt disable essential services steal alter classified data cripple financial systems
data integrity accuracy consistency stored data indicated absence alteration data updates data record203





cryptographic techniques involve transforming information scrambling becomes unreadable transmission intended recipient unscramble message ideally eavesdroppers cannot



encryption used protect message eyes others cryptographically secure ciphers designed make practical attempt breaking infeasible symmetrickey ciphers suitable bulk encryption using shared keys publickey encryption using digital certificates provide practical solution problem securely communicating shared advance
endpoint security software helps networks prevent exfiltration data theft virus infection network entry points made vulnerable prevalence potentially infected portable computing devices laptops mobile devices external storage devices drives204
firewalls serve gatekeeper system networks allowing traffic matches defined rules often include detailed logging include intrusion detection intrusion prevention features nearuniversal company local area networks internet also used internally impose traffic rules networks network segmentation configured
honey pots computers intentionally left vulnerable attack crackers used catch crackers identify techniques
intrusiondetection systems scan network people network things example trying passwords gain access network
microkernel approach operating system design nearminimum amount code running privileged level runs elements operating system device drivers protocol stacks file systems safer less privileged user space
pinging standard ping application used test address attackers port scan detect services exposed
port scan used probe address open ports hence identify network services running
