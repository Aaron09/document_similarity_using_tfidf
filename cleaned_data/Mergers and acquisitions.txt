great merger movement 1895–1905edit
great merger movement predominantly business phenomenon happened 1895 1905 time small firms little market share consolidated similar firms form large powerful institutions dominated markets estimated 1800 firms disappeared consolidations many acquired substantial shares markets operated vehicle used socalled trusts 1900 value firms acquired mergers 1990 value 1998 2000 around 10–11 companies dupont steel general electric merged great merger movement able keep dominance respective sectors 1929 cases today growing technological advances products patents brand recognition customers also companies held greatest market share 1905 time competitive advantages companies like dupont general electric companies international paper american chicle market share decrease significantly 1929 smaller competitors joined forces provided much competition companies merged mass producers homogeneous goods could exploit efficiencies large volume production addition many mergers capitalintensive high fixed costs demand fell newly merged companies incentive maintain output reduce prices however often mergers quick mergers quick mergers involved mergers companies unrelated technology different management result efficiency gains associated mergers present bigger company would actually face higher costs competitors technological managerial differences thus mergers done large efficiency gains fact done trend time companies specific fine products like fine writing paper earned profits high margin rather volume took part great merger movementcitation needed
shortrun factorsedit
major short factors sparked great merger movement desire keep prices high however high prices attracted entry firms industry
major catalyst behind great merger movement panic 1893 major decline demand many homogeneous goods producers homogeneous goods demand falls producers incentive maintain output prices order spread high fixed costs producers faced lowering cost unit desire exploit efficiencies maximum volume production however panic 1893 fall demand steep fall prices
another economic model proposed naomi lamoreaux explaining steep price falls view involved firms acting monopolies respective markets quasimonopolists firms quantity marginal cost equals marginal revenue price quantity intersects demand panic 1893 demand fell along demand firm’s marginal revenue fell well given high fixed costs price average total cost resulting loss however also high fixed costs industry costs spread greater production higher quantity produced return quasimonopoly model order firm earn profit firms would steal part another firm’s market share dropping price slightly producing point higher quantity lower price exceeded average total cost firms joined practice prices began falling everywhere price ensued39
strategy keep prices high maintain profitability producers good collude form associations also known cartels cartels thus able raise prices right away sometimes doubling prices however prices cartels provided shortterm solution cartel members would cheat setting lower price price cartel also high price cartel would encourage firms enter industry offer competitive pricing causing prices fall result cartels succeed maintaining high prices period years viable solution problem firms merge horizontal integration firms market order control large market share thus successfully higher pricecitation needed
longrun factorsedit
long desire keep costs advantageous firms merge reduce transportation costs thus producing transporting location rather various sites different companies past transport costs coupled economies scale also increased firm size fourfold second half nineteenth century addition technological changes prior merger movement within companies increased efficient size plants capital intensive assembly lines allowing economies scale thus improved technology transportation forerunners great merger movement part competitors mentioned part government however many initially successful mergers eventually dismantled government passed sherman 1890 setting rules price fixing monopolies starting 1890s cases addyston pipe steel company united states courts attacked large companies strategizing others within companies maximize profits price fixing competitors created greater incentive companies unite merge name competitors anymore technically price fixing

emerging countriesedit
practice emerging countries differs mature economies although transaction management valuation tools comparables share common basic methodology china india brazil example differences affect formation asset price structuring deals profitability expectations shorter time horizon terminal value visibility risk represented discount rate must properly adjusted50 perspective differences emerging mature economies include less developed system property rights less reliable financial information cultural differences negotiations higher degree competition best targets

property rights51 capacity transfer property rights legally enforce protection rights payment questionable property transfer stock purchase agreement imperfect real warranties even reversible multiple administrative authorizations needed granted closing leading situations costly remedial actions necessary rule established corruption rampant problem
information52 documentation delivered buyer scarce limited level reliability example double sets accounting common practice blur capacity form correct judgment running valuation basis bears risk lead erroneous conclusions therefore building reliable knowledge base observable facts result focused diligences recurring profitability measured ebitda good starting point
negotiation53 “yes” synonym parties reached agreement getting immediately point considered appropriate cultures even considered rude negotiations continue last minute sometimes even deal officially closed seller keeps leverage like minority stake divested entity therefore establishing strong local business network starting acquisitions usually prerequisite know trustable parties deal allies
competition race acquire best companies emerging economy generate high degree competition inflate transaction prices consequence limited available targets push poor management decisions investment time always needed build reliable information competitive landscape
