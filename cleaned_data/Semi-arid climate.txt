defining attributes semiarid climatesedit
precise definition given köppen climate classification treats steppe climates intermediates desert climates humid climates ecological characteristics agricultural potential semiarid climates tend support short scrubby vegetation usually dominated either grasses shrubs

determine location semiarid climate precipitation threshold must first determined finding precipitation threshold millimeters involves first multiplying average annual temperature adding total precipitation highsun half year april september northern temperate zone october march southern 30–70 total precipitation received applicable period less total precipitation received areas annual precipitation less threshold half threshold classified steppe climate1
furthermore delineate semiarid climates cold semiarid climates three widely used isotherms either mean annual temperature 18°c mean temperature −3°c coldest month location type climate appropriate temperature whichever isotherm used classified semiarid location appropriate temperature given isotherm classified cold semiarid
