coaxial cablesedit
coaxial cables commonly used audio frequencies convenience coaxial cable conductive wire inside conductive tube separated dielectric layer current flowing surface inner conductor equal opposite current flowing inner surface outer tube electromagnetic field thus completely contained within tube ideally energy lost radiation coupling outside tube coaxial cables acceptably small losses frequencies microwave frequencies greater losses mainly electrical resistance central conductor become large making waveguides efficient medium transmitting energy coaxial cables rather solid dielectric preferred transmit power lower loss
waveguidesedit
waveguides similar coaxial cables consist tubes biggest difference waveguide inner conductor waveguides arbitrary cross section rectangular cross sections common waveguides inner conductor carry return current waveguides cannot deliver energy means electric current rather means guided electromagnetic field although surface currents flow inner walls waveguides surface currents carry power power carried guided electromagnetic fields surface currents guided electromagnetic fields effect keeping fields inside waveguide preventing leakage fields space outside waveguide waveguides dimensions comparable wavelength alternating current transmitted feasible microwave frequencies addition mechanical feasibility electrical resistance nonideal metals forming walls waveguide cause dissipation power surface currents flowing lossy conductors dissipate power higher frequencies power lost dissipation becomes unacceptably large
