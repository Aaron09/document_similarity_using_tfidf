word emotion dates back 1579 adapted french word émouvoir means stir term emotion introduced academic discussion catchall term passions sentiments affections12 according dictionary earliest precursors word likely dates back origins language13 modern word emotion heterogeneous14 uses word emotions intense feelings directed someone something15 hand emotion used refer states mild annoyed content states directed anything anxiety depression line research thus looks meaning word emotion everyday language14 usage rather different academic discourse another line research asks languages english interesting finding many languages similar identical term1617
emotions described theorists discrete consistent responses internal external events particular significance organism emotions brief duration consist coordinated responses include verbal physiological behavioral neural mechanisms18 psychotherapist michael graham describes emotions existing continuum intensity19 thus fear might range mild concern terror shame might range simple embarrassment toxic shame20 emotions also described biologically given result evolution provided good solutions ancient recurring problems faced ancestors21 moods feelings tend less intense emotions often lack contextual stimulus15
emotion differentiated number similar constructs within field affective neuroscience18

feelings best understood subjective representation emotions private individual experiencing
moods diffuse affective states generally last much longer durations emotions also usually less intense emotions
affect encompassing term used describe topics emotion feelings moods together even though commonly used interchangeably emotion

addition relationships exist emotions positive negative influences direct opposites existing concepts described contrasting categorization emotions graham differentiates emotions functional dysfunctional argues functional emotions benefits22
componentsedit
scherers components processing model emotion23 five crucial elements emotion said exist component processing perspective emotion experience said require processes become coordinated synchronized short period time driven appraisal processes although inclusion cognitive appraisal elements slightly controversial since theorists make assumption emotion cognition separate interacting systems component processing model provides sequence events effectively describes coordination involved emotional episode

cognitive appraisal provides evaluation events objects
bodily symptoms physiological component emotional experience
action tendencies motivational component preparation direction motor responses
expression facial vocal expression almost always accompanies emotional state communicate reaction intention actions
feelings subjective experience emotional state occurred

classificationedit
main article emotion classification
distinction made emotional episodes emotional dispositions emotional dispositions also comparable character traits someone said generally disposed experience certain emotions example irritable person generally disposed feel irritation easily quickly others finally theorists place emotions within general category affective states affective states also include emotionrelated phenomena pleasure pain motivational states example hunger curiosity moods dispositions traits24

examples basic emotions


years paul ekman supported view emotions discrete measurable physiologically distinct ekmans influential work revolved around finding certain emotions appeared universally recognized even cultures preliterate could learned associations facial expressions media another classic study found participants contorted facial muscles distinct facial expressions example disgust reported subjective physiological experiences matched distinct facial expressions research findings classify emotions basic anger disgust fear happiness sadness surprise25
robert plutchik agreed ekmans biologically driven perspective developed wheel emotions suggesting eight primary emotions grouped positive negative basis versus sadness anger versus fear trust versus disgust surprise versus anticipation25 basic emotions modified form complex emotions complex emotions could arise cultural conditioning association combined basic emotions alternatively similar primary colors combine primary emotions could blend form full spectrum human emotional experience example interpersonal anger disgust could blend form contempt relationships exist basic emotions resulting positive negative influences26

19th century

perspectives emotions evolutionary theory initiated midlate 19th century charles darwins 1872 book expression emotions animals37 darwin argued emotions actually served purpose humans communication also aiding survival darwin therefore argued emotions evolved natural selection therefore universal crosscultural counterparts darwin also detailed virtues experiencing emotions parallel experiences occur animals animal research emotions eventual determination neural underpinnings emotion

contemporary

contemporary views along evolutionary psychology spectrum posit basic emotions social emotions evolved motivate social behaviors adaptive ancestral environment7 current researchcitation needed suggests emotion essential part human decisionmaking planning famous distinction made reason emotion clear seems paul maclean claims emotion competes even instinctive responses hand abstract reasoning hand increased potential neuroimaging also allowed investigation evolutionarily ancient parts brain important neurological advances derived perspectives 1990s joseph ledoux antónio damásio

main article james–lange theory
1884 article43 william james argued feelings emotions secondary physiological phenomena theory james proposed perception called exciting fact directly physiological response known emotion44 account different types emotional experiences james proposed stimuli trigger activity autonomic nervous system turn produces emotional experience brain danish psychologist carl lange also proposed similar theory around time therefore theory became known james–lange theory james wrote perception bodily changes occur emotion james claims feel angry strike afraid tremble either strike tremble sorry angry fearful case be43
example theory action would follows emotionevoking stimulus snake triggers pattern physiological response increased heart rate faster breathing interpreted particular emotion fear theory supported experiments manipulating bodily state induces desired emotional state45 people believe emotions give rise emotionspecific actions example crying away scared issue james–lange theory causation bodily states causing emotions priori bodily influences emotional experience argued still quite prevalent today biofeedback studies embodiment theory46
although mostly abandoned original form dalgleish argues contemporary neuroscientists embraced components jameslange theory emotions47

james–lange theory remained influential main contribution emphasis places embodiment emotions especially argument changes bodily concomitants emotions alter experienced intensity contemporary neuroscientists would endorse modified james–lange view bodily feedback modulates experience emotion

cannon–bard theoryedit
main article cannon–bard theory
walter bradford cannon agreed physiological responses played crucial role emotions believe physiological responses alone could explain subjective emotional experiences argued physiological responses slow often imperceptible could account relatively rapid intense subjective awareness emotion48 also believed richness variety temporal course emotional experiences could stem physiological reactions reflected fairly undifferentiated fight flight responses4950 example theory action follows emotionevoking event snake triggers simultaneously physiological response conscious experience emotion
phillip bard contributed theory work animals bard found sensory motor physiological information pass diencephalon particularly thalamus subjected processing therefore cannon also argued anatomically possible sensory events trigger physiological response prior triggering conscious awareness emotional stimuli trigger physiological experiential aspects emotion simultaneously49

cognitive theoriesedit
twofactor theory incorporating cognition several theories began argue cognitive activity form judgments evaluations thoughts entirely necessary emotion occur main proponents view richard lazarus argued emotions must cognitive intentionality cognitive activity involved interpretation emotional context conscious unconscious take form conceptual processing
lazarus theory influential emotion disturbance occurs following order

cognitive appraisal—the individual assesses event cognitively cues emotion
physiological changes—the cognitive reaction starts biological changes increased heart rate pituitary adrenal response
action—the individual feels emotion chooses react

example jenny sees snake

jenny cognitively assesses snake presence cognition allows understand danger
brain activates adrenaline gland pumps adrenaline blood stream resulting increased heartbeat
jenny screams runs away

lazarus stressed quality intensity emotions controlled cognitive processes processes underline coping strategies form emotional reaction altering relationship person environment
george mandler provided extensive theoretical empirical discussion emotion influenced cognition consciousness autonomic nervous system books mind emotion 1975 mind body psychology emotion stress 1984
theories emotions arguing cognitive activity form judgments evaluations thoughts necessary order emotion occur prominent philosophical exponent robert solomon example passions emotions meaning life 1993 solomon claims emotions judgments forward nuanced view response called ‘standard objection’ cognitivism idea judgment something fearsome occur without emotion judgment cannot identified emotion theory proposed nico frijda appraisal leads action tendencies another example
also suggested emotions affect heuristics feelings gutfeeling reactions often used shortcuts process information influence behavior52 affect infusion model theoretical model developed joseph forgas early 1990s attempts explain emotion mood interact ones ability process information
