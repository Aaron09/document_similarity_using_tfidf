historyedit
historically voice data communications based methods circuit switching exemplified traditional telephone network wherein telephone call allocated dedicated electronic connection communicating stations stations might telephones computers temporarily dedicated line typically comprises many intermediary lines assembled chain reaches originating station destination station packet switching network could share single communication link communication multiple pairs receivers transmitters
earliest ideas computer network intended allow general communications among computer users formulated computer scientist licklider bolt beranek newman april 1963 memoranda discussing concept intergalactic computer network ideas encompassed many features contemporary internet october 1963 licklider appointed head behavioral sciences command control programs defense departments advanced research projects agency arpa convinced ivan sutherland taylor network concept important merited development although licklider left arpa contracts assigned development7

brief history internet internet society denies arpanet designed survive nuclear attack

rand study false rumor started claiming arpanet somehow related building network resistant nuclear never true arpanet aspect earlier rand study secure communication later work internetworking emphasize robustness survivability including capability withstand losses large portions underlying networks34

rand study conducted paul baran first build theoretical model communication using packet switching10 interview confirmed arpanet exactly share projects goal work greatly contributed development arpanet35 minutes taken elmer shapiro stanford research institute arpanet design meeting 9–10 1967 indicate version barans routing method suggestion using fixed packet size expected employed36
according stephen lukasik deputy director director darpa 1967–1974 person signed checks arpanets development

goal exploit computer technologies meet needs military command control nuclear threats achieve survivable control nuclear forces improve military tactical management decision making37

arpanet incorporated distributed computation frequent recomputation routing tables increased survivability network face significant interruption automatic routing technically challenging time arpanet designed survive subordinatenetwork losses since principal reason switching nodes network links unreliable even without nuclear attacks resource scarcity supported creation arpanet according charles herzfeld arpa director 1965–1967

arpanet started create command control system would survive nuclear attack many claim build system clearly major military need arpas mission fact would severely criticized tried rather arpanet came frustration limited number large powerful research computers country many research investigators access geographically separated them38

historical document first arpanet first message ever sent arpanet 1030 october 1969 excerpt kept ucla describes setting message transmission ucla sigma host computer host computer


initial arpanet consisted four imps41

university california angeles ucla leonard kleinrock established network measurement center sigma first computer attached
augmentation research center stanford research institute international douglas engelbart created groundbreaking system important early hypertext system would network information center named genie first host attached
university california santa barbara ucsb cullerfried interactive mathematics centers 36075 running osmvt machine attached
university utah school computing ivan sutherland moved running pdp10 operating tenex

first successful message arpanet sent ucla student programmer charley kline 1030 october 1969 boelter hall 342042 kline transmitted universitys sigma host computer stanford research institutes host computer message text word login earlier attempt letters transmitted system crashed hence literal first message arpanet hour later programmers repaired code caused crash sigma computer effected full login first permanent arpanet link established november 1969 ucla stanford research institute december 1969 entire fournode network established43
growth evolutionedit
march 1970 arpanet reached east coast united states cambridge massachusetts connected network thereafter arpanet grew imps june 1970 imps december 1970 september 1971 network included university government hosts imps august 1972 september 1973 june 1974 imps july 1975 network numbered imps 1981 number host computers another host connecting approximately every twenty days41
1973 transatlantic satellite link connected norwegian seismic array norsar arpanet making norway first country outside connected network time terrestrial circuit added london imp44
1975 arpanet declared operational defense communications agency took control since arpa intended fund advanced research41
september 1984 work completed restructuring arpanet giving military sites military network milnet unclassified defense department communications4546 controlled gateways connected networks combination called defense data network ddn47 separating civil military networks reduced 113node arpanet nodes milnet later became niprnet
rules etiquetteedit
government funding certain forms traffic discouraged prohibited 1982 handbook computing mits stated regarding network etiquette48

considered illegal arpanet anything direct support government business personal messages arpanet subscribers example arrange gettogether check friendly hello generally considered harmful sending electronic mail arpanet commercial profit political purposes antisocial illegal sending messages offend many people possible serious trouble government agencies manage arpanet

technologyedit

software protocolsedit
starting point hosttohost communication arpanet 1969 1822 protocol defined transmission messages imp58 message format designed work unambiguously broad range computer architectures 1822 message essentially consisted message type numeric host address data field send data message another host transmitting host formatted data message containing destination hosts address data message sent transmitted message 1822 hardware interface delivered message destination address either delivering locally connected host delivering another message ultimately delivered destination host receiving would transmit ready next message rfnm acknowledgement sending host
unlike modern internet datagrams arpanet designed reliably transmit 1822 messages inform host computer loses message contemporary unreliable whereas reliable nonetheless 1822 protocol proved inadequate handling multiple connections among different applications residing host computer problem addressed network control program provided standard method establish reliable flowcontrolled bidirectional communications links among different processes different host computers interface allowed application software connect across arpanet implementing higherlevel communication protocols early example protocol layering concept incorporated model50
1983 tcpip protocols replaced arpanets principal protocol arpanet became component early internet51
network applicationsedit
provided standard network services could shared several applications running single host computer evolution application protocols operated less independently underlying network service permitted independent advances underlying protocols
1971 tomlinson sent first network email 56159 1973 email constituted percent arpanet traffic
1973 file transfer protocol specification defined implemented enabling file transfers arpanet
network voice protocol specifications defined 1977 implemented technical shortcomings conference calls arpanet never worked well contemporary voice internet protocol packet voice decades away
