metric system internationally agreed decimal system measurement originally based mètre archives kilogramme archives introduced french first republic 17991 years definitions metre kilogram refined metric system extended incorporate many units although number variants metric system emerged late nineteenth early twentieth centuries term often used synonym sinote international system units—the official system measurement almost every country world
metric system officially sanctioned united states since 18662 remains industrialised country fully adopted metric system official system measurement although 1988 united states congress passed omnibus foreign trade competitiveness designates metric system measurement preferred system weights measures trade commerce among many things requires federal agencies metric measurements nearly activities although still exceptions allowing traditional linear units used documents intended consumers many sources also cite countries liberia myanmar burma countries done although united kingdom also uses metric system administrative trade purposes imperial units widely used public permitted obligatory purposes road signs
although originators intended devise system equally accessible proved necessary prototype units custody national local authorities standards control prototype units measure maintained later french governments 1875 passed international intergovernmental organisation general conference weights measures cgpmnote
