figure energy momentum light different inertial frames


light particles photons travel speed constant conventionally known speed light statement tautology since many modern formulations relativity start constant speed light postulate photons therefore propagate along lightlike world line appropriate units equal space time components every observer
consequence maxwells theory electromagnetism light carries energy momentum ratio constant rearranging since photons space time components equal must therefore equated time component spacetime momentum vector
photons travel speed light finite momentum energy mass term must zero meaning photons massless particles infinity times zero illdefined quantity welldefined
analysis energy photon equals rest frame equals moving frame result derived inspection application lorentz transformations consistent analysis doppler effect given previously2888
