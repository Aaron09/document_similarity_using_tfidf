medieval latin enlarged vocabulary freely borrowed sources heavily influenced language vulgate contained many peculiarities alien classical latin resulted less direct translation greek hebrew peculiarities mirrored original vocabulary also grammar syntax greek provided much technical vocabulary christianity various germanic languages spoken germanic tribes invaded southern europe also major sources words germanic leaders became rulers parts roman empire conquered words languages freely imported vocabulary ordinary words replaced coinages vulgar latin germanic sources classical words fallen disuse




illuminated manuscript book hours contains prayers medieval latin


latin also spread areas ireland germany romance languages spoken never known roman rule works written lands latin learned language relation local vernacular also influenced vocabulary syntax medieval latin
since subjects like science philosophy including argumentation theory ethics prelaw communicated latin latin vocabulary developed source great many technical words modern languages english words like abstract subject communicate matter probable cognates european languages generally meanings given medieval latin2
vulgar latinedit
influence vulgar latin also apparent syntax medieval latin writers although classical latin continued held high esteem studied models literary compositions high point development medieval latin literary language came carolingian renaissance rebirth learning kindled patronage charlemagne king franks alcuin charlemagnes latin secretary important writer right influence rebirth latin literature learning depressed period following final disintegration authority western roman empire
although simultaneously developing romance languages latin remained conservative longer native language many ancient medieval grammar books give standard form hand strictly speaking single form medieval latin every latin author medieval period spoke latin second language varying degrees fluency syntax grammar vocabulary often influenced authors native language especially true beginning around 12th century language became increasingly adulterated late medieval latin documents written french speakers tend show similarities medieval french grammar vocabulary written germans tend show similarities german instance rather following classical latin practice generally placing verb medieval writers would often follow conventions native language instead whereas latin definite indefinite articles medieval writers sometimes used forms unus indefinite article forms ille reflecting usage romance languages definite article even quidam meaning certain onething classical latin something like article unlike classical latin esse auxiliary verb medieval latin writers might habere auxiliary similar constructions germanic romance languages accusative infinitive construction classical latin often replaced subordinate clause introduced quod quia almost identical example similar constructions french
every late century onwards learned writers especially within church familiar enough classical syntax aware forms usages wrong resisted thus latin theologian like thomas aquinas erudite clerical historian william tyre tends avoid characteristics described showing period vocabulary spelling alone features listed much prominent language lawyers 11th century english domesday book physicians technical writers secular chroniclers however quod introduce subordinate clauses especially pervasive found levels
changes vocabulary syntax grammaredit
medieval latin ceased living language instead scholarly language minority educated medieval europe used official documents everyday communication resulted major features medieval latin compared classical latin first many authors attempted show knowledge classical latin using rare archaic constructions sometimes anachronistically haphazardly mixing constructions republican imperial latin reality existed centuries apart second many lesser scholars limited grasp proper latin increasingly influenced vulgar latin mutating romance languages

word order usually tended towards vernacular language author artificial polished word order classical latin conversely erudite scholar might attempt show intentionally constructing complicated sentence latin inflected language technically possible place related words opposite ends paragraphlong sentence owing complexity seen sign great skill
typically prepositions used much frequently modern romance languages greater clarity instead using ablative case alone classical latin subject verb often left implied unless stressed videt sees clarity medieval latin frequently includes explicit subject videt sees without necessarily stressing subject
various changes occurred vocabulary certain words mixed different declensions conjugations many compound verbs formed words retained original structure drastically changed meaning animositas specifically means wrath medieval latin classical latin generally referred high spirits excited spirits kind
owing heavy biblical terms large influx words borrowed greek hebrew even grammatical influences obviously largely occurred among priests scholars laity general difficult express abstract concepts latin many scholars admitted example platos abstract concept truth expressed latin always true medieval scholars theologians translating bible greek philosophers latin koine classical greek cobbled together many abstract concept words latin

syntaxedit

indirect discourse classical latin achieved using subject accusative infinitive often simply replaced conjunctions serving function english quod quia quoniam high level overlap constructions even within authors work often matter preference particularly famous often cited example venerable bede using constructions within sentence dico scire quod ignobilis know accusative infinitive unknown construction resulting subordinate clause often used subjunctive mood instead indicative syntax indirect discourse among prominent features medieval latin largest syntactical change
several substitutions often used instead subjunctive clause constructions break rules classical latin alternative express meaning avoiding subjunctive clause

present participle frequently used adverbially place clauses clauses time cause concession purpose loosely similar present participle ablative absolute phrase participle need ablative case
habeo debeo must would used express obligation often gerundive

given obligation inherently carries sense futurity carthage must destroyed point future anticipates romance languages french would habeo basis future tenses abandoning latin forms future tense latin amare habeo indirect discourse love french equivalentaimerai habeo ayyo aimerai become future tense love losing sense obligation medieval latin however still indirect discourse used simply future tense


instead clause introduced infinitive often used verb hoping fearing promising


conversely authors might haphazardly switch subjunctive indicative forms verbs intended difference meaning
usage changed significantly frequently omitted implied many medieval authors feel made sense perfect passive construction laudatus present tense esse past tense construction began using past perfect interchangeably
chaos usage demonstrative pronouns ille iste even intensive ipse often used virtually interchangeably anticipation romance languages ille also frequently used simply express definite article classical latin possess unus also used indirect article
reflexives became much looser reflexive pronoun subordinate clause might refer subject main clause reflexive possessive suus might used place possessive genitive eius
comparison adjectives changed somewhat comparative form sometimes used positive superlative meaning also adverb magis often used positive adjective indicate comparative meaningand multum nimis could used positive form adjective give superlative meaning
classical latin used ablative absolute stated medieval latin examples nominative absolute accusative absolute found point difference ecclesiastical latin clergy vulgar latin laity existed alongside educated clergy mostly knew traditional latin nominative accusative case constructions ablative case constructions observed medieval changes developed among uneducated commoners
classical latin distinguish progressive action present tense thus laudo mean either praise praising imitation greek medieval latin could present participle form periphrastic tense equivalent english progressive greek periphrastic tense formation could also done past future tenses laudans praising laudans eram praising laudans praising
classical latin verbs voices active passive greek original language testament additional middle voice reflexive voice express subject acting upon achilles armor onto jesus clothed robe would middle voice latin middle voice medieval latin expresses sentences putting verb passive voice form conceptual meaning active similar latin deponent verbs example medieval latin translation genesis states literally moved waters spiritus ferebatur super aquas genesis expressing greek middlevoice verb moved waters
overlapping orthography differences certain diphthongs sometimes shortened thus oecumenicus becomes familiar ecumenicus familiar later form religious terms ecumenical common medieval latin diphthong particularly frequent latin shift affects many common words caelum heaven shortened celum even puellae girls shortened puelle

orthographyedit




prüfening dedicatory inscription 1119 composed medieval latin


many striking differences classical medieval latin found orthography perhaps striking difference medieval manuscripts used wide range abbreviations means superscripts special characters instance letters often omitted replaced diacritical mark preceding following letter apart frequently occurring differences follows clearly many would influenced spelling indeed pronunciation vernacular language thus varied different european countries

following carolingian reforms century carolingian minuscule widely adopted leading clear differentiation capital lowercase letters
partial full differentiation
diphthong usually collapsed simply written caudata example puellae might written puelle puellę happens diphthong example pena edipus poena oedipus feature already found coin inscriptions century reipublice reipublicae conversely original classical latin often represented aecclesia coena also reflected english spellings foetus
severe decline knowledge greek loanwords foreign names transmitted greek might used less interchangeably ysidorus egiptus isidorus aegyptus also found pure latin words ocius swiftly appears ocyus silva sylva last form survived 18th century became embedded modern botanical latin also pennsylvania
might lost habere becomes abere mihi becomes latter also occurred classical latin mihi written michi indicating come pronounced perhaps pronunciation found classical latin
loss pronunciation also addition writing previously belong especially vicinity chorona corona tendency also sometimes seen classical latin
vowel often written divitiae becomes diviciae divicie tertius becomes tercius vitium vicium
combination might another plosive inserted alumnus becomes alumpnus somnus sompnus
single consonants often doubled vice versa tranquillitas becomes tranquilitas africa becomes affrica
syncopation became frequent especially verbs perfect tense might lost novisse becomes nosse occurred classical latin well much frequent medieval latin

orthographical differences often changes pronunciation previous example morphology authors reflected writing 16th century erasmus complained speakers different countries unable understand others form latin3
gradual changes latin escape notice contemporaries petrarch writing 14th century complained linguistic decline helped fuel general dissatisfaction
