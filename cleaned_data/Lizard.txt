distinguishing features




skin lacerta agilis showing overlapping scales made keratin


lizards typically four legs feet external ears though legless snakes lack characteristics lizards snakes share movable quadrate bone distinguishing sphenodonts primitive solid diapsid skulls lizards chameleons prehensile tails assisting climbing among vegetation4
reptiles skin lizards covered overlapping scales made keratin provides protection environment reduces water loss evaporation adaptation enables lizards thrive driest deserts earth skin tough leathery shed sloughed animal grows unlike snakes shed skin single piece lizards slough skin several pieces scales modified spines display protection species bone osteoderms underneath scales45




tegu tupinambis rufescens skull showing teeth differing types


dentitions lizards reflect wide range diets including carnivorous insectivorous omnivorous herbivorous nectivorous molluscivorous species typically uniform teeth suited diet several species variable teeth cutting teeth front jaws crushing teeth rear species pleurodont though agamids chameleons acrodont64
tongue extended outside mouth often long beaded lizards whiptails monitor lizards tongue forked used mainly exclusively sense environment continually flicking sample environment back transfer molecules vomeronasal organ responsible chemosensation analogous different smell taste geckos tongue used lick eyes clean eyelids chameleons long sticky tongues extended rapidly catch insect prey4
three lineages geckos anoles chameleons modified scales toes form adhesive pads highly prominent first groups pads composed millions tiny setae closely substrate adhere using molecules forces liquid adhesive needed7 addition toes chameleons divided opposed groups foot zygodactyly enabling perch branches birds doa4
physiology
locomotion




adhesive pads enable geckos climb vertically


aside legless lizards lizards quadrupedal move using gaits alternating movement right left limbs substantial body bending body bending prevents significant respiration movement limiting endurance mechanism called carriers constraint several species bipedally8 prop hindlimbs tail stationary several small species genus draco glide attain distance metres feet losing metres feet height9 species like geckos chameleons adhere vertical surfaces including glass ceilings7 species like common basilisk across water10
senses
information sense
lizards make senses sight touch olfaction hearing like vertebrates balance varies habitat different species instance skinks live largely covered loose soil rely heavily olfaction touch geckos depend largely acute vision ability hunt evaluate distance prey striking monitor lizards acute vision hearing olfactory senses lizards make unusual sense organs chameleons steer eyes different directions sometimes providing nonoverlapping fields view forwards backwards lizards lack external ears instead circular opening tympanic membrane eardrum seen many species rely hearing early warning predators flee slightest sound11




nile monitor using tongue smell


snakes many mammals lizards specialised olfactory system vomeronasal organ used detect pheromones monitor lizards transfer scent tongue organ tongue used informationgathering purpose involved manipulating food1211
lizards particularly iguanas retained photosensory organ heads called parietal basal primitive feature also present tuatara rudimentary retina lens cannot form images sensitive changes light dark detect movement helps detect predators stalking above13
venom




lizards including gila monster venomous


information evolution snake venom
2006 thought among lizards gila monster mexican beaded lizard venomous however several species monitor lizards including komodo dragon produce powerful venom oral glands lace monitor venom instance causes swift loss consciousness extensive bleeding pharmacological effects lowering blood pressure preventing blood clotting nine classes toxin known snakes produced lizards range actions provides potential medicinal drugs based lizard venom proteins1415
genes associated venom toxins found salivary glands wide range lizards including species traditionally thought nonvenomous iguanas bearded dragons suggests genes evolved common ancestor lizards snakes million years forming single clade toxicofera14 however putative venom genes housekeeping genes found cells tissues including skin cloacal scent glands genes question thus evolutionary precursors venom genes16
respiration
recent studies 2013 2014 lung anatomy savannah monitor green iguana found unidirectional airflow system involves moving loop lungs breathing previously thought exist archosaurs crocodilians birds evidence unidirectional airflow ancestral trait diapsids1718
reproduction lifecycle




trachylepis maculilabris skinks mating


tetrapods lizards rely internal fertilisation copulation involves male inserting hemipenes females cloaca19 majority species oviparous laying female deposits eggs protective structure like nest crevice simply ground20 depending species clutch size vary percent females body weight 40–50 percent clutches range large eggs dozens small ones21

behaviour
diurnality thermoregulation
majority lizard species active day25 though active night notably geckos ectotherms lizards limited ability regulate body temperature must seek bask sunlight gain enough heat become fully active26
territoriality




fighting male sand lizards


social interactions among lizards breeding individuals25 territoriality common correlated species sitandwait hunting strategies males establish maintain territories contain resources attract females defend males important resources include basking feeding nesting sites well refuges predators habitat species affects structure territories example rock lizards territories atop rocky outcrops27 species aggregate groups enhancing vigilance lessening risk predation individuals particularly juveniles28 agonistic behaviour typically occurs sexually mature males territory mates involve displays posturing chasing grappling biting27
