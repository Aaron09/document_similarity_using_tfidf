sensory memoryedit
main article sensory memory
sensory memory holds sensory information less second item perceived ability look item remember looked like split second observation memorization example sensory memory cognitive control automatic response short presentations participants often report seem actually report first experiments exploring form sensory memory precisely conducted george sperling 19632 using partial report paradigm subjects presented grid letters arranged three rows four brief presentation subjects played either high medium tone cuing rows report based partial report experiments sperling able show capacity sensory memory approximately items degraded quickly within hundred milliseconds form memory degrades quickly participants would display unable report items whole report procedure decayed type memory cannot prolonged rehearsal
three types sensory memories exist iconic memory fast decaying store visual information type sensory memory briefly stores image perceived small duration echoic memory fast decaying store auditory information another type sensory memory briefly stores sounds perceived short durations3 haptic memory type sensory memory represents database touch stimuli
shortterm memoryedit
main article shortterm memory
shortterm memory also known working memory shortterm memory allows recall period several seconds minute without rehearsal capacity also limited george miller 1956 working bell laboratories conducted experiments showing store shortterm memory items title famous paper magical number modern estimates capacity shortterm memory lower typically order items4 however memory capacity increased process called chunking5 example recalling tendigit telephone number person could chunk digits three groups first area code threedigit chunk lastly fourdigit chunk 7890 method remembering telephone numbers effective attempting remember string digits able chunk information meaningful groups numbers reflected countries tendency display telephone numbers several chunks four numbers
shortterm memory believed rely mostly acoustic code storing information lesser extent visual code conrad 19646 found test subjects difficulty recalling collections letters acoustically similar confusion recalling acoustically similar letters rather visually similar letters implies letters encoded acoustically conrads 1964 study however deals encoding written text thus memory written language rely acoustic components generalisations forms memory cannot made

working memory model


1974 baddeley hitch proposed working memory model replaced general concept shortterm memory active maintenance information shortterm storage model working memory consists three basic stores central executive phonological loop visuospatial sketchpad 2000 model expanded multimodal episodic buffer baddeleys model working memory13
central executive essentially acts attention sensory store channels information three component processes phonological loop visuospatial sketchpad episodic buffer
phonological loop stores auditory information silently rehearsing sounds words continuous loop articulatory process example repetition telephone number short list data easier remember
visuospatial sketchpad stores visual spatial information engaged performing spatial tasks judging distances visual ones counting windows house imagining images
episodic buffer dedicated linking information across domains form integrated units visual spatial verbal information chronological ordering memory story movie scene episodic buffer also assumed links longterm memory semantical meaning
working memory model explains many practical observations easier different tasks verbal visual similar tasks visual aforementioned wordlength effect however concept central executive noted criticised inadequate vaguecitation needed working memory also premise allows everyday activities involving thought section memory carry thought processes learn reason topics13
