since antiquity arcminute arcsecond used astronomy ecliptic coordinate system latitude longitude horizon system altitude azimuth equatorial coordinate system declination measured degrees arcminutes arcseconds principal exception right ascension equatorial coordinates measured time units hours minutes seconds
arcsecond also often used describe small astronomical angles angular diameters planets angular diameter venus varies proper motion stars separation components binary star systems parallax small change position star course year solar system body earth rotates small angles also written milliarcseconds thousandths arcsecond unit distance parsec named parallax arcsecond developed parallax measurements distance mean radius earths orbit would subtend angle arcsecond

cartographyedit
minutes seconds also used cartography navigation level minute along equator meridian indeed great circle equals exactly geographical mile along earths equator approximately nautical mile 1852 meters ≈115078 statute miles9 second sixtieth amount roughly meters feet exact distance varies along meridian arcs figure earth slightly oblate bulges third percent equator
positions traditionally given using degrees minutes seconds arcs latitude north south equator longitude east west prime meridian position earths reference ellipsoid precisely given method however inconvenient base60 minutes seconds positions frequently expressed decimal fractional degrees equal amount precision degrees given three decimal places 17003100000000000000♠1000 degree precision degreesminutesseconds 17003360000000000000♠3600 degree specify locations within meters feet
property cadastral surveyingedit
related cartography property boundary surveying using metes bounds system relies fractions degree describe property lines angles reference cardinal directions boundary mete described beginning reference point cardinal direction north south followed angle less degrees second cardinal direction linear distance boundary runs specified linear distance beginning point direction distance determined rotating first cardinal direction specified angle toward second cardinal direction example north west 8569 feet would describe line running starting point 8569 feet direction 65655° away north toward west

arcminute commonly found firearms industry literature particularly concerning accuracy rifles though industry refers minute angle especially popular shooters familiar imperial measurement system subtended sphere diameter 1047 inches yards 2908 traditional distance target ranges subtension linear distance example yards subtended sphere diameter 5235 inches 1000 yards subtended sphere diameter 1047 inches since many modern telescopic sights adjustable half quarter eighth increments also known clicks zeroing adjustments made counting clicks respectively
example point impact inches high inches left point yards instance could measured using spotting scope calibrated reticle scope needs adjusted right adjustments trivial scopes adjustment dials scale printed even figuring right number clicks relatively easy scopes click fractions makes zeroing adjustments much easier

adjust ​1⁄2 scope right scope needs adjusted clicks clicks right
adjust ​1⁄4 scope right scope needs adjusted clicks clicks right
adjust ​1⁄8 scope right scope needs adjusted clicks clicks right

another common system measurement firearm scopes milliradian zeroing based scope easy users familiar base systems common adjustment value based scopes approximates ​1⁄3

adjust scope right scope needs adjusted clicks clicks right equals approximately respectively

thing aware scopes including higherend modelscitation needed calibrated adjustment scope knobs corresponds exactly inch impact adjustment target yards rather mathematically correct 1047 commonly known shooters smoa inches hundred yards iphy difference true smoa less half inch even 1000 yards10 error compounds significantly longer range shots require adjustment upwards 2030 compensate bullet drop shot requires adjustment difference true smoa inch competitive target shooting might mean difference miss
physical group size equivalent minutes calculated follows group size tanm60 distance example previously given minute substituting 3600 inches yards 3600 tan160 1047 inches metric units meters 2908 centimeters
sometimes precision firearms accuracy measured simply means ideal conditions wind matchgrade ammo clean barrel vise benchrest used eliminate shooter error capable producing group shots whose center points centertocenter circle average diameter circles several groups subtended amount example rifle capable ideal conditions shooting average 1inch groups yards higherend rifles warrantied manufacturer shoot given threshold typically better specific ammunition error shooters part example remingtons sniper weapon system required shoot better rejected
rifle manufacturers magazines often refer capability submoa meaning shoots means single group shots yards average several groups measure less furthest shots group shots fall within larger samples taken shots group group size typically increases however ultimately average rifle truly rifle would likely consecutive shots land exactly land apart shot groups based confidence rifle normally shoots expected shoot groups although majority groups means practice rifle shoots 1inch groups average yards shoots group measuring inches followed group inches statistically abnormal1112
metric system counterpart milliradian equal 1000th target range laid circle observer centre target range radius number mils full circle therefore always equal 1000 regardless target range therefore 02908 means object spans reticle range meters equal objects size millimeters object mrad meters away conversion factor required contrary system reticle markings hashes dots spaced apart fraction collectively called reticle markings round called mildots
table conversions metric values exact equals exactly meters conversions minutes metric imperial values approximate
