modeling global productionedit
main article hubbert peak theory
idea rate production would peak irreversibly decline 1919 david white chief geologist united states geological survey wrote petroleum peak production soon passed possibly within years13 1953 eugene ayers researcher gulf projected ultimate recoverable reserves billion barrels production would peak later 1960 ultimate recoverable high billion barrels warned wishful thinking peak production would come later 1970 likewise world projected peak somewhere 1985 trillion barrels ultimate recoverable 2000 trillion barrels recoverable ayers made projections without mathematical model wrote curve made look reasonable quite possible adapt mathematical expressions determine peak dates corresponding various ultimate recoverable reserve numbers14
observing past discoveries production levels predicting future discovery trends geoscientist king hubbert used statistical modelling 1956 accurately15 predict united states production would peak 1965 197116 hubbert used semilogistical curved model sometimes incorrectly compared normal distribution assumed production rate limited resource would follow roughly symmetrical distribution depending limits exploitability market pressures rise decline resource production time might sharper stable appear linear curved17 model variants called hubbert peak theory used describe predict peak decline production regions countries multinational areas17 theory also applied limitedresource production
recently term peak popularized colin campbell kjell aleklett 2002 helped form association study peak aspo18 publications hubbert used term peak production rate peak rate discoveries16
2006 analysis hubbert theory noted uncertainty real world production amounts confusion definitions increases uncertainty general production predictions comparing various models found hubberts methods yielded closest none models accurate17 1956 hubbert recommended using family possible production curves predicting production peak decline curve16
comprehensive 2009 study depletion energy research centre noted

“few analysts adhere symmetrical bellshaped production curve correct natural physical reason production resource follow curve little empirical evidence does”

report noted hubbert used logistic curve mathematically convenient firmly believed correct study observed cases asymmetric exponential model provided better peaks tended occur well half produced result nearly cases postpeak decline gradual increase leading peak20
