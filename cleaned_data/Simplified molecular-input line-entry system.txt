historyedit
original smiles specification initiated david weininger usepa midcontinent ecology division laboratory duluth 1980s1234 acknowledged parts early development gilman veith rose russo usepa albert corwin hansch pomona college supporting work arthur weininger pomona daylight jeremy scofield cedar river software renton assistance programming system5 environmental protection agency funded initial project develop smiles67
since modified extended others notably daylight chemical information systems 2007 open standard called opensmiles developed blue obelisk opensource chemistry community linear notations include wiswesser line notation rosdal tripos
july 2006 iupac introduced inchi standard formula representation smiles generally considered advantage slightly humanreadable inchi also wide base software support extensive theoretical graph theory backing
terminologyedit
term smiles refers line notation encoding molecular structures specific instances strictly called smiles strings however term smiles also commonly used refer single smiles string number smiles strings exact meaning usually apparent context terms canonical isomeric lead confusion applied smiles terms describe different attributes smiles strings mutually exclusive
typically number equally valid smiles strings written molecule example specify structure ethanol algorithms developed generate smiles string given molecule many possible strings algorithms choose smiles unique structure although dependent canonicalization algorithm used generate termed canonical smiles algorithms first convert smiles internal representation molecular structure algorithm examines structure produces unique smiles string various algorithms generating canonical smiles developed include daylight chemical information systems openeye scientific software medit chemical computing group molsoft chemistry development common application canonical smiles indexing ensuring uniqueness molecules database
original paper described cangen2 algorithm claimed generate unique smiles strings graphs representing molecules algorithm fails number simple cases cuneane 12dicyclopropylethane cannot considered correct method representing graph canonically8 currently systematic comparison across commercial software test flaws exist packages
smiles notation allows specification configuration tetrahedral centers double bond geometry structural features cannot specified connectivity alone smiles encode information termed isomeric smiles notable feature rules allow rigorous partial specification chirality term isomeric smiles also applied smiles isotopes specified

descriptionedit
atomsedit
atoms represented standard abbreviation chemical elements square brackets gold brackets omitted common case atoms

organic subset
formal charge
number hydrogens attached implied smiles valence model typically normal valence
normal isotopes
chiral centers

elements must enclosed brackets charges hydrogens shown explicitly instance smiles water written either hydrogen also written separate atom water also written
brackets used symbol added atom brackets bonded hydrogen followed number hydrogen atoms greater sign positive charge negative charge example ammonium charge normally written digit however also possible repeat sign many times charges write either titanium thus hydroxide anion represented hydronium cation cobalt cation either
bondsedit
bond represented using symbols
bonds aliphatic atoms assumed single unless specified otherwise implied adjacency smiles string although single bonds written usually omitted example smiles ethanol written usually written
double triple quadruple bonds represented symbols respectively illustrated smiles carbon dioxide hydrogen cyanide gaas gallium arsenide
additional type bond nonbond indicated indicate parts bonded together example aqueous sodium chloride written nacl show dissociation
aromatic half bond indicated aromaticity
single bonds adjacent double bonds represented using indicate stereochemical configuration stereochemistry
ringsedit
ring structures written breaking ring arbitrary point although choices lead legible smiles others make acyclic structure adding numerical ring closure labels show connectivity nonadjacent atoms
example cyclohexane dioxane written c1ccccc1 o1ccocc1 respectively second ring label example decalin decahydronaphthalene written c1cccc2c1cccc2
smiles require ring numbers used particular order permits ring number zero although rarely used also permitted reuse ring numbers first ring closed although usually makes formulae harder read example bicyclohexyl usually written c1ccccc1c2ccccc2 also written c0ccccc0c0ccccc0
multiple digits single atom indicate multiple ringclosing bonds example alternative smiles notation decalin c1cccc2ccccc12 final carbon participates ringclosing bonds twodigit ring numbers required label preceded single ringclosing bond ring
ringclosing digits preceded bond type example cyclopropene usually written c1cc1 double bond chosen ringclosing bond written c1cc1 c1cc1 c1cc1 first form preferred c1cc1 illegal explicitly specifies conflicting types ringclosing bond
ringclosing bonds used denote multiple bonds example c1c1 valid alternative ethylene however used nonbonds c1c2c12 peculiar legal alternative write propane commonly written
choosing ringbreak point adjacent attached groups lead simpler smiles form avoiding branches example cyclohexane12diol simply written oc1ccccc1o choosing different ringbreak location produces branched structure requires parentheses write
aromaticityedit
aromatic rings benzene written three forms

kekul√© form alternating single double bonds c1ccccc1
using aromatic bond symbol c1ccccc1
commonly writing constituent atoms lowercase forms respectively

latter case bonds aromatic atoms assumed explicitly shown aromatic bonds thus benzene pyridine furan represented respectively smiles c1ccccc1 n1ccccc1 o1cccc1
aromatic nitrogen bonded hydrogen found pyrrole must represented imidazole written smiles notation n1cnhcc1
aromatic atoms singly bonded biphenyl single bond must shown explicitly c1ccccc1c2ccccc2 cases single bond symbol required fact smiles software correctly infer bond rings cannot aromatic accept form c1ccccc1c2ccccc2
daylight openeye algorithms generating canonical smiles differ treatment aromaticity

branchingedit
branches described parentheses cccoo propionic acid fcff fluoroform first atom within parentheses first atom parenthesized group bonded branch point atom
substituted rings written branching point ring illustrated smiles cocc1cccc1cn depiction coccc1ccc1cn depiction encode 4cyanoanisole isomers writing smiles substituted rings make humanreadable
branches written order example bromochlorodifluoromethane written fcbrclf brcffcl cfclfbr like generally smiles form easiest read simpler branch comes first final unparenthesized portion complex caveats rearrangements

ring numbers reused paired according order appearance smiles string adjustments required preserve correct pairing
stereochemistry specified adjustments must made stereochemistry notes

form branch require parentheses ringclosing bonds choosing ringclosing bonds appropriately reduce number parentheses required example toluene normally written cc1ccccc1 c1ccccc1c avoiding parentheses required written c1ccccccc1 c1cccccc1c
stereochemistryedit




trans12difluoroethylene


smiles permits require specification stereoisomers
configuration around double bonds specified using characters show directional single bonds adjacent double bond example fccf depiction representation trans12difluoroethylene fluorine atoms opposite sides double bond shown figure whereas fccf depiction possible representation cis12difluoroethylene side double bond
bond direction symbols always come groups least first arbitrary fccf fccf alternating singledouble bonds present groups larger middle directional symbols adjacent double bonds example common form 24hexadiene written cccccc

order branches specified smiles normally unimportant case matters swapping groups requires reversing chirality indicator branches reversed alanine written nccooc configuration also reverses lalanine written nchcooc depiction ways writing include cchncoo ocochnc ocochcn
normally first four bonds appears left carbon atom smiles written beginning chiral carbon ccncoo four right first appear bond case used reference order following three lalanine also written chcncoo
smiles specification includes elaborations symbol indicate stereochemistry around complex chiral centers trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry
