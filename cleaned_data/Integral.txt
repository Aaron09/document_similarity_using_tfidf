numerical quadrature methods rectangle trapezoid romberg gauss


using left piece rectangle method sums function values multiplies step width approximate value 394325 integral accuracy impressive calculus formally uses pieces infinitesimal width initially seem little cause concern indeed repeatedly doubling number steps eventually produces approximation 376001 however pieces required great computational expense little accuracy reach greater accuracy force steps small arithmetic precision becomes obstacle
better approach replaces rectangles used riemann trapezoids trapezoid rule almost easy calculate sums function values weights first last half multiplies step width immediately improves approximation 376925 noticeably accurate furthermore pieces needed achieve 376000 substantially less computation rectangle method comparable accuracy idea behind trapezoid rule accurate approximations function yield better approximations integral carried simpsons rule approximates integrand piecewise quadratic function riemann sums trapezoid rule simpsons rule examples family quadrature rules called newton–cotes formulas degree newton–cotes quadrature rule approximates polynomial subinterval degree polynomial polynomial chosen interpolate values function interval higher degree newtoncotes approximations accurate require function evaluations already simpsons rule requires twice function evaluations trapezoid rule suffer numerical inaccuracy runges phenomenon solution problem clenshaw–curtis quadrature integrand approximated expanding terms chebyshev polynomials produces approximation whose values never deviate original function
rombergs method builds trapezoid method great effect first step lengths halved incrementally giving trapezoid approximations denoted half step size half function values need computed others carry previous size shown table really powerful idea interpolate polynomial approximations extrapolate method numerically exact answer requires four pieces five function values lagrange polynomial interpolating hkthkk 4006128 2004352 1003908 0148h2 producing extrapolated value
gaussian quadrature often requires noticeably less work superior accuracy example compute function values positions double value numerically exact answer explanation dramatic success lies choice points unlike newton–cotes rules interpolate integrand evenly spaced points gaussian quadrature evaluates function roots orthogonal polynomials npoint gaussian method exact polynomials degree function example degree polynomial plus term cancels chosen endpoints symmetric around zero cancellation also benefits romberg method
practice method must extra evaluations ensure error bound unknown function tends offset advantage pure gaussian method motivates popular gauss–kronrod quadrature formulae broadly adaptive quadrature partitions range pieces based function properties data points concentrated needed
computation higherdimensional integrals example volume calculations makes important alternatives monte carlo integration
