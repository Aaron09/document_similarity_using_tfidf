definition similar termsedit
general distinction dynamic page kind application unclear sites likely referred applications similar functionality desktop software application mobile html5 introduced explicit language support making applications loaded pages store data locally continue function offline
singlepage applications applicationlike reject typical paradigm moving distinct pages different urls singlepage frameworks like sencha touch angularjs might used speed development mobile platform
mobile applicationsedit
information multiple phone webbased application framework
several ways targeting mobile devices making application

responsive design used make application whether conventional site singlepage application viewable small screens work well touchscreens
progressive apps hybrid regular pages websites mobile application
native apps mobile apps directly mobile device conventional software application runs directly desktop computer without browser potentially without need internet connectivity typically written java android devices objective swift devices recently frameworks like react native flutter xamarin allow development native apps platforms using languages standard native language
hybrid apps embed mobile site inside native possibly using hybrid framework like apache cordova ionic appcelerator titanium allows development using technologies possibly directly copying code existing mobile site also retaining certain advantages native apps direct access device hardware offline operation store visibility

historyedit
earlier computing models like client–server processing load application shared code server code installed client locally words application precompiled client program served user interface separately installed users personal computer upgrade serverside code application would typically also require upgrade clientside code installed user workstation adding support cost decreasing productivity addition client server components application usually tightly bound particular computer architecture operating system porting others often prohibitively expensive largest applications today course native apps mobile devices also hobbled foregoing issues
contrast applications documents written standard format html javascript supported variety browsers applications considered specific variant client–server software client software downloaded client machine visiting relevant page using standard procedures http client software updates happen time page visited session browser interprets displays pages acts universal client application
early days individual page delivered client static document sequence pages could still provide interactive experience user input returned form elements embedded page markup however every significant change page required round trip back server refresh entire page
1995 netscape introduced clientside scripting language called javascript allowing programmers dynamic elements user interface client side instead sending data server order generate entire page embedded scripts downloaded page perform various tasks input validation showinghiding parts page
1996 macromedia introduced flash vector animation player could added browsers plugin embed animations pages allowed scripting language program interactions client side need communicate server
1999 application concept introduced java language servlet specification version 2123 time javascript already developed ajax still coined xmlhttprequest object recently introduced internet explorer activex object4
2005 term ajax coined applications like gmail started make client sides interactive page script able contact server storingretrieving data without downloading entire page
2011 html5 finalized provides graphic multimedia capabilities without need client side plugins html5 also enriched semantic content documents apis document object model longer afterthoughts fundamental parts html5 specification webgl paved advanced graphics based html5 canvas javascript language significant importance creating truly platform browser independent rich applications
interfaceedit
java javascript dhtml flash silverlight technologies applicationspecific methods drawing screen playing audio access keyboard mouse possible many services worked combine familiar interface adopts appearance operating system general purpose techniques drag drop also supported technologies developers often clientside scripting functionality especially create interactive experience require page reloading recently technologies developed coordinate clientside scripting serverside technologies aspnet j2ee perlplack
ajax development technique using combination various technologies example technology creates interactive experience
structureedit
applications usually broken logical chunks called tiers every tier assigned role5 traditional applications consist tier resides client machine applications lend ntiered approach nature5 though many variations possible common structure threetiered application5 common form three tiers called presentation application storage order browser first tier presentation engine using dynamic content technology coldfusion dart jspjava nodejs python ruby rails middle tier application logic database third tier storage5 browser sends requests middle tier services making queries updates database generates user interface
complex applications 3tier solution fall short beneficial ntiered approach greatest benefit breaking business logic resides application tier finegrained model5 another benefit adding integration tier separates data tier rest tiers providing easytouse interface access data5 example client data would accessed calling listclients function instead making query directly client table database allows underlying database replaced without making change tiers5
view application twotier architecture smart client performs work queries dumb server dumb client relies smart server5 client would handle presentation tier server would database storage tier business logic application tier would both5 increases scalability applications separates display database still doesnt allow true specialization layers applications outgrow model5
business useedit
emerging strategy application software companies provide access software previously distributed local applications depending type application require development entirely different browserbased interface merely adapting existing application different presentation technology programs allow user monthly yearly software application without install local hard drive company follows strategy known application service provider asps currently receiving much attention software industry
security breaches kinds applications major concern involve enterprise information private customer data protecting assets important part application operational areas must included development process6 includes processes authentication authorization asset handling input logging auditing building security applications beginning effective less disruptive long
cloud computing model applications software service saas business applications provided saas enterprises fixed usage dependent applications offered free charge often generating income advertisements shown application interface
developmentedit
main article application development
writing application often simplified open source softwarerelevant discuss django ruby rails symfony called application frameworks frameworks facilitate rapid application development allowing development team focus parts application unique goals without resolve common development issues user management7 many frameworks open source means requirement
application frameworks often reduce number errors program making code simpler allowing team concentrate framework another focuses specified case applications exposed constant hacking attempts internet securityrelated problems caused errors program frameworks also promote best practices8 post
addition potential development applications internet operating systems although currently many viable platforms model
