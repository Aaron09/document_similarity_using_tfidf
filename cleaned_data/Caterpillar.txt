caterpillars soft bodies grow rapidly moults size varies species instars moults small head capsule hardened mandibles tough sharp chewing contrasts adult lepidoptera highly reduced soft mandibles behind mandibles caterpillar spinnerets manipulating silk antennae present either side labrum small relatively inconspicuous6

defenses




saddleback caterpillar urticating hair aposematic colouring


many animals feed caterpillars rich protein result caterpillars evolved various means defense
caterpillars evolved defenses physical conditions cold environmental conditions arctic species like gynaephora groenlandica special basking aggregation behaviours8 apart physiological adaptations remain dormant state9
appearance




costa rican hairy caterpillar spiny bristles selfdefense mechanism


appearance caterpillar often repel predator markings certain body parts make seem poisonous bigger size thus threatening nonedible types caterpillars indeed poisonous distasteful bright coloring aposematic others mimic dangerous caterpillars animals dangerous many caterpillars cryptically colored resemble plants feed example caterpillars camouflage defence species nemoria arizonaria caterpillars hatch spring feed catkins appear green hatch summer appear dark colored like twigs differential development linked tannin content diet10 caterpillars even spines growths resemble plant parts thorns look like objects environment bird droppings
chemical defenses
aggressive selfdefense measures taken caterpillars measures include spiny bristles long fine hairlike setae detachable tips irritate lodging skin mucous membranes7 however birds cuckoos swallow even hairiest caterpillars caterpillars acquire toxins host plants render unpalatable predators instance ornate moth caterpillars utilize pyrrolizidine alkaloids obtain food plants deter predators11 aggressive caterpillar defenses bristles associated venom glands bristles called urticating hairs venom among potent defensive chemicals animal produced south american silk moth genus lonomia venom anticoagulant powerful enough cause human hemorrhage death lonomiasis12 chemical investigated potential medical applications urticating hairs range effect mild irritation dermatitis




giant swallowtail caterpillar everting osmeterium defense


plants contain toxins protect herbivores caterpillars evolved countermeasures enable leaves toxic plants addition unaffected poison caterpillars sequester body making highly toxic predators chemicals also carried adult stages toxic species cinnabar moth tyria jacobaeae monarch danaus plexippus caterpillars usually advertise danger colors yellow black often bright stripes aposematism predator attempts caterpillar aggressive defense mechanism learn avoid future attempts
caterpillars regurgitate acidic digestive juices attacking enemies many papilionid larvae produce smells extrudable glands called osmeteria
defensive behaviors




caterpillars linked together train


many caterpillars display feeding behaviors allow caterpillar remain hidden potential predators many feed protected environments enclosed inside silk galleries rolled leaves mining leaf surfaces
caterpillars like early instars tomato hornworm tobacco hornworm long whiplike organs attached ends body caterpillar wiggles organs frighten away flies predatory wasps13 caterpillars evade predators using silk line dropping branches disturbed many species thrash violently disturbed scare away potential predators species amorpha juglandis even makes high pitched whistles scare away birds14
social behaviors relationships insects
caterpillars obtain protection associating ants lycaenid butterflies particularly well known communicate protectors vibrations well chemical means typically provide food rewards15
caterpillars gregarious large aggregations believed help reducing levels parasitization predation16 clusters amplify signal aposematic coloration individuals participate group regurgitation displays
pine processionary thaumetopoea pityocampa caterpillars often link long train move trees ground head lead caterpillar visible heads appear hidden17
predators
caterpillars suffer predation many animals european pied flycatcher species preys upon caterpillars flycatcher typically finds caterpillars among foliage paper wasps including genus polistes polybia catch caterpillars feed young
behavior




pasture moth caterpillar feeding capeweed


caterpillars called eating machines leaves voraciously species shed skin four five times bodies grow eventually enter pupal stage becoming adults18 caterpillars grow quickly instance tobacco hornworm increase weight tenthousandfold less twenty days adaptation enables much mechanism specialized midgut quickly transports ions lumen midgut cavity keep potassium level higher midgut cavity hemolymph19




gypsy moth caterpillar


caterpillars solely herbivorous many restricted feeding species plant others polyphagous including clothes moth feed detritus predatory prey species caterpillars hawaiian eupithecia others feed eggs insects aphids scale insects larvae parasitic cicadas leaf hoppers epipyropidae20 hawaiian caterpillars hyposmocoma molluscivora silk traps capture snails21
many caterpillars nocturnal example cutworms noctuidae family hide base plants feed night22 others gypsy moth lymantria dispar larvae change activity patterns depending density larval stage diurnal feeding early instars high densities23
economic effects




hypsipyla grandela damages mahogany brazil


caterpillars cause much damage mainly eating leaves propensity damage enhanced monocultural farming practices especially caterpillar specifically adapted host plant cultivation cotton bollworm causes enormous losses species food crops caterpillars target pest control pesticides biological control agronomic practices many species become resistant pesticides bacterial toxins bacillus thuringiensis evolved affect lepidoptera used sprays bacterial spores toxin extracts also incorporating genes produce within host plants approaches defeated time evolution resistance mechanisms insects24
plants evolve mechanisms resistance eaten caterpillars including evolution chemical toxins physical barriers hairs incorporating host plant resistance plant breeding another approach used reducing impact caterpillars crop plants25
caterpillars used industry silk industry based silkworm caterpillar
human health




buck moth caterpillar sting shin twentyfour hours occurrence south louisiana reddish mark covers area widest point length


caterpillar hair cause human health problems caterpillar hairs sometimes venoms species approximately families moths butterflies worldwide inflict serious human injuries ranging urticarial dermatitis atopic asthma osteochondritis consumption coagulopathy renal failure intracerebral hemorrhage26 skin rashes common fatalities27 lonomia frequent cause envenomation brazil cases reported 1989 2005 lethality ranging death caused often intracranial hemorrhage28
caterpillar hair also known cause keratoconjunctivitis sharp barbs caterpillar hairs lodged soft tissues mucous membranes eyes enter tissues difficult extract often exacerbating problem migrate across membrane29
becomes particular problem indoor setting hair easily enter buildings ventilation systems accumulate indoor environments small size makes difficult vented accumulation increases risk human contact indoor environments30
