main article history biotechnology
although normally first comes mind many forms humanderived agriculture clearly broad definition utilizing biotechnological system make products indeed cultivation plants viewed earliest biotechnological enterprise
agriculture theorized become dominant producing food since neolithic revolution early biotechnology earliest farmers selected bred best suited crops highest yields produce enough food support growing population crops fields became increasingly large difficult maintain discovered specific organisms byproducts could effectively fertilize restore nitrogen control pests throughout history agriculture farmers inadvertently altered genetics crops introducing environments breeding plants first forms biotechnology
processes also included early fermentation beer9 processes introduced early mesopotamia egypt china india still basic biological methods brewing malted grains containing enzymes convert starch grains sugar adding specific yeasts produce beer process carbohydrates grains broken alcohols ethanol later cultures produced process lactic acid fermentation allowed fermentation preservation forms food sauce fermentation also used time period produce leavened bread although process fermentation fully understood louis pasteurs work 1857 still first biotechnology convert food source another form
time charles darwins work life animal plant scientists already used selective breeding darwin added body work scientific observations ability science change species accounts contributed darwins theory natural selection10
thousands years humans used selective breeding improve production crops livestock food selective breeding organisms desirable characteristics mated produce offspring characteristics example technique used corn produce largest sweetest crops11
early twentieth century scientists gained greater understanding microbiology explored ways manufacturing specific products 1917 chaim weizmann first used pure microbiological culture industrial process manufacturing corn starch using clostridium acetobutylicum produce acetone united kingdom desperately needed manufacture explosives world
biotechnology also development antibiotics 1928 alexander fleming discovered mold penicillium work purification antibiotic compound formed mold howard florey ernst boris chain norman heatley form today know penicillin 1940 penicillin became available medicinal treat bacterial infections humans11

revenue industry expected grow 2008 another factor influencing biotechnology sectors success improved intellectual property rights legislation—and enforcement—worldwide well strengthened demand medical pharmaceutical products cope ageing ailing population14
rising demand biofuels expected good news biotechnology sector department energy estimating ethanol usage could reduce petroleumderived fuel consumption 2030 biotechnology sector allowed farming industry rapidly increase supply corn soybeans—the main inputs biofuels—by developing genetically modified seeds resistant pests drought boosting farm productivity biotechnology plays crucial role ensuring biofuel production targets met15
