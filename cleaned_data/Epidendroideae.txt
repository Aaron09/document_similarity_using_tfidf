plant systematics epidendroideae subfamily orchid family orchidaceae epidendroideae larger orchid subfamilies together comprising 15000 species genera epidendroid orchids tropical epiphytes typically pseudobulbs however terrestrials epipactis even mycoheterotrophs parasitic upon mycorrhizal fungi
typically contain remaining orchids single fertile anther monandrous also fully incumbent strongly convex suberect ascending towards edges anther form arises column elongation vandoids early anther bending incumbent anther forms right angle column axis pointed backward many genera hard pollinia mass waxy pollen coherent pollen grains pollinia caudicle viscidium without stigma entire threelobed beak present apical part middle stigma lobe forms stipe pollinium stalk ovary unilocular leaves distichous spiraling growing thickened stems
epidendroideae difficult classify divided “lower epidendroids” “higher epidendroids”

descriptionedit
epiphytes plants grow ground plants planted soil parasitic feed plants however types still damage host various ways growing plants epiphytes reach light better avoid struggling light many mosses lichens epiphytes approximately cent seed plants ferns epiphytes common groups plants ferns mosses lichens algae half 20000 species orchids epiphytes
habitatedit
epiphytic seed plants ferns found tropical subtropical rainforests need high humidity survive areas epiphytes grow montane rainforests epiphytic orchids found many positions host tree depending species requirements size large species grow fork whereas small species scramble thin branches species climb trunk trees provide many habitats different conditions temperature contact light temperate places epiphytes common moist forests rainforests queensland
adaptationedit
epiphytes adapted droughts flora don’t access ground still mechanisms help survive become completely dormant months time many epiphytes show crassulacean acid metabolism involves taking night photofixing closed stomata reduce water loss transpiration also contain absorptive plants capable quickly taking water available preventing drought water scarcer impeded higher nighttime temperatures dehydrated tissues high saturation deficits surrounding lower stomata conductance epiphytes reducing uptake turn reduces growth reproduction even induces carbon loss higher temperatures strain evaporation contact light cause camidling epiphyte closing stomata becomes stressed brings range habitats species inhabit epiphyte species work biomasses much sensitive different relative moisture levels plants
