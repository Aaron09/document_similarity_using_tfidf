terminologyedit
word engine derives french engin latin ingenium–the root word ingenious preindustrial weapons catapults trebuchets battering rams called siege engines knowledge construct often treated military secret word cotton short engine mechanical devices invented industrial revolution described engines—the steam engine notable example however original steam engines thomas savery mechanical engines pumps manner fire engine original form merely water pump engine transported fire horses
modern usage term engine typically describes devices like steam engines internal combustion engines burn otherwise consume fuel perform mechanical work exerting torque linear force usually form thrust devices converting heat energy motion commonly referred simply engines3 examples engines exert torque include familiar automobile gasoline diesel engines well turboshafts examples engines produce thrust include turbofans rockets
internal combustion engine invented term motor initially used distinguish steam engine—which wide time powering locomotives vehicles steam rollers term motor derives latin verb moto means motion maintain motion thus motor device imparts motion
motor engine later came used largely interchangeably casual discourse however technically words different meanings engine device burns otherwise consumes fuel changing chemical composition whereas motor device driven electricity hydraulic pressure change chemical composition energy source4 however rocketry uses term rocket motor even though consume fuel
heat engine also serve prime mover—a component transforms flow changes pressure fluid mechanical energy5 automobile powered internal combustion engine make various motors pumps ultimately devices derive power engine another looking motor receives power external source converts mechanical energy engine creates power pressure derived directly explosive force combustion chemical reaction secondarily action force substances water steam6
