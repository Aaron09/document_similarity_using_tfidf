serial flash silicon storage tech sst25vf080b


serial flash small lowpower flash memory provides serial access data rather addressing individual bytes user reads writes large contiguous groups bytes address space serially serial peripheral interface typical protocol accessing device incorporated embedded system serial flash requires fewer wires parallel flash memories since transmits receives data time permit reduction board space power consumption total system cost
several reasons serial device fewer external pins parallel device significantly reduce overall cost

many asics padlimited meaning size constrained number wire bond pads rather complexity number gates used device logic eliminating bond pads thus permits compact integrated circuit smaller increases number dies fabricated wafer thus reduces cost
reducing number external pins also reduces assembly packaging costs serial device packaged smaller simpler package parallel device
smaller lower pincount packages occupy less area
lower pincount devices simplify routing
