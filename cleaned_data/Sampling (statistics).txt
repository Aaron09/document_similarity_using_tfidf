population definitionedit
successful statistical practice based focused problem definition sampling includes defining population sample drawn population defined including people items characteristic wishes understand rarely enough time money gather information everyone everything population goal becomes finding representative sample subset population
sometimes defines population obvious example manufacturer needs decide whether batch material production high enough quality released customer sentenced scrap rework poor quality case batch population
although population interest often consists physical objects sometimes need sample time space combination dimensions instance investigation supermarket staffing could examine checkout line length various times study endangered penguins might understand usage various hunting grounds time time dimension focus periods discrete occasions
cases population even less tangible example joseph jagger studied behaviour roulette wheels casino monte carlo used identify biased wheel case population jagger wanted investigate overall behaviour wheel probability distribution results infinitely many trials sample formed observed results wheel similar considerations arise taking repeated measurements physical characteristic electrical conductivity copper
situation often arises seek knowledge cause system observed population outcome cases sampling theory treat observed population sample larger superpopulation example researcher might study success rate quit smoking program test group patients order predict effects program made available nationwide superpopulation everybody country given access treatment group exist since program isnt available
note also population sample drawn population actually want information often large complete overlap groups frame issues sometimes entirely separate instance might study rats order better understanding human health might study records people born 2008 order make predictions people born 2009
time spent making sampled population population concern precise often well spent raises many issues ambiguities questions would otherwise overlooked stage
sampling frameedit
main article sampling frame
straightforward case sampling batch material production acceptance sampling lots would desirable identify measure every single item population include sample however general case usually possible practical identify rats rats voting compulsory identify people actually vote forthcoming election advance election imprecise populations amenable sampling ways could apply statistical theory
remedy seek sampling frame property identify every single element include sample3456 straightforward type frame list elements population preferably entire population appropriate contact information example opinion poll possible sampling frames include electoral register telephone directory
probability sample sample every unit population chance greater zero selected sample probability accurately determined combination traits makes possible produce unbiased estimates population totals weighting sampled units according probability selection

example want estimate total income adults living given street visit household street identify adults living randomly select adult household example allocate person random number generated uniform distribution select person highest number household interview selected person find income
people living certain selected simply income estimate total person living household adults oneintwo chance selection reflect come household would count selected persons income twice towards total person selected household loosely viewed also representing person isnt selected

example everybody probability selection makes probability sample fact persons probability known every element population probability selection known equal probability selection design designs also referred selfweighting sampled units given weight
probability sampling includes simple random sampling systematic sampling stratified sampling probability proportional size sampling cluster multistage sampling various ways probability sampling things common

every element known nonzero probability sampled
involves random selection point

nonprobability samplingedit
main article nonprobability sampling
nonprobability sampling sampling method elements population chance selection sometimes referred coverageundercovered probability selection cant accurately determined involves selection elements based assumptions regarding population interest forms criteria selection hence selection elements nonrandom nonprobability sampling allow estimation sampling errors conditions give rise exclusion bias placing limits much information sample provide population information relationship sample population limited making difficult extrapolate sample population

example visit every household given street interview first person answer door household occupant nonprobability sample people likely answer door unemployed person spends time home likely answer employed housemate might work interviewer calls practical calculate probabilities

nonprobability sampling methods include convenience sampling quota sampling purposive sampling addition nonresponse effects turn probability design nonprobability design characteristics nonresponse well understood since nonresponse effectively modifies elements probability sampled

simple random sampling edit
main article simple random sampling




visual representation selecting simple random sample


simple random sample given size subsets frame given equal probability element frame thus equal probability selection frame subdivided partitioned furthermore given pair elements chance selection pair similarly triples minimizes bias simplifies analysis results particular variance individual results within sample good indicator variance overall population makes relatively easy estimate accuracy results
vulnerable sampling error randomness selection result sample doesnt reflect makeup population instance simple random sample people given country average produce five five women given trial likely overrepresent underrepresent systematic stratified techniques attempt overcome problem using information population choose representative sample
also cumbersome tedious sampling unusually large target population cases investigators interested research questions specific subgroups population example researchers might interested examining whether cognitive ability predictor performance equally applicable across racial groups cannot accommodate needs researchers situation provide subsamples population stratified sampling addresses weakness
systematic samplingedit
main article systematic sampling




visual representation selecting random sample using systematic sampling technique


systematic sampling also known interval sampling relies arranging study population according ordering scheme selecting elements regular intervals ordered list systematic sampling involves random start proceeds selection every element onwards case kpopulation sizesample size important starting point automatically first list instead randomly chosen within first element list simple example would select every 10th name telephone directory every 10th sample also referred sampling skip
long starting point randomized systematic sampling type probability sampling easy implement stratification induced make efficient variable list ordered correlated variable interest every 10th sampling especially useful efficient sampling databases
example suppose wish sample people long street starts poor area house ends expensive district house 1000 simple random selection addresses street could easily many high vice versa leading unrepresentative sample selecting every 10th street number along street ensures sample spread evenly along length street representing districts note always start house sample slightly biased towards randomly selecting start bias eliminated
however systematic sampling especially vulnerable periodicities list periodicity present period multiple factor interval used sample especially likely unrepresentative overall population making scheme less accurate simple random sampling
example consider street oddnumbered houses north expensive side road evennumbered houses south cheap side sampling scheme given impossible representative sample either houses sampled oddnumbered expensive side evennumbered cheap side unless researcher previous knowledge bias avoids using skip ensures jumping sides oddnumbered skip
another drawback systematic sampling even scenarios accurate theoretical properties make difficult quantify accuracy examples systematic sampling given much potential sampling error variation neighbouring houses method never selects neighbouring houses sample give information variation
described systematic sampling method elements probability selection example given simple random sampling different subsets size different selection probabilities 41424994 oneinten probability selection 4132434 zero probability selection
systematic sampling also adapted noneps approach example discussion samples
stratified samplingedit
main article stratified sampling




visual representation selecting random sample using stratified sampling technique


population embraces number distinct categories frame organized categories separate strata stratum sampled independent subpopulation individual elements randomly selected3 several potential benefits stratified sampling
first dividing population distinct independent strata enable researchers draw inferences specific subgroups lost generalized random sample
second utilizing stratified sampling method lead efficient statistical estimates provided strata selected based upon relevance criterion question instead availability samples even stratified sampling approach lead increased statistical efficiency tactic result less efficiency would simple random sampling provided stratum proportional groups size population
third sometimes case data readily available individual preexisting strata within population overall population cases using stratified sampling approach convenient aggregating data across groups though potentially odds previously noted importance utilizing criterionrelevant strata
finally since stratum treated independent population different sampling approaches applied different strata potentially enabling researchers approach best suited costeffective identified subgroup within population
however potential drawbacks using stratified sampling first identifying strata implementing approach increase cost complexity sample selection well leading increased complexity population estimates second examining multiple criteria stratifying variables related others complicating design potentially reducing utility strata finally cases designs large number strata specified minimum sample size group stratified sampling potentially require larger sample would methods although cases required sample size would larger would required simple random sampling

stratified sampling approach effective three conditions


variability within strata minimized
variability strata maximized
variables upon population stratified strongly correlated desired dependent variable


advantages sampling methods


focuses important subpopulations ignores irrelevant ones
allows different sampling techniques different subpopulations
improves accuracyefficiency estimation
permits greater balancing statistical power tests differences strata sampling equal numbers strata varying widely size


disadvantages


requires selection relevant stratification variables difficult
useful homogeneous subgroups
expensive implement


poststratification

stratification sometimes introduced sampling phase process called poststratification3 approach typically implemented lack prior knowledge appropriate stratifying variable experimenter lacks necessary information create stratifying variable sampling phase although method susceptible pitfalls post approaches provide several benefits right situation implementation usually follows simple random sample addition allowing stratification ancillary variable poststratification used implement weighting improve precision samples estimates3

oversampling

choicebased sampling stratified sampling strategies choicebased sampling7 data stratified target sample taken stratum rare target class represented sample model built biased sample effects input variables target often estimated precision choicebased sample even smaller overall sample size taken compared random sample results usually must adjusted correct oversampling
probabilityproportionaltosize samplingedit
cases sample designer access auxiliary variable size measure believed correlated variable interest element population data used improve accuracy sample design option auxiliary variable basis stratification discussed
another option probability proportional size sampling selection probability element proportional size measure maximum simple design selection probabilities used basis poisson sampling however drawback variable sample size different portions population still underrepresented chance variation selections
systematic sampling theory used create probability proportionate size sample done treating count within size variable single sampling unit samples identified selecting even intervals among counts within size variable method sometimes called ppssequential monetary unit sampling case audits forensic sampling

example suppose schools populations students respectively total 1500 students want student population basis sample size three could allocate first school numbers second school third school last school 1011 1500 generate random start equal 15003 count school populations multiples random start would select schools allocated numbers 1137 first fourth sixth schools

approach improve accuracy given sample size concentrating sample large elements greatest impact population estimates sampling commonly used surveys businesses element size varies greatly auxiliary information often available—for instance survey attempting measure number guestnights spent hotels might hotels number rooms auxiliary variable cases older measurement variable interest used auxiliary variable attempting produce current estimates8
cluster samplingedit




visual representation selecting random sample using cluster sampling technique


main article cluster sampling
sometimes costeffective select respondents groups clusters sampling often clustered geography time periods nearly samples sense clustered time although rarely taken account analysis instance surveying households within city might choose select city blocks interview every household within selected blocks
clustering reduce travel administrative costs example interviewer make single trip visit several households block rather drive different block household
also means need sampling frame listing elements target population instead clusters chosen clusterlevel frame elementlevel frame created selected clusters example sample requires blocklevel city initial selections householdlevel selected blocks rather householdlevel whole city
cluster sampling also known clustered sampling generally increases variability sample estimates simple random sampling depending clusters differ another compared withincluster variation reason cluster sampling requires larger sample achieve level accuracy cost savings clustering might still make cheaper option
cluster sampling commonly implemented multistage sampling complex form cluster sampling levels units embedded first stage consists constructing clusters used sample second stage sample primary units randomly selected cluster rather using units contained selected clusters following stages selected clusters additional samples units selected ultimate units individuals instance selected last step procedure surveyed technique thus essentially process taking random subsamples preceding random samples
multistage sampling substantially reduce sampling costs complete population list would need constructed sampling methods could applied eliminating work involved describing clusters selected multistage sampling reduce large costs associated traditional cluster sampling8 however sample full representative whole population
quota samplingedit
quota sampling population first segmented mutually exclusive subgroups stratified sampling judgement used select subjects units segment based specified proportion example interviewer told sample females males
second step makes technique nonprobability sampling quota sampling selection sample nonrandom example interviewers might tempted interview look helpful problem samples biased everyone gets chance selection random element greatest weakness quota versus probability matter controversy several years
minimax samplingedit
imbalanced datasets sampling ratio follow population statistics resample dataset conservative manner called minimax sampling minimax sampling origin anderson minimax ratio whose value proved binary classification classsample sizes chosen equally ratio proved minimax ratio assumption classifier gaussian distributions notion minimax sampling recently developed general class classification rules called classwise smart classifiers case sampling ratio classes selected worst case classifier error possible population statistics class prior probabilities would
accidental samplingedit
accidental sampling sometimes known grab convenience opportunity sampling type nonprobability sampling involves sample drawn part population close hand population selected readily available convenient meeting person including person sample meets chosen finding technological means internet phone researcher using sample cannot scientifically make generalizations total population sample would representative enough example interviewer conduct survey shopping center early morning given people heshe could interview would limited given given time would represent views members society area survey conducted different times several times week type sampling useful pilot testing several important considerations researchers using convenience samples include

controls within research design experiment serve lessen impact nonrandom convenience sample thereby ensuring results representative population
good reason believe particular convenience sample would respond behave differently random sample population
question asked research adequately answered using convenience sample

social science research snowball sampling similar technique existing study subjects used recruit subjects sample variants snowball sampling respondent driven sampling allow calculation selection probabilities probability sampling methods certain conditions
voluntary samplingedit
voluntary sampling method type nonprobability sampling voluntary sample made people selfselect survey often subjects strong interest main topic survey volunteers invited advertisements social media sites9 method suitable research done filling questionnaire target population advertisements selected characteristics like demography gender income occupation education level interests using advertising tools provided social media sites advertisement include message research link survey voluntary following link submitting based questionnaire respondent included sample population method reach global population limited advertisement budget method permit volunteers outside reference population volunteer included sample difficult make generalizations total population sample would representative enough
lineintercept samplingedit
lineintercept sampling method sampling elements region whereby element sampled chosen line segment called transect intersects element
panel samplingedit
panel sampling method first selecting group participants random sampling method asking group potentially information several times period time therefore participant interviewed time points period data collection called wave method developed sociologist paul lazarsfeld 1938 means studying political campaigns10 longitudinal samplingmethod allows estimates changes population example regard chronic illness stress weekly food expenditures panel sampling also used inform researchers withinperson health changes help explain changes continuous dependent variables spousal interaction11 several proposed methods analyzing panel data including manova growth curves structural equation modeling lagged effects
snowball samplingedit
snowball sampling involves finding small group initial respondents using recruit respondents particularly useful cases population hidden difficult enumerate
