flash memory combines number older technologies lower cost lower power consumption small size made possible advances microprocessor technology memory storage based earlier eprom eeprom technologies limited capacity slow reading writing required complex highvoltage drive circuitry could rewritten erasing entire contents chip
hardware designers later developed eeproms erasure region broken smaller fields could erased individually without affecting others altering contents particular memory location involved copying entire field offchip buffer memory erasing field modifying data required buffer rewriting field required considerable computer support pcbased eeprom flash memory systems often carried dedicated microprocessor system flash drives less miniaturized version
development highspeed serial data interfaces made semiconductor memory systems serially accessed storage viable simultaneous development small highspeed lowpower microprocessor systems allowed incorporated extremely compact systems serial access requires fewer electrical connections memory chips parallel access simplified manufacture multigigabyte drives
