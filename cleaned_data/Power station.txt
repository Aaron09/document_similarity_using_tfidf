historyedit
1870 hydro electric power station designed built lord armstrong cragside england used water lakes estate power siemens dynamos electricity supplied power lights heating produced water elevator well laborsaving devices farm buildings1
early 1870s belgian inventor zénobe gramme invented generator powerful enough produce power commercial scale industry2
autumn 1882 central station providing public power built godalming england proposed town failed reach agreement rate charged company town council decided electricity used hydroelectric power street lighting household lighting system commercial success town reverted gas3
1882 worlds first coalfired public power station edison electric light station built london project thomas edison organized edward johnson babcock wilcox boiler powered 125horsepower steam engine drove 27ton generator supplied electricity premises area could reached culverts viaduct without digging road monopoly companies customers included city temple bailey another important customer telegraph office general post office could reached though culverts johnson arranged supply cable overhead holborn tavern newgate4
september 1882 york pearl street station established edison provide electric lighting lower manhattan island area station destroyed fire 1890 station used reciprocating steam engines turn directcurrent generators distribution service area small limited voltage drop feeders currents eventually resolved favor distribution utilization although systems persisted 20th century systems service radius mile kilometer necessarily smaller less efficient fuel consumption laborintensive operate much larger central generating stations
systems used wide range frequencies depending type load lighting load using higher frequencies traction systems heavy motor load systems preferring lower frequencies economics central station generation improved greatly unified light power systems operating common frequency developed generating plant large industrial loads could feed commuter railway systems rush hour serve lighting load evening thus improving system load factor reducing cost electrical energy overall many exceptions existed generating stations dedicated power light choice frequency rotating frequency changers rotating converters particularly common feed electric railway systems general lighting power network
throughout first decades 20th century central stations became larger using higher steam pressures provide greater efficiency relying interconnections multiple generating stations improve reliability cost highvoltage transmission allowed hydroelectric power conveniently moved distant waterfalls city markets advent steam turbine central station service around 1906 allowed great expansion generating capacity generators longer limited power transmission belts relatively slow speed reciprocating engines could grow enormous sizes example sebastian ziani ferranti planned would largest reciprocating steam engine ever built proposed central station scrapped plans turbines became available necessary size building power systems central stations required combinations engineering skill financial acumen equal measure pioneers central station generation include george westinghouse samuel insull united states ferranti charles hesterman merz many others
