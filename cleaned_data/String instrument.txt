historyedit
archaeological digs identified earliest stringed instruments ancient mesopotamian sites like lyres include artifacts three thousand years development lyre instruments required technology create tuning mechanism tighten loosen string tension lyres wooden bodies strings used plucking playing represent instruments point towards later harps violintype instruments moreover indian instruments discovered anything strings
medieval instrument development varied country country middle eastern rebecs represented breakthroughs terms shape strings half pear shape using three strings early versions violin fiddle comparison emerged europe instruments gittern four stringed precursor guitar basic lutes instruments typically used catgut animal intestine materials including silk strings
string instrument design refined renaissance baroque period 1600–1750 musical history violins guitars became consistent design roughly similar 2000s present violins renaissance featured intricate woodwork stringing elaborate bass instruments bandora produced alongside quillplucked citterns spanish body guitars
19th century string instruments made widely available mass production wood string instruments part orchestras cellos violas upright basses example standard instruments chamber smaller orchestras time 19th century guitar became typically associated string models rather traditional five string versions

full list list string instruments

string instruments produce sound vibrating strings transferred body instrument pickup case electronically amplified instruments usually categorised technique used make strings vibrate primary technique case instruments apply three common techniques plucking bowing striking important difference bowing plucking former phenomenon periodic overtones kept strictly harmonic relationship fundamental2
pluckingedit
main article plucked string instrument
plucking method playing instruments veena banjo ukulele guitar harp lute mandolin sitar using either finger thumb quills plastic plectra pluck strings
instruments normally played bowing also plucked technique referred italian term pizzicato
bowingedit
main article bowed string instrument
bowing italian arco method used string instruments including violin viola cello double bass violin family viol family consists stick ribbon parallel horse tail hairs stretched ends hair coated rosin grip string moving hair across string causes stickslip phenomenon making string vibrate prompting instrument emit sound
ravanahatha oldest string instruments ancestors modern bowed string instruments rebab islamic empires persian kamanche byzantine lira bowed instruments rebec hardingfele nyckelharpa kokyū erhu igil sarangi hurdygurdy bowed wheel rarely guitar played rather plucked unique effects
strikingedit
third common method sound production stringed instruments strike string piano hammered dulcimer method sound production even though piano strikes strings felt hammers means sound produced nevertheless mellow rounded contrast sharp attack produced hard hammer strikes strings
violin family string instrument players occasionally instructed strike string stick technique called legno yields percussive sound along pitch note wellknown legno orchestral strings gustav holsts mars movement planets suite
methodsedit
aeolian harp employs unusual method sound production strings excited movement
instruments strings attached keyboards player presses keys trigger mechanism sounds strings instead directly manipulating strings include piano clavichord harpsichord keyboard instruments strings occasionally plucked bowed hand modern composers henry cowell wrote music requires player reach inside piano pluck strings directly hair wrapped around strings play rolling bell brass instrument trombone array strings however relatively rarely used special techniques
keyed string instruments small enough strolling musician play include plucked autoharp bowed nyckelharpa hurdygurdy played cranking rosined wheel
steelstringed instruments guitar bass violin played using magnetic field ebow small handheld batterypowered device magnetically excites strings electric string instrument provide sustained singing tone reminiscent held bowed violin note
third bridge plucking method player frets string strikes side opposite bridge technique mainly used electric instruments pickup amplifies local string vibration possible acoustic instruments well less effective instance player might press seventh fret guitar pluck head side make tone resonate opposed side electric instruments technique generates multitone sounds reminiscent clock bell
electric string instruments electric guitar also played without touching strings using audio feedback electric guitar plugged loud powerful guitar amplifier loudspeaker high level distortion intentionally used guitar produces sustained highpitched sounds changing proximity guitar speaker guitarist produce sounds cannot produced standard plucking picking techniques technique popularized jimi hendrix others 1960s widely used psychedelic rock heavy metal music
changing pitch vibrating stringedit
main article mersennes laws
three ways change pitch vibrating string string instruments tuned varying strings tension adjusting length mass unit length impractical instruments fingerboard played adjusting length vibrating portion strings following observations apply string infinitely flexible theoretical assumption practical applications strings infinitely flexible strung fixed supports real strings finite curvature bridge bridge motion exactly nodes vibration hence following statements proportionality approximations
lengthedit




string fingering proportional fixed3 piano


pitch adjusted varying length string2 longer string results lower pitch shorter string results higher pitch frequency inversely proportional length















displaystyle fpropto frac



string twice long produces tone half frequency octave lower
tensionedit
pitch adjusted varying tension string string less tension looser results lower pitch string greater tension tighter results higher pitch homemade washtub bass made length rope broomstick washtub produce different pitches increasing tension rope producing higher pitch reducing tension producing lower pitch frequency proportional square root tension














displaystyle fpropto sqrt



linear densityedit
pitch string also varied changing linear density mass unit length string practical applications double bass strings bass piano strings extra weight added strings winding metal string heavier metal winding produces lower pitch string equal length without metal winding seen 2016era strings double bass higherpitched string often made synthetic material sometimes animal intestine metal wrapping enable string produce much lower pitch string length wrapped many wrappings thin metal wire adds mass without making stiff frequency inversely proportional square root linear density



















displaystyle fpropto sqrt



given strings equal length tension string higher mass unit length produces lower pitch
string length scale lengthedit
length string bridge bowed plucked instruments ultimately determines distance different notes instrument example double bass range needs scale length around inches whilst violin scale inches shorter scale violin left hand easily reach range slightly octaves without shifting position bass longer scale single octave ninth reachable lower positions
contact points along stringedit




strings piano


bowed instruments normally placed perpendicularly string point halfway fingerboard bridge however different placements selected change timbre application close bridge known ponticello produces intense sometimes harsh sound acoustically emphasizes upper harmonics bowing fingerboard tasto produces purer tone less overtone strength emphasizing fundamental also known flautando since sounds less reedy flutelike
bowed instruments pose challenge instrument builders compared instruments plucked guitar bowed instruments musician must able play string time wish bowed instrument must curved bridge makes outer strings lower height inner strings curved bridge player select string time play guitars lutes bridge flat strings played plucking fingers fingernails pick moving fingers pick different positions player play different strings bowed instruments need play strings individually also limits number strings seven strings strings would impossible select individual strings note bowed strings also play bowed notes different strings time technique called double stop indeed orchestral string section instruments four strings norm exception five strings used double basses contrast stringed keyboard instruments strings used piano even though strings arranged flat bridge mechanism play notes individually
similar timbral distinctions also possible plucked string instruments selecting appropriate plucking point although difference perhaps subtle
keyboard instruments contact point along string whether hammer tangent plectrum choice made instrument designer builders combination experience acoustic theory establish right contact points
harpsichords often sets strings equal length choirs usually differ plucking points choir normal plucking point producing canonical harpsichord sound plucking point close bridge producing reedier nasal sound rich upper harmonics
production multiple notesedit
single string certain tension length produces note produce multiple notes string instruments methods enough strings cover required range different notes piano sets strings enable performer play different notes provide stop strings along length shorten part vibrates method used guitar violin family instruments produce different notes string piano harp represent first method note instrument string course multiple strings tuned note many notes piano strung choir three strings tuned alike increase volume guitar represents second method—the players fingers push string fingerboard string pressed firmly metal fret pressing string fret plucking strumming shortens vibrating part thus produces different note
zithers combine stoppable melody strings greater number open harmony chord strings instruments stoppable strings violin guitar player shorten vibrating length string using fingers directly rarely mechanical device nyckelharpa hurdygurdy instruments usually fingerboard attached neck instrument provides hard flat surface player stop strings string instruments fingerboard frets raised ridges perpendicular strings stop string precise intervals case fingerboard also called fretboard
moving frets performance usually impractical bridges koto hand moved player occasionally course single piece music many modern western harps include levers either directly moved fingers celtic harps controlled foot pedals orchestral harps raise pitch individual strings fixed amount middle eastern zither qanun equipped small levers called mandal course multiple strings incrementally retuned instrument played levers raise lower pitch string course microtone less half step
sympathetic stringsedit
main article sympathetic string
instruments employed sympathetic strings—which additional strings meant plucked strings resonate played notes creating additional tones sympathetic strings vibrate naturally various intervals unisons octaves notes sympathetic strings plucked bowed struck system used sarangi grand piano hardanger fiddle rubab
sound productionedit
acoustic instrumentsedit
also musical acoustics
vibrating string strung thick hypothetical example would make quiet sound string instruments usually constructed vibrating string coupled hollow resonating chamber soundboard violin example four strings pass thin wooden bridge resting hollow body violin pressure strings supported part small cylinder wood called soundpost violin body also fholes carved strings vibrations distributed bridge soundpost surfaces instrument thus made louder correct technical explanation allow better match acoustic impedance
sometimes said sounding board soundbox amplifies sound strings technically speaking amplification occurs energy produce sound comes vibrating string really happens sounding board instrument provides larger surface area create sound waves string larger vibrating surface moves hence produces louder sound
lute type instruments traditionally bridge holds string proper action height fretfinger board strings acoustic instruments bridge performs equally important function transmitting string energy sound instrument thereby increasing sound volume specific design materials used construction bridge instrument dramatic impact upon sound responsiveness instrument
achieving tonal characteristic effective pleasing players listeners something craft well science makers string instruments often seek high quality woods particularly spruce chosen lightness strength flexibility maple hard wood spruce used sounding boards instruments violin piano instruments banjo drum covered natural synthetic skin soundboard
acoustic instruments also made artificial materials carbon fiber fiberglass particularly larger lowerpitched instruments cellos basses
early 20th century stroh violin used diaphragmtype resonator metal horn project string sound much like early mechanical gramophones declined beginning 1920 electronic amplification power amplifiers loudspeakers developed came string instrument players electronically amplify instruments connecting system guitar amplifier
electronic amplificationedit
string instruments fitted piezoelectric magnetic pickups convert strings vibrations electrical signal amplified converted back sound loudspeakers players attach pickup traditional string instrument electrify another option solidbodied instrument reduces unwanted feedback howls squeals
amplified string instruments much louder acoustic counterparts musicians play relatively loud rock blues jazz ensembles amplified instruments also amplified tone modified using electronic effects distortion reverb wahwah
bassregister string instruments double bass electric bass amplified bass instrument amplifiers designed reproduce lowfrequency sounds modify tone amplified bass instruments range electronic bass effects available distortion chorus
symphonic stringsedit
string instruments usually used orchestra often called symphonic strings string section are4

violins divided sections—first violins second violins sections play exact instruments difference first violins play higherregister lines second violins play lowerregister parts accompaniment parts countermelodies
violas
cellos
double basses

orchestral instrumentation specifies strings often means combination string parts orchestral works rarely omit string parts often include additional string instruments especially concert harp piano baroque orchestra 1600s–1750 modern groups playing early music harpsichord almost always used play basso continuo part writtenout bass line improvised chords often theorbo lute pipe organ classical music string quartet double bass typically used cello plays bass role literature
