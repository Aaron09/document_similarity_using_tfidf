bone marrow requires extraction harvesting drilling bone typically femur iliac crest

propertiesedit
classical definition stem cell requires possesses properties

selfrenewal ability numerous cycles cell division maintaining undifferentiated state
potency capacity differentiate specialized cell types strictest sense requires stem cells either totipotent pluripotent—to able give rise mature cell type although multipotent unipotent progenitor cells sometimes referred stem cells apart said stem cell function regulated feed back mechanism

selfrenewaledit
mechanisms exist ensure stem cell population maintained

obligatory asymmetric replication stem cell divides mother cell identical original stem cell another daughter cell differentiated
stochastic differentiation stem cell develops differentiated daughter cells another stem cell undergoes mitosis produces stem cells identical original

potency definitionedit

pluripotent embryonic stem cells originate inner cell mass cells within blastocyst stem cells become tissue body excluding placenta cells earlier stage embryo known morula totipotent able become tissues body extraembryonic placenta

potency specifies differentiation potential potential differentiate different cell types stem cell4

totipotent omnipotent stem cells differentiate embryonic extraembryonic cell types cells construct complete viable organism4 cells produced fusion sperm cell cells produced first divisions fertilized also totipotent5
pluripotent stem cells descendants totipotent cells differentiate nearly cells4 cells derived three germ layers6
multipotent stem cells differentiate number cell types closely related family cells4
oligopotent stem cells differentiate cell types lymphoid myeloid stem cells4
unipotent cells produce cell type own4 property selfrenewal distinguishes nonstem cells progenitor cells cannot selfrenew
