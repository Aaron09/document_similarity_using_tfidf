body plan ship showing hull form


hydrostatics concerns conditions vessel subjected rest water ability remain afloat involves computing buoyancy displacement hydrostatic properties trim measure longitudinal inclination vessel stability ability vessel restore upright position inclined wind loading conditions5
hydrodynamicsedit
hydrodynamics concerns flow water around ships hull stern bodies propeller blades rudder thruster tunnels resistance resistance towards motion water primarily caused flow water around hull powering calculation done based propulsion move vessel water using propellers thrusters water jets sails engine types mainly internal combustion vessels electrically powered using nuclear solar energy ship motions involves motions vessel seaway responses waves wind controllability maneuvering involves controlling maintaining position direction vessel
flotation stabilityedit
atop liquid surface floating body degrees freedom movements categorized either rotation translation

fore translation termed surge
transverse translation termed sway
vertical translation termed heave
rotation transverse axis termed trim pitch
rotation fore axis termed heel roll
rotation vertical axis termed

longitudinal stability longitudinal inclinations stability depends upon distance center gravity longitudinal metacenter words basis ship maintains center gravity distance equally apart forward section ship
body floats liquid surface still encounters force gravity pushing order stay afloat avoid sinking opposed force acting body known hydrostatic pressures forces acting body must magnitude line motion order maintain body equilibrium description equilibrium present freely floating body still water conditions present magnitude forces shifts drastically creating swaying motion body6
buoyancy force equal weight body words mass body equal mass water displaced body adds upward force body amount surface area times area displaced order create equilibrium surface body surface water
stability ship conditions able overcome form restriction resistance encountered rough seas however ships undesirable roll characteristics balance oscillations roll times oscillations heave thus causing ship capsize7
