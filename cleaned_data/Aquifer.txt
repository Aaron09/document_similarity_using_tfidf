classificationedit
diagram indicates typical flow directions crosssectional view simple confined unconfined aquifer system system shows aquifers aquitard confining impermeable layer surrounded bedrock aquiclude contact gaining stream typical humid regions water table unsaturated zone also illustrated aquitard zone within earth restricts flow groundwater aquifer another aquitard sometimes completely impermeable called aquiclude aquifuge aquitards composed layers either clay nonporous rock hydraulic conductivity
saturated versus unsaturatededit
groundwater found nearly every point earths shallow subsurface degree although aquifers necessarily contain fresh water earths crust divided regions saturated zone phreatic zone aquifers aquitards available spaces filled water unsaturated zone also called vadose zone still pockets contain water filled water
saturated means pressure head water greater atmospheric pressure gauge pressure definition water table surface pressure head equal atmospheric pressure gauge pressure
unsaturated conditions occur water table pressure head negative absolute pressure never negative gauge pressure water incompletely fills pores aquifer material suction water content unsaturated zone held place surface adhesive forces rises water table zerogaugepressure isobar capillary action saturate small zone phreatic surface capillary fringe less atmospheric pressure termed tension saturation saturation watercontent basis water content capillary fringe decreases increasing distance phreatic surface capillary head depends soil pore size sandy soils larger pores head less clay soils small pores normal capillary rise clayey soil less feet range
capillary rise water smalldiameter tube involves physical process water table level water rise largediameter pipe well goes aquifer open atmosphere
also water content soil moisture
aquifers versus aquitardsedit
aquifers typically saturated regions subsurface produce economically feasible quantity water well spring sand gravel fractured bedrock often make good aquifer materials
aquitard zone within earth restricts flow groundwater aquifer another completely impermeable aquitard called aquiclude aquifuge aquitards comprise layers either clay nonporous rock hydraulic conductivity
mountainous areas near rivers mountainous areas main aquifers typically unconsolidated alluvium composed mostly horizontal layers materials deposited water processes rivers streams crosssection looking twodimensional slice aquifer appear layers alternating coarse fine materials coarse materials high energy needed move tend found nearer source mountain fronts rivers whereas finegrained material make farther source flatter parts basin overbank areas—sometimes called pressure area since less finegrained deposits near source place aquifers often unconfined sometimes called forebay area hydraulic communication land surface
also hydraulic conductivity storativity
confined versus unconfinededit
members spectrum types aquifers confined unconfined semiconfined unconfined aquifers sometimes also called water table phreatic aquifers upper boundary water table phreatic surface biscayne aquifer typically always shallowest aquifer given location unconfined meaning confining layer aquitard aquiclude surface term perched refers ground water accumulating lowpermeability unit strata clay layer term generally used refer small local area ground water occurs elevation higher regionally extensive aquifer difference perched unconfined aquifers size perched smaller confined aquifers aquifers overlain confining layer often made clay confining layer might offer protection surface contamination
distinction confined unconfined clear geologically known clear confining layer exists geology complex fractured bedrock aquifer value storativity returned aquifer test used determine although aquifer tests unconfined aquifers interpreted differently confined ones confined aquifers storativity values much less little 10−5 means aquifer storing water using mechanisms aquifer matrix expansion compressibility water typically quite small quantities unconfined aquifers storativities typically called specific yield greater bulk volume release water storage mechanism actually draining pores aquifer releasing relatively large amounts water drainable porosity aquifer material minimum volumetric water content
also porosity storativity
isotropic versus anisotropicedit
isotropic aquifers aquifer layers hydraulic conductivity equal flow directions anisotropic conditions differs notably horizontal vertical sense
semiconfined aquifers aquitards work anisotropic system even separate layers isotropic compound values different hydraulic transmissivity hydraulic resistance
calculating flow drains flow wells aquifer anisotropy taken account lest resulting design drainage system faulty
