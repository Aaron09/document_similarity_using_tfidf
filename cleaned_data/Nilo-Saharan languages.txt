showing distribution nilosaharan languages



nilosaharan languages proposed family african languages spoken 50–60 million people mainly upper parts chari nile rivers including historic nubia north tributaries nile meet languages extend nations northern half africa algeria benin west libya democratic republic congo centre egypt tanzania east
indicated hyphenated name nilosaharan family african interior including greater nile basin central sahara desert eight proposed constituent divisions excluding kunama kuliak songhay found modern nations sudan south sudan nile river flows
1963 book languages africa joseph greenberg named group argued genetic family contains languages included niger–congo afroasiatic khoisan groups sufficiently demonstrated nilosaharan languages constitute valid genetic grouping linguists seen phylum greenbergs wastebasket placed otherwise unaffiliated nonclick languages africa12 supporters accept challenging proposal demonstrate contend looks promising work done345
constituent groups nilosaharan estimated predate african neolithic thus unity eastern sudanic estimated date least millennium nilosaharan genetic unity would necessarily much older still date late upper paleolithic
larger classification system accepted linguists however glottolog 2013 example publication planck institute germany recognise unity nilosaharan family even eastern sudanic branch georgiy starostin 2016 likewise accept relationship branches nilosaharan though leaves open possibility prove related necessary reconstructive work done

although progress made since greenberg established plausibility family nilosaharan actually demonstrated koman gumuz remain poorly attested difficult work arguments continue inclusion songhai blench 2010 believes distribution nilosaharan reflects waterways sahara 12000 years protolanguage noun classifiers today reflected diverse range prefixes suffixes number marking
internal relationshipsedit
dimmendaal 2008 notes greenberg 1963 based conclusion sound evidence proposal whole become convincing decades since mikkola 1999 reviewed greenbergs evidence found convincing roger blench notes morphological similarities putative branches leads believe family likely valid
koman gumuz however poorly known difficult evaluate recently songhai markedly divergent probably massive influence mande languages also problematic kuliak languages spoken huntergatherers appear retain nonnilosaharan core blench believes similar hadza dahalo shifted incompletely nilosaharan
dimmendaal originally supported inclusion believes kadu languages form small family anbessa tefera peter unseth consider poorly attested shabo language nilosaharan though unclassified within family lack data dimmendaal considers language isolate current evidence proposals sometimes made mande usually included niger–congo largely many noteworthy similarities songhay rather nilosaharan whole
extinct meroitic language ancient kush accepted linguists rille dimmendaal blench nilosaharan though others argue afroasiatic affiliation poorly attested
little doubt constituent families nilosaharan—of eastern sudanic central sudanic show much internal diversity—are valid groups however several conflicting classifications grouping together proposed higherorder groups rejected researchers greenbergs chari–nile bender blench benders core nilosaharan dimmendaal blench remains eight dimmendaal twelve bender constituent families consensus arrangement

starostin 2016edit
georgiy starostin 201611 using lexicostatistics based swadesh lists slightly inclusive glottolog addition finds probable possible links families require reconstruction protolanguages confirmation
addition families listed glottolog previous section starostin considers following established

northern eastern sudanic nubian nara tama nyima
southern eastern sudanic surmic temein jebel daju nilotic though exact relationships remain obscure
central sudanic including birri kresh–aja prove closest
koman including gule

relationship nyima nubian nara tama considered highly likely close enough proper comparative work able demonstrate connection valid though would fall outside proper eastern sudanic languages
units highly likely eventually prove valid families

east sudanic whole
central sudanic kadu central sudanic kadugli–krongo
maba–kunama maban kunama
komuz koman gumuz

summary level certainty nilosaharan constitutes distinct separate language families eastern sudanic central sudanic kadu maba–kunama komuz saharan songhai kuliak berta shabo
