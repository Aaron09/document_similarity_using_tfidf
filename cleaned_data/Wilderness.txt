critiqueedit




cedar mountain wilderness northern utah united states


american concept wilderness criticized nature writers example william cronon writes calls wilderness ethic cult teach dismissive even contemptuous humble places experiences wilderness tends privilege parts nature expense others using example mighty canyon inspiring humble marsh36 clearly visible fact nearly national parks preserve spectacular canyons mountains 1940s swamp became national park—the everglades mid20th century national parks started protect biodiversity simply attractive scenery
cronon also believes passion save wilderness poses serious threat responsible environmentalism writes allows people give permission evade responsibility lives actually leadto extent live urbanindustrial civilization time pretend real home wilderness36
michael pollan argued wilderness ethic leads people dismiss areas whose wildness less absolute book second nature pollan writes landscape longer virgin typically written fallen lost nature irredeemable37 another challenge conventional notion wilderness comes robert winkler book going wild adventures birds suburban wilderness walks unpeopled parts suburbs winkler writes i’ve witnessed wild creatures struggles survival natural beauty associate true wilderness38 attempts made pennsylvania scenic rivers distinguish wild various levels human influence wild rivers impounded usually accessible except trail watersheds shorelines essentially primitive39
another source criticism criteria wilderness designation vague open interpretation example wilderness states wilderness must roadless definition given roadless absences roads improved maintained mechanical means insure relatively regular continuous use40 however added subdefinitions essence made standard unclear open interpretation
coming different direction criticism deep ecology movement argues conflating wilderness wilderness reservations viewing latter term oxymoron allowing human construct define nature unavoidably voids freedom independence human control defines wilderness41 true wilderness requires ability life undergo speciation little interference humanity possible42 anthropologist scholar wilderness layla abdelrahim argues necessary understand principles govern economies mutual diversification wilderness nonanthropocentric perspective43
