debasementedit
main article debasement
throughout history monarchs governments often created coinage supply precious metals would allow coins pure metal replacing fraction coins precious metal content base metal often copper nickel intrinsic value individual coin reduced thereby debasing money allowing coining authority produce coins would otherwise possible debasement occasionally occurs order make coin physically harder therefore less likely worn quickly usual reason profit difference face value metal value debasement money almost always leads price inflation sometimes price controls time also instituted governing authority historically generally proved unworkable
united states unusual slightly modified coinage system except images symbols coins changed number times accommodate centuries inflation onecent coin changed little since 1856 though composition changed 1982 remove virtually copper coin still remains circulation despite greatly reduced purchasing power spectrum largest coin common circulation valued cents value largest denomination coin compared many countries increases prices copper nickel zinc meant fivecent coins became worth metal content face fiat value particular copper onecent pieces dated prior 1982 1982dated coins contained cents worth copper
