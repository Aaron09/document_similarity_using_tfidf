assumptions definitionsedit
microeconomic theory typically begins study single rational utility maximizing individual economists rationality means individual possesses stable preferences complete transitive technical assumption preference relations continuous needed ensure existence utility function although microeconomic theory continue without assumption would make comparative statics impossible since guarantee resulting utility function would differentiable
microeconomic theory progresses defining competitive budget subset consumption point economists make technical assumption preferences locally nonsatiated without assumption local nonsatiation guarantee rational individual would maximize utility necessary tools assumptions place utility maximization problem developed
utility maximization problem heart consumer theory utility maximization problem attempts explain action axiom imposing rationality axioms consumer preferences mathematically modeling analyzing consequences utility maximization problem serves mathematical foundation consumer theory metaphysical explanation well utility maximization problem used economists explain individuals make choices individuals make choices well
utility maximization problem constrained optimization problem individual seeks maximize utility subject budget constraint economists extreme value theorem guarantee solution utility maximization problem exists since budget constraint bounded closed solution utility maximization problem exists economists call solution utility maximization problem walrasian demand function correspondence
utility maximization problem developed taking consumer tastes consumer utility primitive however alternative develop microeconomic theory taking consumer choice primitive model microeconomic theory referred revealed preference theory




supply demand model describes prices vary result balance product availability price supply desires purchasing power price demand graph depicts rightshift demand along consequent increase price quantity required reach marketclearing equilibrium point supply curve


theory supply demand usually assumes markets perfectly competitive implies many buyers sellers market none capacity significantly influence prices goods services many reallife transactions assumption fails individual buyers sellers ability influence prices quite often sophisticated analysis required understand demandsupply equation good model however theory works well situations meeting assumptions
mainstream economics assume priori markets preferable forms social organization fact much analysis devoted cases market failures lead resource allocation suboptimal creates deadweight loss classic example suboptimal resource allocation public good cases economists attempt find policies avoid waste either directly government control indirectly regulation induces market participants manner consistent optimal welfare creating missing markets enable efficient trading none previously existed
studied field collective action public choice theory optimal welfare usually takes paretian norm mathematical application kaldor–hicks method diverge utilitarian goal maximizing utility consider distribution goods people market failure positive economics microeconomics limited implications without mixing belief economist theory
demand various commodities individuals generally thought outcome utilitymaximizing process individual trying maximize utility budget constraint given consumption
topicsedit
study microeconomics involves several areas
demand supply equilibriumedit
main article supply demand
supply demand economic model price determination perfectly competitive market concludes perfectly competitive market externalities unit taxes price controls unit price particular good price quantity demanded consumers equals quantity supplied producers price results stable economic equilibrium
measurement elasticitiesedit
main article elasticity economics
elasticity measurement responsive economic variable change another variable elasticity quantified ratio percentage change variable percentage change another variable later variable causal influence former tool measuring responsiveness variable function determines changes causative variables unitless ways frequently used elasticities include price elasticity demand price elasticity supply income elasticity demand elasticity substitution constntelasticity substitution factors production elasticity intertemporal substitution
consumer demand theoryedit
main article consumer choice
consumer demand theory relates preferences consumption goods services consumption expenditures ultimately relationship preferences consumption expenditures used relate preferences consumer demand curves link personal preferences consumption demand curve closely studied relations economics analyzing consumers achieve equilibrium preferences expenditures maximizing utility subject consumer budget constraints
theory productionedit
main article production theory
production theory study production economic process converting inputs outputs production uses resources create good service suitable giftgiving gift economy exchange market economy include manufacturing storing shipping packaging economists define production broadly economic activity consumption every commercial activity final purchase form production
costs productionedit
main article costofproduction theory value
costofproduction theory value states price object condition determined cost resources went making cost comprise factors production labour capital land technology viewed either form fixed capital explant circulating capital exintermediate goods
perfect competitionedit
main article perfect competition
perfect competition describes markets participants large enough market power price homogeneous product good example would digital marketplaces ebay many different sellers sell similar products many different buyers
benefits perfect competition knowledge price information pertaining goods equally dispersed among buyers sellers barriers enter market monopoly usually occur goods products advertisement required helps save advertisement cost perfect competition products identical
monopolyedit
main article monopoly
monopoly greek monos μόνος alone single polein πωλεῖν sell exists single company supplier particular commodity
benefits monopoly market prices monopoly market stable firm competition absence competition high profits leads high number sales monopoly firms tend receive super profits operations
oligopolyedit
main article oligopoly
oligopoly market form market industry dominated small number sellers oligopolists oligopolies create incentive firms engage collusion form cartels reduce competition leading higher prices consumers less overall market output5
benefits oligopoly market less competition firm tends massive profitit also able easily compare prices forces companies keep prices competition companies involved marketeach company scrambles come latest greatest thing order sway consumers company different
market structureedit
market structure several types interacting market systems different forms markets feature capitalism advocates socialism often criticize markets substitute markets economic planning varying degrees competition regulatory mechanism market system market structures include

monopolistic competition type imperfect competition many producers sell products differentiated another branding quality hence perfect substitutes
oligopoly market small number firms together control majority market share

duopoly special case oligopoly firms game theory elucidate behavior duopolies oligopolies6


monopsony buyer market
oligopsony market many sellers present meet buyers
monopoly provider product service
natural monopoly monopoly economies scale cause efficiency increase continuously size firm firm becomes natural monopoly succeeds serving entire market demand lower cost combination smaller specialized firms
perfect competition theoretical market structure features barriers entry unlimited number producers consumers perfectly elastic demand curve

examples markets include limited commodity markets insurance markets bond markets energy markets flea markets debt markets stock markets online auctions media exchange markets realestate market
game theoryedit
main article game theory
game theory major method used mathematical economics business modeling competing behaviors interacting agents term game implies study strategic interaction people applications include wide array economic phenomena approaches auctions bargaining mergers acquisitions pricing fair division duopolies oligopolies social network formation agentbased computational economics general equilibrium mechanism designand voting systems across broad areas experimental economics behavioral economics information economics industrial organization political economy
labor economicsedit
main article labor economics
labor economics seeks understand functioning dynamics markets wage labor labor markets function interaction workers employers labor economics looks suppliers labor services workers demands labor services employers attempts understand resulting pattern wages employment income economics labor measure work done human beings conventionally contrasted factors production land capital theories developed concept called human capital referring skills workers possess necessarily actual work although also counter posing macroeconomic system theories think human capital contradiction terms
welfare economicsedit
main article welfare economics
welfare economics branch economics uses microeconomics techniques evaluate wellbeing allocation productive factors desirability economic efficiency within economy often relative competitive general equilibrium7 analyzes social welfare however measured terms economic activities individuals compose theoretical society considered accordingly individuals associated economic activities basic units aggregating social welfare whether group community society social welfare apart welfare associated individual units
economics informationedit
main article information economics
information economics economics information branch microeconomic theory studies information information systems affect economy economic decisions information special characteristics easy create hard trust easy spread hard control influences many decisions special characteristics compared types goods complicate many standard economic theories8
opportunity costedit
main article opportunity cost
opportunity cost activity goods equal best next alternative usesforgone although opportunity cost hard quantify effect opportunity cost universal real individual level fact principle applies decisions economic ones
opportunity cost measure cost something rather merely identifying adding costs project also identify next best alternative spend amount money forgone profit next best alternative opportunity cost original choice common example farmer chooses farm land rather rent neighbors wherein opportunity cost forgone profit renting case farmer expect generate profit alone kind reasoning important part calculation discount rates discounted cash flow investment valuation methodologies similarly opportunity cost attending university lost wages student could earned workforce rather cost tuition books requisite items whose makes total cost attendance
note opportunity cost available alternatives rather benefit single best alternative possible opportunity costs citys decision build hospital vacant land loss land sporting center inability land parking money could made selling land loss various possible uses aggregate true opportunity cost would forgone profit lucrative listed
question arises determine money value alternative facilitate comparison assess opportunity cost less difficult depending things trying compare example many decisions involve environmental impacts whose monetary value difficult assess scientific uncertainty valuing human life economic impact arctic spill involves making subjective choices ethical implications
imperative understand decision allocating time free matter chooses always giving something return example opportunity cost deciding going concert homework decides concert giving valuable time study choose homework cost giving concert decision allocating capital likewise opportunity cost capital hurdle rate defined expected rate could investing similar projects open market opportunity cost vital understanding microeconomics decisions made
