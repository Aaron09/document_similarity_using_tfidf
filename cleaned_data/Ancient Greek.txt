reduplicationedit
almost forms perfect pluperfect future perfect reduplicate initial syllable verb stem note irregular forms perfect reduplicate whereas handful irregular aorists reduplicate three types reduplication

syllabic reduplication verbs beginning single consonant cluster stop sonorant syllable consisting initial consonant followed aspirated consonant however reduplicates unaspirated equivalent grassmanns
augment verbs beginning vowel well beginning cluster indicated previously occasionally verbs reduplicate fashion augment remains forms perfect indicative
attic reduplication verbs beginning followed sonorant occasionally reduplicate adding syllable consisting initial vowel following consonant lengthening following vowel hence erēr anēn olōl edēd actually specific attic greek despite name generalized attic originally involved reduplicating cluster consisting laryngeal sonorant hence h₃leh₃l olōl normal greek development laryngeals forms stop analogous
