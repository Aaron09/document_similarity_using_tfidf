buganda crisis 1962–1966
uganda’s immediate postindependence years dominated relationship central government largest regional kingdom buganda27 indeed understanding relationship critical understanding current political social elements forged continue shape uganda
moment british created uganda protectorate issue manage largest monarchy within framework unitary state always problem colonial governors failed come formula worked complicated buganda’s nonchalant attitude issue buganda never sought independence rather appeared comfortable loose arrangement guaranteed privileges subjects protectorate special status british left best demonstrated battle british governor cohen kabaka subjects prior independence28
within buganda divisions wanted kabaka remain dominant monarch wanted join rest uganda create modern secular state split resulted creation dominant buganda based parties kabaka yekka kabaka democratic party roots catholic church bitterness parties extremely intense especially first elections postcolonial parliament approached kabaka particularly disliked leader benedicto kiwanuka29
outside buganda quiet spoken politician milton obote northern uganda forged alliance nonbuganda politicians form uganda people’s congress heart dominated politicians wanted rectify regional inequality favoured bugandas special status drew substantial support outside buganda party however remained loose alliance interests obote showed great skill negotiating common ground based federal formula30
independence buganda question remained unresolved uganda colonial territories achieved independence without dominant political party clear majority parliament preindependence elections candidates buganda directly elected seats outside buganda seats outside buganda special status granted buganda meant buganda seats elected proportional representation reflecting elections buganda parliament lukikko resounding victory winning seats
held balance power bitterness buganda walked kabaka seek alliance enhanced obote’s promise keep buganda’s special status grant kabaka ceremonial presidential role
thus entered coalition boosted nine seats allocated parliament three additional seat allocated attorney general given buganda supporter godfrey binaisa parliamentary seats uganda celebrated independence still short majority dependant rule obote became prime minister promised kabaka became ceremonial president
arrangement almost immediate impact opposition especially among shared many values espoused years independence 1964 trickle defections meant achieved absolute majority parliament longer needed support without formal announcement coalition arrangement ended although kabaka remained president
reached high 1964 leader parliament basil bataringaya crossed parliamentary floor five leaving nine seats particularly happy leader benedicto kiwanukas hostility towards kabaka hindering chances compromise ky31 trickle defections turned flood members crossed floor realised formal coalition longer viable obote’s charismatic speeches across country sweeping winning almost every local election held increasing control district councils legislatures outside buganda32 response kabaka mute probably content ceremonial role symbolism part country however also major divisions within palace made difficult effectively obote time uganda become independent buganda divided house contending social political forces33 however problems brewing inside ranks swelled ethnic religious regional personal interests began shake party party’s apparent strength eroded complex sequence factional conflicts central regional structures 1966 tearing apart conflicts intensified newcomers crossed parliamentary floor ky34

tribal nature ugandan politics also manifesting government previously national party began break along tribal lines ibingira challenged obote northsouth ethnic divide evident economic social spheres entrenched politics obote surrounded mainly northern politicians neykon felix onama alex ojera ibingira’s supporters subsequently arrested jailed mainly south george magezi kirya matthias ngobi time factions acquired ethnic labels bantu mainly southern ibingira faction nilotic mainly northern obote faction perception government bantu enhanced obote arrested imprisoned mainly bantu ministers backed ibingira37
labels brought powerful influences first buganda people buganda bantu therefore naturally aligned ibingira faction ibingira faction advanced alliance accusing obote wanting overthrow kabaka37 aligned opposing obote second security forces british colonialists recruited army police almost exclusively northern uganda perceived suitability roles independence army police dominated northern tribes mainly nilotic would feel affiliated obote took full advantage consolidate power april 1966 obote passed eight hundred army recruits moroto seventy percent came northern region38
true time tendency central government security forces dominated northerners particularly acholi significant access government positions national level39 northern uganda also varied degrees antibuganda feelings particularly kingdoms special status independence economic social benefits came status obote brought significant numbers northerners central state civil service military created patronage machine northern uganda39 however bantu nilotic labels represent significant ambiguities bantu category example includes buganda bunyoro historically bitter rivals nilotic label includes lugbara acholi langi bitter rivalries define uganda’s military politics later despite ambiguities events unwittingly brought fore northernersoutherner political divide extent still influences ugandan politics
fragmentation continued opponents sensed obote’s vulnerability local level dominated councils discontent began challenge incumbent council leaders even obote’s home district attempts made oust head local district council 1966 worrying fact next national elections loomed 1967 without support likely back growing factionalism real possibility would power months
