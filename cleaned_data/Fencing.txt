épée lines separate wires lamé depressed connects lines resulting valid touch however touching opponents weapon line grounded strip nothing happens depressed current redirected line grounded strips particularly important épée without touch floor registers valid touch rather offtarget foil

techniques movements fencing divided categories offensive defensive techniques fall categories beat certain techniques used offensively purpose landing opponent holding right foil sabre others used defensively protect obtain right
attacks defences performed countless combinations feet hand actions example fencer attacks fencer drawing high outside parry fencer follows parry high line riposte fencer expecting makes parry pivoting blade fencer weapon straight less straight putting fencer target fencer scoring line angulating hand upwards
whenever point scored fencers back starting mark fight start following commands given referee french international settings garde guard êtesvous prêts ready allez fence
offensive

attack basic fencing technique also called thrust consisting initial offensive action made extending continuously threatening opponents target four different attacks straight thrust disengage attack counterdisengage attack cutover sabre attacks also made cutting action
riposte attack defender successful parry attacker completed attack parried defender opportunity make attack foil sabre take right
feint false attack purpose provoking reaction opposing fencer
lunge thrust extending front using slight kicking motion propelling body forward back
beat attack foil sabre attacker beats opponents blade gain priority right continues attack target area épée similar beat made intention disturb opponents thus score single light
disengage blade action whereby blade moved around opponents blade threaten different part target deceive parry
compound attack attack preceded feints oblige opponent parry allowing attacker deceive parry
continuationrenewal attack typical épée action making attack first attack parried done change line example attack high line opponents bellguard shoulder followed attack line opponents bellguard thigh foot outside line outside bellguard outer inside line inside bellguard inner chest second continuation stepping slight past parry angulating blade bring blade back target renewal also direct without change line blade action case called remise foil sabre renewal considered lost right defenders immediate riposte lands score instead renewal
flick technique used primarily foil épée takes advantage extreme flexibility blade like whip bending blade curves strikes opponent point allows fencer obscured part target back shoulder épée wrist even covered guard technique become much difficult timing changes require point stay depressed longer light

defensive

parry basic defence technique block opponents weapon preparing executing attack deflect blade away fencers valid area foil sabre give fencer right usually followed riposte return attack defender
circle parry parry weapon move circle catch opponents deflect away
counter attack basic fencing technique attacking opponent generally moving back opponents attack used quite often épée score attackers handarm difficult accomplish foil sabre unless quick enough make counterattack retreat ahead advancing opponent without scored upon evading attacking blade moves quartata turning side passatasotto ducking counterattacks also executed opposition grazing along opponents blade deflecting cause attack miss
pointinline specific position straight point threatening opponents target area foil sabre gives priority extension completed opponent begins final action attack performed defensive action attacker must disturb extended weapon retake priority otherwise defender priority pointinline touch attacker manage single light épée priority move used means either fencer achieve doubletouch advance score fencer weapons pointinline position commonly used slow opponents advance cause delay execution attack
