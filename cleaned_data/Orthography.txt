etymology meaningedit
english word orthography dates 15th century comes french orthographie latin orthographia derives greek ὀρθός orthós correct γράφειν gráphein write1
orthography largely concerned matters spelling particular relationship phonemes graphemes language23 elements considered part orthography include hyphenation capitalization word breaks emphasis punctuation4 orthography thus describes defines symbols used writing language rules regarding symbols
natural languages developed oral languages writing systems usually crafted adapted ways representing spoken language rules tend become standardized given language leading development orthography generally considered correct linguistics term orthography often used refer method writing language without judgment right wrong scientific understanding orthographic standardization exists spectrum strength convention original sense word though implies dichotomy correct incorrect word still often used refer specifically thoroughly standardized prescriptively correct writing language distinction made etic emic viewpoints purely descriptive etic approach simply considers system actually used—and emic view takes account language users perceptions correctness
units notationedit
orthographic units letters alphabet technically called graphemes type abstraction analogous phonemes spoken languages different physical forms written symbols considered represent grapheme differences significant meaning example different forms letter considered represent single grapheme orthography english
graphemes sequences sometimes placed angle brackets ⟨back⟩ distinguishes phonemic transcription placed slashes phonetic transcription placed square brackets
typesedit
writing systems orthographies based divided number types depending type unit symbol serves represent principal types logographic symbols representing words morphemes syllabic symbols representing syllables alphabetic symbols roughly representing phonemes many writing systems combine features types number detailed classifications proposed japanese example language written three logographic kanji syllabic hiragana katakana alphabetic romaji5
correspondence pronunciationedit
orthographies alphabets syllabaries based principle written symbols graphemes correspond units sound spoken language phonemes former case syllables latter however virtually cases correspondence exact different languages orthographies offer different degrees correspondence spelling pronunciation english orthography example highly irregular whereas orthographies languages russian spanish finnish represent pronunciation much faithfully although correspondence letters phonemes still exact bosnian croatian serbian orthographies remarkably consistent approximation principle letter sound
orthography correspondences spelling pronunciation highly complex inconsistent called deep orthography less formally language said irregular spelling orthography relatively simple consistent correspondences called shallow language regular spelling
main reasons spelling pronunciation deviate sound changes taking place spoken language always reflected orthography hence spellings correspond historical rather presentday pronunciation consequence many spellings come reflect words morphophonemic structure rather purely phonemic structure example english regular past tense morpheme consistently spelled spite different pronunciations various words discussed phonemic orthography morphophonemic features
syllabary systems japanese hiragana katakana examples almost perfectly shallow orthographies kana correspond almost perfect consistency spoken syllables although exceptions symbols reflect historical morphophonemic features notably rather pronunciation standard tokyo dialect character voicing underlying rendaku represent sounds relics historical kana usage
korean hangul system also originally extremely shallow orthography representation modern language frequently also reflects morphophonemic features
full discussion degrees correspondence spelling pronunciation alphabetic orthographies including reasons correspondence break phonemic orthography
defective orthographiesedit
orthography based principle symbols correspond phonemes cases lack characters represent phonemes phonemic distinctions language called defective orthography example english lack indication stress another digraph represents different phonemes thin systematic example abjads like arabic hebrew alphabets short vowels normally left unwritten must inferred reader
alphabet borrowed original language language—as done latin alphabet many languages japanese katakana nonjapanese words—it often proves defective representing languages phonemes sometimes problem addressed devices digraphs english pairs letters represent single sounds diacritics like caron letters represent sounds czech addition completely symbols languages introduced letter latin alphabet symbols another alphabet rune icelandic
classical period greek developed lowercase letter system introduced diacritic marks enable foreigners learn pronunciation cases grammatical features however pronunciation letters changed time diacritic marks reduced representing stressed syllable modern greek typesetting system simplified single accent indicate syllable stressed6
