armenian church believes apostolic succession apostles bartholomew thaddeus567 according legend latter apostles said cured abgar edessa leprosy image edessa leading conversion thaddaeus commissioned abgar proselytize throughout armenia converted king sanatruks daughter eventually martyred alongside thaddeus sanatruk later fell apostasy bartholomew came armenia bringing portrait virgin mary placed nunnery founded former temple anahit bartholomew converted sister sanatruk martyred female relative apostle converted apostles ordained native bishops execution armenians ordained outside armenia james just67 scholars including bart ehrman drijvers bauer dismiss conversion abgar fiction
according eusebius tertullian armenian christians persecuted kings axidares khosrov tiridates last converted christianity gregory illuminator5 ancient armenias adoption christianity state religion first state referred nina garsoïan probably crucial step history9 conversion distinguished iranian mazdean roots protected parthian influence59 scholarswho well stated acceptance christianity arsacidarmenian rulers partly defiance sassanids10
king trdat made christianity state religion armenia entirely religion penetrated country least third century present even earlier11
tiridates declared gregory first catholicos armenian church sent caesarea consecrated upon return gregory tore shrines idols built churches monasteries ordained many priests bishops meditating capital city vagharshapat gregory vision christ descending earth striking hammer spot arose great christian temple huge cross convinced intended build main armenian church kings help accord vision renamed city etchmiadzin means place descent onlybegotten12
initially armenian church participated larger church world catholicos represented first council nicea king papas appointed catholicos husik without first sending caesarea commissioning rome plans roman universal church13 catholicos still represented first council constantinople
christianity strengthened armenia century translation bible armenian language native theologian monk scholar mesrob mashtots century armenians spoken language written thus bible liturgy written greek syriac rather armenian catholicos sahak commissioned mesrob create armenian alphabet completed subsequently bible liturgy translated armenian written script translation bible along translation works history literature philosophy caused flowering armenian literature broader cultural renaissance14

miaphysitism versus monophysitismedit
like oriental orthodox churches armenian church referred monophysite roman catholic eastern orthodox theologians rejected decisions council chalcedon condemned belief incarnate nature christ monophysis armenian church officially severed ties rome constantinople second council dvin chalcedonian dyophysite christological formula rejectedcitation needed
however like oriental orthodox churches18 armenian orthodox church argues identification monophysitism incorrect description position19 considers monophysitism taught eutyches condemned chalcedon heresy disagrees formula defined council chalcedon19 armenian church instead adheres doctrine defined cyril alexandria considered saint chalcedonian churches well described christ incarnate nature divine human nature united miaphysis distinguish eutychian versions monophysitism position called miaphysitism whereas prefix mono greek μόνο means thus emphasising singular nature christ greek simply means unemphatically allows compound nature
recent times chalcedonian nonchalcedonian churches developed deeper understanding others positions recognizing substantial agreement maintaining respective theological language
