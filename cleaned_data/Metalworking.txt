metal required fire obtain work isaac asimov speculated gold first metal5 reasoning chemistry found nature nuggets pure gold words gold rare sometimes found nature metal metals sometimes occur natively result meteors almost metals found ores mineralbearing rock require heat process liberate metal another feature gold workable found meaning technology beyond stone hammer anvil work metal needed result golds properties malleability ductility earliest tools stone bone wood sinew sufficed work gold
unknown point connection heat liberation metals rock became clear rocks rich copper lead came demand ores mined wherever recognized remnants ancient mines found southwestern asia6 metalworking carried south asian inhabitants mehrgarh 7000–3300 bce7 beginning metalworking occurs sometime around 6000 copper smelting became common southwestern asia
ancient civilisations knew seven metals arranged order oxidation potential volts

general processesedit




combination square used transferring designs






caliper used precisely measure short length


metalworking generally divided following categories forming cutting joining categories contain various processes
prior operations metal must marked andor measured depending desired finished product
marking also known layout process transferring design pattern workpiece first step handcraft metalworking performed many industries hobbies although industry repetition eliminates need mark every individual piece metal trades area marking consists transferring engineers plan workpiece preparation next step machining manufacture
calipers hand tools designed precisely measure distance points calipers sets flat parallel edges used inner outer diameter measurements calipers accurate within onethousandth inch different types calipers different mechanisms displaying distance measured larger objects need measured less precision tape measure often used
