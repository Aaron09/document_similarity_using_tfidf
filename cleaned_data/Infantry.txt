ranged combat weapons javelins slings blowguns bows crossbows hand cannons arquebuses muskets grenades flamethrowers17
close combat weapons bludgeoning weapons like clubs flails maces bladed weapons like swords daggers axes pole weapons like spears halberds naginata pikes17
ranged close weapons bayonet fixed firearm allows infantrymen weapon ranged combat close combat started muskets continued rifles automatic firearms17 bayonet declined modern automatic firearms still generally kept weapon last resort18

infantrymen often carry secondary backup weapons sometimes called sidearm ancillary weapons modern terminology either issued officially addition soldiers standard arms acquired unofficially means individual preference weapons used primary weapon longer effective becoming damaged running ammunition malfunction change tactical situation another weapon preferred going ranged close combat infantry ranged pole weapons often carried sword dagger possible handtohand combat16 pilum javelin roman legionaries threw drawing primary weapon gladius short sword closing enemy line19
modern infantrymen treat bayonet backup weapon also handguns pistols also deploy antipersonnel mines booby traps incendiary explosive devices defensively combat
