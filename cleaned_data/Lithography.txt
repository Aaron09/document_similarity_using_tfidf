lithography ancient greek λίθος lithos meaning stone γράφειν graphein meaning write method printing originally based immiscibility water1 printing stone lithographic limestone metal plate ball grained surface invented 1796 german author actor alois senefelder cheap method publishing theatrical works23 lithography used print text artwork onto paper suitable material4
lithography originally used image drawn onto surface smooth level lithographic limestone plate stone treated mixture acid arabic etching grease content drawing material pores stone chemically creating grease reservoirs open stone without drawing affected arabic creating thin layer would attract water stone subsequently moistened gummed areas retained water oilbased could applied roller sticking original drawing would finally transferred cotton fine paper sheet producing printed page traditional technique still used fine medium today
modern lithography image made polymer coating applied flexible plastic metal plate5 image printed directly plate orientation image reversed offset transferring image onto flexible sheet rubber printing publication
printing technology lithography different intaglio printing gravure wherein plate either engraved etched stippled score cavities contain printing woodblock printing letterpress printing wherein applied raised surfaces letters images today types highvolume books magazines especially illustrated colour printed offset lithography become common form printing technology since 1960s
related term photolithography refers photographic images used lithographic printing whether images printed directly stone metal plate offset printing photolithography used synonymously offset printing technique well term introduced europe 1850s beginning 1960s photolithography played important role fabrication mass production integrated circuits microelectronics industry67

19thcentury lithograph abraham salm


lithography uses simple chemical processes create image instance positive part image waterrepelling hydrophobic substance negative image would waterretaining hydrophilic thus plate introduced compatible printing water mixture adhere positive image etched mixture arabic acid subsequently replaced asphaltum stabilizing drawing allows flat print plate stone used enabling much longer detailed print runs older physical methods printing intaglio printing letterpress printing
lithography invented alois senefelder kingdom bavaria 1796 early days lithography much like fine lithography today smooth piece limestone used oilbased image surface solution arabic water applied sticking nonoily surface printing water adhered arabic surfaces repelled oily parts oily used printing opposite

arabic nonimage surfaces solution penetrates pores stone completely surrounding original image hydrophilic layer accept printing using lithographic turpentine printer removes excess greasy drawing material hydrophobic molecular film remains tightly bonded surface stone rejecting arabic water ready accept oily ink8
printing stone kept water naturally water attracted layer salt created acid wash printing based drying oils linseed varnish loaded pigment rolled surface water repels greasy hydrophobic areas left original drawing material accept hydrophobic image loaded stone paper press applies even pressure surface transferring paper stone
senefelder experimented early 19th century multicolor lithography 1819 book predicted process would eventually perfected used reproduce paintings2 multicolor printing introduced process developed godefroy engelmann france 1837 known chromolithography2 separate stone used color print went press separately stone main challenge keep images aligned register method lent images consisting large areas flat color resulted characteristic poster designs period

microlithography nanolithography refer specifically lithographic patterning methods capable structuring material fine scale typically features smaller micrometers considered microlithographic features smaller nanometers considered nanolithographic photolithography methods often applied semiconductor manufacturing microchips photolithography also commonly used fabricating microelectromechanical systems mems devices photolithography generally uses prefabricated photomask reticle master final pattern derived
although photolithographic technology commercially advanced form nanolithography techniques also used example electron beam lithography capable much greater patterning resolution sometimes small nanometers electron beam lithography also important commercially primarily manufacture photomasks electron beam lithography usually practiced form maskless lithography mask required generate final pattern instead final pattern created directly digital representation computer controlling electron beam scans across resistcoated substrate electron beam lithography disadvantage much slower photolithography
