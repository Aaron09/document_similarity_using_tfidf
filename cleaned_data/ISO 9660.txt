historyedit
9660 traces roots high sierra format file system2 high sierra arranged file information dense sequential layout minimize nonsequential access using hierarchical eight levels directories deep tree file system arrangement similar unix facilitate cross platform compatibility defined minimal common file attributes directory ordinary file time recording name attributes name extension version used separate system area future optional extensions file specified
high sierra adopted december 1986 changes international standard ecma international ecma1193 submitted fast tracking eventually accepted 966019884

volume descriptor terminator


9660 compliant disk contains least primary volume descriptor describing file system volume descriptor terminator indicating descriptor sequence
primary volume descriptor provides information volume characteristics metadata including root directory record indicates sector root directory located fields contain description name volume information created application size logical blocks file system uses segment volume also stored field inside primary volume descriptor well amount space occupied volume measured number logical blocks
addition primary volume descriptors supplementary volume descriptors enhanced volume descriptors present
supplementary volume descriptors describe volume primary volume descriptor normally used providing additional code page support standard code tables insufficient standard specifies 2022 used managing code sets wider bytes 2375 escape sequences used identify particular code page used consequently 9660 supports international singlebyte multibyte character sets provided framework referenced standards however 9660 specify code pages guaranteed supported code tables defined standard subject agreement originator recipient volume
enhanced volume descriptors introduced 9660 amendment relax requirements volume descriptors directory records referenced example directory depth exceed eight file identifiers need contain file version number length file directory identifier maximized

directories filesedit




overview 9660 directory structure


directory entries stored following location root directory entry evaluation filenames begun directories files stored extents sequential series sectors
files directories differentiated file attribute indicates nature similar unix attributes file stored directory entry describes file optionally extended attribute record
locate file directory names files path checked sequentially going location directory obtain location subsequent subdirectory however file also located path table provided file system path table stores information directory parent location disk since path table stored contiguous region searched much faster jumping particular locations directory files path thus reducing seek time
standard specifies three nested levels interchange paraphrased section

level file names limited eight characters threecharacter extension directory names limited eight characters files contain single file section
level files contain single file section
level additional restrictions stipulated main body standard directory identifiers exceed characters length file name file name extension exceed characters length sections files also allowed consist multiple noncontiguous sections restrictions order

additional restrictions body standard depth directory hierarchy must exceed root directory level path length file must exceed section 6821
standard also specifies following name restrictions sections

levels restrict file names mandatory file hierarchy upper case letters digits underscores also section annex
characters specified file name file name extension shall consist least character
characters specified file name extension file name shall consist least character
file names shall
directory names shall dots

authoring applications allow user almost character strictly speaking conform 9660 standard operating systems read 9660 file systems problem outofspec names however names could appear wrong user
path tablesedit
path tables summarize directory structure relevant directory hierarchy providing directory identifier location extent directory recorded length extended attributes associated directory index parent directory path table entry
limitationsedit
directory depth limitedit
restrictions filename length characters plus character extension interchange level directory depth levels including root directory6 serious limitation 9660 file system
rock ridge extension works around eightdirectory depth limit folding paths practice however drivers oses care directory depth rule often ignored
addition restrictions mentioned cdrom producer choose lower levels interchange specified chapter standard restrict file name length characters file identifiers directory identifiers order promote interchangeability implementations implement full standard sometimes mistakenly interpreted restriction 9660 standard
file size limitedit
numbers 9660 file systems except single byte value used offset unsigned numbers length files extent disk stored value7 allows maximum length precisely byte less note older operating systems handle values incorrectly signed instead unsigned would make impossible access files larger size latter holds true also operating systems without large file support
based often assumed file 9660 formatted disc cannot larger 2321 size files size stored unsigned value 2321 maximum
however possible circumvent limitation using multiextent fragmentation feature 9660 level create 9660 filesystems single files files larger split multiple extents sequential series sectors exceeding limit example free software infrarecorder imgburn mkisofs well roxio toast able create 9660 filesystems multiextent files store files larger appropriate media recordable dvds
empirical tests fragmented file media shown microsoft windows supports 1048 handle case properly case driver appears support file fragmentation supports 9660 level level linux supports multiple extents8 freebsd shows reads last extent multiextent filecitation neededoriginal research
limit number directoriesedit
another limitation less well known number directories image structure called path table directory image path table provides number parent directory entry problem parent directory number 16bit number limiting range 655359 content directory written also different place making path table redundant suitable fast searching
operating systems windows path table others linux image disk consists 65535 directories readable linux early windows versions files additional directories visible show empty zero length current windowswhen versions appear handle correctly
software tools problems managing path table directory limit exceeded popular application using format mkisofs aborts path table overflow nero burning windows pinnacle instant cddvd check whether problem occurs produce invalid file disk without warning tool isovfy cannot easily report problem
extensions improvementsedit
several extensions 9660 relax limitations

rock ridge supports preservation posix unixstyle permissions longer names
joliet supports unicode names stored ucs2 thus allowing almost character used even nonlatin scripts
torito enables bootable
apple 9660 extensions adds support classic osspecific macosspecific file characteristics resource forks file backup date

operating systems support extensions name translation file transtbl must used located every directory including root directory obsolete since operating systems today
13490 standard extension 9660 format adds support multiple sessions disc since 9660 design readonly premastered file system data written session medium written provision altering stored content 13490 created allow adding files writeable disc multiple sessions
13346ecma16710 standard designed conjunction 13490 standard address shortcomings 966011 subset evolved format adopted dvds
06061998 also known 96601999 japanese industrial standard draft created japanese national body jtc1 n4222 order make improvements remove limitations original 9660 standard12 draft submitted 1998 ratified standard changes includes removal restrictions imposed original standard extending maximum file name length characters removing eightlevel maximum directory nesting limit removing special meaning character filenames operating systems allow relaxations well reading optical discs several disc authoring tools nero burning mkisofs imgburn support socalled 96601999 mode sometimes called 9660 9660 level mode removes restrictions following guidelines 96601999 draft
disc imagesedit
