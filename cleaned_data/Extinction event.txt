despite popularization five events definite line separating extinction events using different methods calculating extinctions impact lead events featuring five16
older fossil record gets difficult read

older fossils harder find usually buried considerable depth
dating older fossils difficult
productive fossil beds researched unproductive ones therefore leaving certain periods unresearched
prehistoric environmental events disturb deposition process
preservation fossils varies land marine fossils tend better preserved sought landbased counterparts17

suggested apparent variations marine biodiversity actually artifact abundance estimates directly related quantity rock available sampling different time periods18 however statistical analysis shows account observed patterncitation needed evidence fungal spikesclarification needed provides reassurance widely accepted extinction events real quantification rock exposure western europe indicates many minor events biological explanation sought readily explained sampling bias19

mass extinctions sometimes accelerated evolution life earth dominance particular ecological niches passes group organisms another rarely dominant group superior usually extinction event eliminates dominant group makes one4849
example mammaliformes almost mammals mammals existed throughout reign dinosaurs could compete large terrestrial vertebrate niches dinosaurs monopolized endcretaceous mass extinction removed nonavian dinosaurs made possible mammals expand large terrestrial vertebrate niches ironically dinosaurs beneficiaries previous mass extinction endtriassic eliminated chief rivals crurotarsans
another point view forward escalation hypothesis predicts species ecological niches organismtoorganism conflict less likely survive extinctions traits keep species numerous viable fairly static conditions become burden population levels fall among competing organisms dynamics extinction event
furthermore many groups survive mass extinctions recover numbers diversity many longterm decline often referred dead clades walking50
darwin firmly opinion biotic interactions competition food space—the ‘struggle existence’—were considerably greater importance promoting evolution extinction changes physical environment expressed origin species species produced exterminated slowly acting causes…and import causes organic change almost independent altered…physical conditions namely mutual relation organism organismthe improvement organism entailing improvement extermination others51

phanerozoic biodiversity shown fossil record


mass extinctions thought result longterm stress compounded short term shock62 course phanerozoic individual taxa appear less likely become extinct time63 reflect robust food webs well less extinctionprone species factors continental distribution63 however even accounting sampling bias appear gradual decrease extinction origination rates phanerozoic5 represent fact groups higher turnover rates likely become extinct chance artefact taxonomy families tend become speciose therefore less prone extinction time5 larger taxonomic groups definition appear earlier geological time64
also suggested oceans gradually become hospitable life last million years thus less vulnerable mass extinctionsnote 16566 susceptibility extinction taxonomic level appear make mass extinctions less probable63
causesedit
still debate causes mass extinctions general large extinctions result biosphere longterm stress undergoes shortterm shock62 underlying mechanism appears present correlation extinction origination rates diversity high diversity leads persistent increase extinction rate diversity persistent increase origination rate presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely amplify smaller perturbations asteroid impacts produce global effects observed5
identifying causes particular mass extinctionsedit
good theory particular mass extinction explain losses focus groups dinosaurs explain particular groups organisms died others survived provide mechanisms strong enough cause mass extinction total extinction based events processes shown happened inferred extinction
necessary consider combinations causes example marine aspect endcretaceous extinction appears caused several processes partially overlapped time different levels significance different parts world67
arens west 2006 proposed press pulse model mass extinctions generally require types cause longterm pressure ecosystem press sudden catastrophe pulse towards period pressure68 statistical analysis marine extinction rates throughout phanerozoic suggested neither longterm pressure alone catastrophe alone sufficient cause significant increase extinction rate
widely supported explanationsedit
macleod 200169 summarized relationship mass extinctions events often cited causes mass extinctions using data courtillot 199670 hallam 199271 grieve 199672

flood basalt events occurrences associated significant extinctions7374 wignall 2001 concluded five major extinctions coincided flood basalt eruptions main phase extinctions started eruptions75
sealevel falls seven associated significant extinctions74
asteroid impacts large impact associated mass extinction cretaceous–paleogene extinction event many smaller impacts associated significant extinctionscitation needed

commonly suggested causes mass extinctions listed
flood basalt eventsedit
formation large igneous provinces flood basalt events could

produced dust particulate aerosols inhibited photosynthesis thus caused food chains collapse land sea76
emitted sulfur oxides precipitated acid rain poisoned many organisms contributing collapse food chains
emitted carbon dioxide thus possibly causing sustained global warming dust particulate aerosols dissipated

flood basalt events occur pulses activity punctuated dormant periods result likely cause climate oscillate cooling warming overall trend towards warming carbon dioxide emit stay atmosphere hundreds years
speculated massive volcanism caused contributed endpermian endtriassic endcretaceous extinctions77 correlation gigantic volcanic events expressed large igneous provinces mass extinctions shown last myr7879 recently possible correlation extended whole phanerozoic eon80
sealevel fallsedit
often clearly marked worldwide sequences contemporaneous sediments show part transition seabed tidal zone beach land evidence rocks relevant areas raised geological processes orogeny sealevel falls could reduce continental shelf area productive part oceans sufficiently cause marine mass extinction could disrupt weather patterns enough cause extinctions land sealevel falls probably result events sustained global cooling sinking midocean ridges
sealevel falls associated mass extinctions including five—endordovician late devonian endpermian endtriassic endcretaceous
study published journal nature online june 2008 established relationship speed mass extinction events changes level sediment81 study suggests changes ocean environments related level exert driving influence rates extinction generally determine composition life oceans82
impact eventsedit
impact sufficiently large asteroid comet could caused food chains collapse land producing dust particulate aerosols thus inhibiting photosynthesis83 impacts sulfurrich rocks could emitted sulfur oxides precipitating poisonous acid rain contributing collapse food chains impacts could also caused megatsunamis andor global forest fires
paleontologists agree asteroid earth ongoing dispute whether impact sole cause cretaceous–paleogene extinction event8485
sustained significant global coolingedit
sustained global cooling could kill many polar temperate species force others migrate towards equator reduce area available tropical species often make earths climate arid average mainly locking planets water snow glaciation cycles current believed mild impact biodiversity mere existence significant cooling sufficient explain mass extinction
suggested global cooling caused contributed endordovician permian–triassic late devonian extinctions possibly others sustained global cooling distinguished temporary climatic effects flood basalt events impacts
sustained significant global warmingedit
would opposite effects expand area available tropical species kill temperate species force migrate towards poles possibly cause severe extinctions polar species often make earths climate wetter average mainly melting snow thus increasing volume water cycle might also cause anoxic events oceans
global warming cause mass extinction supported several recent studies86
dramatic example sustained warming paleocene–eocene thermal maximum associated smaller mass extinctions also suggested caused triassic–jurassic extinction event marine families became extinct furthermore permian–triassic extinction event suggested caused warming878889
clathrate hypothesisedit
main article clathrate hypothesis
clathrates composites lattice substance forms cage around another methane clathrates water molecules cage form continental shelves clathrates likely break rapidly release methane temperature rises quickly pressure drops quickly—for example response sudden global warming sudden drop level even earthquakes methane much powerful greenhouse carbon dioxide methane eruption clathrate could cause rapid global warming make much severe eruption caused global warming
likely signature methane eruption would sudden decrease ratio carbon13 carbon12 sediments since methane clathrates carbon13 change would large events also reduce percentage carbon1390
suggested clathrate methane eruptions involved endpermian extinction great dying paleocene–eocene thermal maximum associated smaller mass extinctions
anoxic eventsedit
anoxic events situations middle even upper layers ocean become deficient totally lacking oxygen causes complex controversial known instances associated severe sustained global warming mostly caused sustained massive volcanism91
suggested anoxic events caused contributed ordovician–silurian late devonian permian–triassic triassic–jurassic extinctions well number lesser extinctions ireviken mulde toarcian cenomanian–turonian events hand widespread black shale beds midcretaceous indicate anoxic events associated mass extinctions
bioavailability essential trace elements particular selenium potentially lethal lows shown coincide likely contributed least three mass extinction events oceans ordovician middle late devonian triassic periods oxygen concentrations soluble selenate converted much less soluble selenide elemental organoselenium complexes bioavailability selenium extinction events dropped current oceanic concentration level proven lethal many extant organisms92
hydrogen sulfide emissions seasedit
kump pavlov arthur 2005 proposed permian–triassic extinction event warming also upset oceanic balance photosynthesising plankton deepwater sulfatereducing bacteria causing massive emissions hydrogen sulfide poisoned life land severely weakened ozone layer exposing much life still remained fatal levels radiation939495
oceanic overturnedit
oceanic overturn disruption thermohaline circulation lets surface water saline deep water evaporation sink straight bringing anoxic deep water surface therefore killing oxygenbreathing organisms inhabit surface middle depths occur either beginning glaciation although overturn start glaciation dangerous preceding warm period created larger volume anoxic water96
unlike oceanic catastrophes regressions sealevel falls anoxic events overturns leave easily identified signatures rocks theoretical consequences researchers conclusions climatic marine events
suggested oceanic overturn caused contributed late devonian permian–triassic extinctions
nearby nova supernova gamma burstedit
nearby gammaray burst less 6000 lightyears away would powerful enough destroy earths ozone layer leaving organisms vulnerable ultraviolet radiation sun97 gamma bursts fairly rare occurring times given galaxy million years98 suggested supernova gamma burst caused endordovician extinction99
geomagnetic reversaledit
theory periods increased geomagnetic reversals weaken earths magnetic field long enough expose atmosphere solar winds causing oxygen ions escape atmosphere rate increased orders resulting disastrous decrease oxygen100
plate tectonicsedit
movement continents configurations cause contribute extinctions several ways initiating ending ages changing ocean wind currents thus altering climate opening seaways land bridges expose previously isolated species competition poorly adapted example extinction south americas native ungulates large metatherians creation land bridge north south america occasionally continental drift creates supercontinent includes vast majority earths land area addition effects listed likely reduce total area continental shelf speciesrich part ocean produce vast arid continental interior extreme seasonal variations
another theory creation supercontinent pangaea contributed endpermian mass extinction pangaea almost fully formed transition midpermian latepermian marine genus diversity diagram article shows level extinction starting time might qualified inclusion five overshadowed great dying permian101
hypothesesedit
many hypotheses proposed spread disease simple outcompetition following especially successful biological innovation rejected usually following reasons require events processes evidence assume mechanisms contrary available evidence based theories rejected superseded
scientists concerned human activities could cause plants animals become extinct point past along humanmade changes climate extinctions could caused overhunting overfishing invasive species habitat loss study published 2017 proceedings national academy sciences argued “biological annihilation” akin sixth mass extinction event underway result anthropogenic causes overpopulation overconsumption study suggested much number animal individuals lived earth already extinct threatening basis human existence too10224
future biosphere extinctionedit
also future earth fermi paradox
eventual warming expanding combined eventual decline atmospheric carbon dioxide could actually cause even greater mass extinction potential wipe even microbes rising global temperatures caused expanding gradually increase rate weathering turn removes carbon dioxide atmosphere carbon dioxide levels perhaps plant life although simpler plants like grasses mosses survive much longer levels drop ppm103104
photosynthetic organisms gone atmospheric oxygen longer replenished eventually removed chemical reactions atmosphere perhaps volcanic eruptions eventually loss oxygen cause remaining aerobic life asphyxiation leaving behind simple anaerobic prokaryotes becomes brighter billion years103 earth suffer moist greenhouse effect resulting oceans boiling away earths liquid outer core cools inner cores expansion causes earths magnetic field shut absence magnetic field charged particles deplete atmosphere increase earths temperature average billion years causing last remaining life earth extreme instance climatecaused extinction event since happen late suns life cause final mass extinction earths history albeit long extinction event103104
effects recoveryedit
impact mass extinction events varied widely major extinction event usually weedy species survive ability live diverse habitats105 later species diversify occupy empty niches generally biodiversity recovers million years extinction event severe mass extinctions take million years105
worst event permian–triassic extinction event devastated life earth estimated killed species life seemed recover quickly extinction mostly form disaster taxa hardy lystrosaurus recent research indicates specialized animals formed complex ecosystems high biodiversity complex food webs variety niches took much longer recover thought long recovery successive waves extinction inhibited recovery well prolonged environmental stress organisms continued early triassic recent research indicates recovery begin start midtriassic years extinction106 writers estimate recovery complete years extinction late triassic107 subsequent extinction increase provincialization species occupying smaller ranges perhaps removing incumbents niches setting stage eventual rediversification108
effects mass extinctions plants somewhat harder quantify given biases inherent plant fossil record mass extinctions endpermian equally catastrophic plants whereas others enddevonian affect flora109
