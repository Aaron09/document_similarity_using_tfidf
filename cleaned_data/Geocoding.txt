historyedit
geocoding subset geographic information system spatial analysis subject interest since early 1960s
1960sedit
1960 first operational named canada geographic information system cgis invented roger tomlinson since acknowledged father cgis used store analyze data collected canada land inventory mapped information agriculture wildlife forestry scale 150000 order regulate land capability rural canada however cgis lasted 1990s never available commercially
july 1963 fivedigit codes introduced nationwide united states post office department uspod 1983 ninedigit zip4 codes brought extra identifier accurately locating addresses
1964 harvard laboratory computer graphics spatial analysis developed groundbreaking software code grid symap sources commercial development
1967 team census bureau including mathematician james corbett donald cooke2 invented dual independent encoding dime first modern vector mapping model ciphered address ranges street network files incorporated percent along geocoding algorithm3 still platforms google maps mapquest percent along algorithm denotes matched address located along reference feature percentage reference features total length dime intended united states census bureau involved accurately mapping block faces digitizing nodes representing street intersections forming spatial relationships connecticut first city earth geocodable streets network database
1980sedit
late 1970s main public domain geocoding platforms development grass moss early 1980s rise many commercial vendors geocoding software namely intergraph esri caris erdas mapinfo corporation platforms merged 1960s approach separating spatial information approach organizing spatial information database structures
1986 mapping display analysis system midas became first desktop geocoding software designed operating system geocoding elevated research department business world acquisition midas mapinfo mapinfo since acquired pitney bowes pioneered merging geocoding business intelligence allowing location intelligence provide solutions public private sectors
1990sedit
20th century seen geocoding become useroriented especially opensource software mapping applications geospatial data become accessible internet
mailoutmailback technique successful 1980 census bureau census able together large geospatial database using interpolated street geocoding4 database along census’ nationwide coverage households allowed birth tiger topologically integrated geographic encoding referencing
containing address ranges instead individual addresses tiger since implemented nearly geocoding software platforms used today 1990 census tiger contained latitudelongitudecoordinate million feature intersections endpoints nearly million feature ‘shape’ points defined million feature segments outlined million polygons5
tiger breakthrough data geospatial solutions
2000sedit
early 2000s rise coding accuracy support system cass address standardization cass certification offered software vendors advertising mailers want united states postal services usps assess quality addressstandardizing software annually renewed cass certification based delivery point codes codes zip4 codes adoption cass certified software software vendors allows receive discounts bulk mailing shipping costs benefit increased accuracy efficiency bulk mailings certified database early 2000s geocoding platforms also able support multiple datasets
2003 geocoding platforms capable merging postal codes street data updated monthly process became known conflation
beginning 2005 geocoding platforms included parcelcentroid geocoding parcelcentroid geocoding allowed precision geocoding address example parcelcentroid allowed geocoder determine centroid specific building land platforms also able determine elevation specific parcels
2005 also introduction assessors parcel number jurisdictions assessor able assign number parcels real estate allowed proper identification recordkeeping important geocoding area covered lease indexing property information provided public
2006 reverse geocoding reverse lookup introduced geocoding platforms involved geocoding numerical point location longitude latitude textual readable address
2008 2009 growth interactive useroriented geocoding platforms namely mapquest google maps bing maps global positioning systems platforms made even accessible public simultaneous growth mobile industry specifically smartphones
2010sedit
current decade seen vendors fully supporting geocoding reverse geocoding globally cloudbased geocoding application programming interface onpremise geocoding allowed greater match rate greater precision greater speed popularity idea geocoding able influence business decisions integration geocoding process business intelligence
future geocoding also involves threedimensional geocoding indoor geocoding multiple language returns geocoding platforms
geocoding processedit
geocoding task involves multiple datasets processes work together geocoder made important components reference dataset geocoding algorithm components made suboperations subcomponents without understanding geocoding processes work difficult make informed business decisions based geocoding
input dataedit
input data descriptive textual information address building name user wants turn numerical spatial data latitude longitude process geocoding
classification input dataedit
input data classified categories relative input data absolute input data
relative input dataedit
relative input data textual descriptions location alone cannot output spatial representation location data outputs relative geocode dependent geographically relative reference locations example relative geocode addressinterpolation using areal units line vectors across street empire state building example relative input data location sought cannot determined without identifying empire state building geocoding platforms often support relative locations advances made direction
absolute input dataedit
absolute input data textual descriptions location alone output spatial representation location data type outputs absolute known location independently locations example usps codes usps zip4 codes complete partial postal addresses usps boxes rural routes cities counties intersections named places referenced data source absolutely
variability addresses represented much input data little input data geocoders address normalization address standardization order resolve problem
processing input dataedit
address interpolationedit
simple method geocoding address interpolation method makes data street geographic information system street network already mapped within geographic coordinate space street segment attributed address ranges house numbers segment next geocoding takes address matches street specific segment block towns block convention geocoding interpolates position address within range along segment
exampleedit
take example evergreen terrace
lets segment instance block evergreen terrace runs evennumbered addresses fall east side evergreen terrace oddnumbered addresses west side street evergreen terrace would probably located slightly less halfway block east side street point would mapped location along street perhaps offset distance east street centerline

however process always straightforward example difficulties arise

distinguishing ambiguous addresses evergreen terrace evergreen terrace
attempting geocode addresses street added geographic information system database

might evergreen terrace springfield might also evergreen terrace shelbyville asking city name state province country needed solve problem boston massachusetts6 multiple washington street locations several cities annexed without changing street names thus requiring unique postal codes district names disambiguation geocoding accuracy greatly improved first utilizing good address verification practices address verification confirm existence address eliminate ambiguities valid address determined easy geocode determine latitudelongitude coordinates finally several caveats using interpolation

typical attribution street segment assumes even numbered parcels side segment numbered parcels often true real life
interpolation assumes given parcels evenly distributed along length segment almost never true real life uncommon geocoded address several thousand feet
interpolation also assumes street straight street curved geocoded location necessarily physical location address
segment information sources tiger includes maximum upper bound addresses interpolated though full address range used example segment block might listed range 100199 last address block case address would geocoded distance segment rather near
interpolation implementations produce point resulting address location reality physical address distributed along length segment consider geocoding address shopping mall physical distance along street segment could thought twodimensional spacefilling polygon front several different streets worse cities multilevel streets threedimensional shape meets different streets several different levels interpolation treats singularity

common error believe accuracy ratings given maps geocodable attributes accuracy currently touted vendors bearing address attributed correct segment attributed correct side segment resulting accurate position along correct segment geocoding process used census tiger datasets addresses allocated different census tract study australias tigerlike system found geocoded points mapped wrong property parcel7 accuracy geocoded data also bearing quality research done using data study8 group iowa researchers found common method geocoding using tiger datasets described cause loss much power statistical analysis alternative orthophoto image coded data address point data ordnance survey datasets generally expensive quite important avoid using interpolated results except noncritical applications interpolated geocoding usually appropriate making authoritative decisions example life safety affected decision emergency services example make authoritative decision based interpolations ambulance fire truck always dispatched regardless sayscitation needed
techniquesedit
rural areas places lacking high quality street network data addressing useful mapping location traffic accidents geocoding street intersection midpoint along street centerline suitable technique highways developed countries mile markers emergency response maintenance navigation also possible combination geocoding techniques using particular technique certain cases situations techniques cases contrast geocoding structured postal address records toponym resolution maps place names unstructured document collections corresponding spatial footprints
