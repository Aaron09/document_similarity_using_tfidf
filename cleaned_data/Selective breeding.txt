selective breeding also called artificial selection process humans animal breeding plant breeding selectively develop particular phenotypic traits characteristics choosing typically animal plant males females sexually reproduce offspring together domesticated animals known breeds normally bred professional breeder domesticated plants known varieties cultigens cultivars purebred animals different breeds produce crossbreed crossbred plants called hybrids flowers vegetables fruittrees bred amateurs commercial noncommercial professionals major crops usually provenance professionals
approaches types artificial selection selective breeding first traditional breeders approach breeder experimenter applies known amount selection single phenotypic trait examining chosen trait choosing breed exhibit higher extreme values trait second called controlled natural selection essentially natural selection controlled environment breeder choose individuals tested survive reproduce could traditional approach also selection experiments third approach conducted order determine strength natural selection wild however often observational approach opposed experimental approach1
animal breeding techniques inbreeding linebreeding outcrossing utilized plant breeding similar methods used charles darwin discussed selective breeding successful producing change time 1859 book origin species first chapter discusses selective breeding domestication animals pigeons cats cattle dogs darwin used artificial selection springboard introduce support theory natural selection2

selective breeding unintentional resulting process human cultivation also produce unintended desirable undesirable results example grains increase seed size resulted certain ploughing practices rather intentional selection larger seeds likely interdependence natural artificial factors resulted plant domestication3

historyedit
selective breeding plants animals practiced since early prehistory species wheat rice dogs significantly different wild ancestors millennia maize required especially large changes teosinte wild form selectively bred mesoamerica selective breeding practiced romans4 treatises much 2000 years give advice selecting animals different purposes ancient works cite still older authorities mago carthaginian5 notion selective breeding later expressed persian muslim polymath rayhan biruni 11th century noted idea book titled india included various examples6

agriculturist selects corn letting grow much requires tearing remainder forester leaves branches perceives excellent whilst cuts away others bees kill kind work beehive
rayhan biruni india

selective breeding established scientific practice robert bakewell british agricultural revolution 18th century arguably important breeding program sheep using native stock able quickly select large fineboned sheep long lustrous wool lincoln longwool improved bakewell turn lincoln used develop subsequent breed named dishley leicester hornless square meaty body straight lines7
sheep exported widely including australia north america contributed numerous modern breeds despite fact fell quickly favor market preferences meat textiles changed bloodlines original leicesters survive today english leicester leicester longwool primarily kept wool production
bakewell also first breed cattle used primarily beef previously cattle first foremost kept pulling ploughs oxencitation needed crossed longhorned heifers westmoreland bull eventually create dishley longhorn farmers followed lead farm animals increased dramatically size quality 1700 average weight bull sold slaughter pounds 1786 weight doubled pounds however death dishley longhorn replaced shorthorn versions
also bred improved black cart horse later became shire horse
charles darwin coined term selective breeding interested process illustration proposed wider process natural selection darwin noted many domesticated animals plants special properties developed intentional animal plant breeding individuals showed desirable characteristics discouraging breeding individuals less desirable characteristics
darwin used term artificial selection twice 1859 first edition work origin species chapter natural selection chapter difficulties theory

slow though process selection feeble much powers artificial selection limit amount change beauty infinite complexity coadaptations organic beings another physical conditions life effected long course time natures power selection8
charles darwin origin species


profoundly ignorant causes producing slight unimportant variations immediately made conscious reflecting differences breeds domesticated animals different countries—more especially less civilized countries little artificial selection9

selective breeding aquacultureedit
selective breeding aquaculture holds high potential genetic improvement fish shellfish unlike terrestrial livestock potential benefits selective breeding aquaculture realized recently high mortality selection broodstock causing inbreeding depression forced wild broodstock evident selective breeding programs growth rate resulted slow growth high mortality15

quality traits aquacultureedit
aquaculture species reared particular traits growth rate survival rate meat quality resistance diseases sexual maturation fecundity shell traits like shell size shell colour

growth rate growth rate normally measured either body weight body length trait great economic importance aquaculture species faster growth rate speeds turnover production17 improved growth rates show farmed animals utilize feed efficiently correlated response16
survival rate survival rate take account degrees resistance diseases16 also stress response fish stress highly vulnerable diseases17 stress fish experience could biological chemical environmental influence
meat quality quality fish great economic importance market fish quality usually takes account size meatiness percentage colour flesh taste shape body ideal omega3 content16
sexual maturation maturity aquaculture species another important attribute farmers early maturation species divert energy gonad production affecting growth meat production susceptible health problems gjerde 1986
fecundity fecundity fish shellfish usually high considered major trait improvement however selective breeding practices consider size correlate survival early growth rate16

aquatic species versus terrestrial livestockedit
selective breeding programs aquatic species provide better outcomes compared terrestrial livestock higher response selection aquatic farmed species attributed following

high fecundity sexes fish shellfish enabling higher selection intensity
large phenotypic genetic variation selected traits

selective breeding aquaculture provide remarkable economic benefits industry primary reduces production costs faster turnover rates faster growth rates decreased maintenance rates increased energy protein retention better feed efficiency15 applying genetic improvement program aquaculture species increase productivity meet increasing demands growing populations
advantages disadvantagesedit
selective breeding direct determine specific trait evolve response selection singlegeneration method breeding accurate direct process also practical easier understand sibling analysis selective breeding better traits physiology behavior hard measure requires fewer individuals test singlegeneration testing
however disadvantages process single experiment done selective breeding cannot used assess entire group genetic variances individual experiments must done every individual trait also necessity selective breeding experiments require maintaining organisms tested greenhouse impractical breeding method many organisms controlled mating instances difficult carry case necessary component selective breeding1
