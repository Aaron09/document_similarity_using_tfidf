origin evolution lifeedit
creation–evolution controversy united states raises issue whether creationistic ideas legitimately called science whether evolution legitimately called science debate sides even courts decisions frequently invoked poppers criterion falsifiability daubert standard context passages written popper frequently quoted speaks issues example famously stated darwinism testable scientific theory metaphysical research program—a possible framework testable scientific theories continued

theory invaluable without knowledge could grown done since darwin trying explain experiments bacteria become adapted penicillin quite clear greatly helped theory natural selection although metaphysical sheds much light upon concrete practical researches allows study adaptation environment penicillininfested environment rational suggests existence mechanism adaptation allows even study detail mechanism work51

also noted theism presented explaining adaptation worse open admission failure created impression ultimate explanation reached52
popper later said

speaking darwinism shall speak always todays theory—that darwins theory natural selection supported mendelian theory heredity theory mutation recombination genes gene pool decoded genetic code immensely impressive powerful theory claim completely explains evolution course bold claim established scientific theories conjectures even successfully passed many severe varied tests mendelian underpinning modern darwinism well tested theory evolution says terrestrial life evolved primitive unicellular organisms possibly even single organism52

1974 regarding origin life said

makes origin life genetic code disturbing riddle genetic code without biological function unless translated unless leads synthesis proteins whose structure laid code monod points machinery cell least nonprimitive cell know translates code consists least fifty macromolecular components coded monod 197053 1971 14354
thus code translated except using certain products translation constitutes really baffling circle vicious circle seems attempt form model theory genesis genetic code
thus faced possibility origin life like origin universe becomes impenetrable barrier science residue attempts reduce biology chemistry physics55

explained difficulty testing people describe natural selection tautology past described theory almost tautological tried explain theory could untestable tautology great scientific interest

solution doctrine natural selection successful metaphysical research programme raises detailed problems many fields tells would expect acceptable solution problems still believe natural selection works research programme nevertheless changed mind testability logical status theory natural selection glad opportunity make recantation52

popper summarized view follows

theory natural selection formulated tautological case testable turns strictly universally true seem exceptions many biological theories considering random character variations natural selection operates occurrence exceptions surprising thus phenomena evolution explained natural selection alone every particular case challenging research program show natural selection possibly held responsible evolution particular organ behavioural program56

frequently quoted passages small part popper wrote issue evolution however give wrong impression mainly discussed questions falsifiability popper never invented criterion give justifiable words like science fact popper says beginning logic scientific discovery define science science fact defined quite arbitrarily
popper sophisticated views evolution57 much beyond frequentlyquoted passages say58 effect popper agreed points creationists naturalists also disagreed views crucial aspects popper understood universe creative entity invents things including life without necessity something like especially pulling strings behind curtain said evolution must creationists work goaldirected way59 disagreed view must necessarily hand imposes goals onto stage life
instead formulated spearhead model evolution version genetic pluralism according model living organisms goals according goals guided central control sophisticated form brain humans controls also exist much less sophisticated ways species lower complexity amoeba control organ plays special role evolution—it spearhead evolution goals bring purpose world mutations genes determine structure control cause drastic changes behaviour preferences goals without impact organisms phenotype popper postulates purely behavioural changes less likely lethal organism compared drastic changes phenotype60
popper contrasts views notion hopeful monster large phenotype mutations calls hopeful behavioural monster behaviour changed radically small quick changes phenotype follow make organism fitter changed goals looks phenotype changing guided invisible hand merely natural selection working combination behaviour example according hypothesis eating habits giraffe must changed elongated neck evolved popper contrasted view evolution within active darwinism organism actively trying discover ways life quest conquering ecological niches6162 naturalistic evolution without picture hostile environment trying kill mostly passive organism perhaps segregate groups
popper figure encouraging patent lawyer günter wächtershäuser publish iron–sulfur world theory abiogenesis criticism soup theory

popper john eccles speculated problem free many years generally agreeing interactionist dualist theory mind however although popper bodymind dualist think mind substance separate body thought mental psychological properties aspects people distinct physical ones64
gave second arthur holly compton memorial lecture 1965 popper revisited idea quantum indeterminacy source human freedom eccles suggested critically poised neurons might influenced mind assist decision popper criticised comptons idea amplified quantum events affecting decision wrote

idea alternative determinism sheer chance taken schlick together many views subject hume asserted removal called physical necessity must always result thing chance objects must either conjoind impossible admit medium betwixt chance absolute necessity


shall later argue important doctrine according alternative determinism sheer chance must admit doctrine seems hold good quantumtheoretical models designed explain least illustrate possibility human freedom seems reason models unsatisfactory65


humes schlicks ontological thesis cannot exist anything intermediate chance determinism seems highly dogmatic doctrinaire clearly absurd understandable assumption believed complete determinism chance status except symptom ignorance66

popper called something chance necessity combination randomness control explain freedom though explicitly stages random chance controlled decision saying freedom chance rather result subtle interplay something almost random haphazard something like restrictive selective control67
1977 book john eccles self brain popper finally formulates twostage model temporal sequence compares free darwinian evolution natural selection

ideas striking similarity genetic mutations look moment genetic mutations mutations seems brought quantum theoretical indeterminacy including radiation effects accordingly also probabilistic originally selected adequate subsequently operates natural selection eliminates inappropriate mutations could conceive similar process respect ideas freewill decisions similar things
