ontologyedit
general metaphysical question cause effect kind entity cause kind entity effect
viewpoint question cause effect kind entity causality asymmetric relation would make good sense grammatically either cause effect cause effect though actually true view opinion proposed metaphysical principle process philosophy every cause every effect respectively process event becoming happening6 example tripping step cause breaking ankle effect another view causes effects states affairs exact natures entities less restrictively defined process philosophy7
another viewpoint question classical cause effect different kinds entity example aristotles efficient causal explanation action cause enduring object effect example generative actions parents regarded efficient cause socrates effect socrates regarded enduring object philosophical tradition called substance distinct action
epistemologyedit
since causality subtle metaphysical notion considerable effort needed establish knowledge particular empirical circumstances
geometrical significanceedit
causality properties antecedence contiguity89 topological ingredients spacetime geometry developed alfred robb properties allow derivation notions time space10 jammer writes einstein postulate opens straightforward construction causal topology minkowski space11 causal efficacy propagates faster light12
thus notion causality metaphysically prior notions time space practical terms relation causality necessary interpretation empirical experiments interpretation experiments needed establish physical geometrical notions time space
necessary sufficient causesedit
similar concept occurs logic necessary sufficient conditions
causes sometimes distinguished types necessary sufficient13 third type causation requires neither necessity sufficiency contributes effect called contributory cause

necessary causes
necessary cause presence necessarily implies prior occurrence presence however imply occur14
sufficient causes
sufficient cause presence necessarily implies subsequent occurrence however another cause alternatively cause thus presence imply prior occurrence
contributory causes
specific effect singular case factor contributory cause amongst several cooccurrent causes implicit contributory specific effect general implication contributory cause necessary though general factor contributory cause sufficient definition accompanied causes would count causes sufficient specific effect factor occasions contributory cause might occasions sufficient occasions would merely contributory15

conditional statements statements causality important distinction statements causality require antecedent precede coincide consequent time whereas conditional statements require temporal order confusion commonly arises since many different statements english presented using form arguably form commonly used make statement causality types statements distinct however
example following statements true interpreting material conditional

barack obama president united states 2011 germany europe
george washington president united states 2011 arbitrary statement

first true since antecedent consequent true second true sentential logic indeterminate natural language regardless consequent statement follows antecedent false
ordinary indicative conditional somewhat structure material conditional instance although first closest neither preceding statements seems true ordinary indicative reading sentence

shakespeare stratfordonavon write macbeth someone else

intuitively seems true even though straightforward causal relation hypothetical situation shakespeares writing macbeth someone elses actually writing
another sort conditional counterfactual conditional stronger connection causality even counterfactual statements examples causality consider following statements

triangle would three sides
switch thrown bulb would light

first case would correct triangle caused three sides since relationship triangularity threesidedness definition property three sides actually determines state triangle nonetheless even interpreted counterfactually first statement true early version aristotles four cause theory described recognizing essential cause version theory closed polygon three sides said essential cause triangle17 word cause course obsolete nevertheless within scope ordinary language essential triangle three sides

material cause material whence thing come persists changes example ones mother bronze statue also substance theory69
formal cause whereby things dynamic form static shape determines things properties function human differs statue human statue differs lump bronze70
efficient cause imparts first relevant movement human lifts rock raises statue main topic present article
final cause criterion completion refer action inanimate process examples socrates takes walk dinner sake health earth falls lowest level nature

aristotles four kinds explanatory modes efficient cause cause defined leading paragraph present article three explanatory modes might rendered material composition structure dynamics criterion completion word aristotle used αἰτία present purpose greek word would better translated explanation cause words often used current english another translation aristotle meant four becauses four kinds answer questions17

word efficient used also translated aristotle moving initiating17
efficient causation connected aristotelian physics recognized four elements earth fire water added fifth element aether water earth intrinsic property gravitas heaviness intrinsically fall toward whereas fire intrinsic property levitas lightness intrinsically rise away earths center—the motionless center universe—in straight line accelerating substances approach natural place
remained earth however escape earth eventually achieving infinite speed—an absurdity—aristotle inferred universe finite size contains invisible substance held planet earth atmosphere sublunary sphere centered universe since celestial bodies exhibit perpetual unaccelerated motion orbiting planet earth unchanging relations aristotle inferred fifth element aither fills space composes celestial bodies intrinsically moves perpetual circles constant motion points object traveling straight line point back must stop either point returning

aristotle explained

cause means
sense result whose presence something comes being—eg bronze statue silver classes contain material cause
another sense form pattern essential formula classes contain it—eg ratio number general cause octave—and parts formula formal cause
source first beginning change rest plans cause father cause child general produces cause produced changes changed efficient cause
final cause walking health walk healthy saying consider supplied cause final cause
means towards arise instigation something else fatreducing purging drugs instruments causes health object although differ instruments others actions necessary conditions
metaphysics book section 1013a translated hugh tredennick71

aristotle discerned modes causation proper prior causation accidental chance causation causes proper accidental spoken potential actual particular generic language refers effects causes generic effects assigned generic causes particular effects particular causes actual effects operating causes
averting infinite regress aristotle inferred first mover—an unmoved mover first movers motion must caused unmoved mover must moved toward particular goal desire

cause effect must contiguous space time
cause must prior effect
must constant union betwixt cause effect chiefly quality constitutes relation

additionally three connected criteria come experience source philosophical reasonings

cause always produces effect effect never arises cause principle derive experience source philosophical reasonings
hanging upon hume says several different objects produce effect must means quality discover common amongst
