summary showing different epithelial cellstissues characteristics


general epithelial tissues classified number layers shape function cells134
three principal shapes associated epithelial cells are—squamous cuboidal columnar

squamous epithelium cells wider height flat scalelike
cuboidal epithelium cells whose height width approximately cube shaped
columnar epithelium cells taller wide columnshaped

layer epithelium classed either simple epithelium cell thick unilayered stratified epithelium stratified squamous epithelium stratified cuboidal epithelium stratified columnar epithelium cells thick multilayered56 types layering made cell shapes3 however taller simple columnar epithelial cells viewed cross section showing several nuclei appearing different heights confused stratified epithelia kind epithelium therefore described pseudostratified columnar epithelium7
transitional epithelium cells change squamous cuboidal depending amount tension epithelium8
simple epitheliumedit
simple epithelium single layer cells every cell direct contact basement membrane separates underlying connective tissue general found absorption filtration occur thinness epithelial barrier facilitates processes3
general simple epithelial tissues classified shape cells four major classes simple epithelium simple squamous simple cuboidal simple columnar pseudostratified3

simple squamous found lining areas passive diffusion gases occur skin walls capillaries linings pericardial pleural peritoneal cavities well linings alveoli lungs
simple cuboidal cells secretory absorptive excretory functions examples include small collecting ducts kidney pancreas salivary gland
simple columnar cells secretory absorptive excretory simple columnar epithelium ciliated nonciliated ciliated columnar found female reproductive tract uterus nonciliated epithelium also possess microvilli
pseudostratified columnar epithelium ciliated nonciliated ciliated type also called respiratory epithelium almost exclusively confined larger respiratory airways nasal cavity trachea bronchi

stratified epitheliumedit
stratified epithelium differs simple epithelium multilayered therefore found body linings withstand mechanical chemical insult layers abraded lost without exposing subepithelial layers cells flatten layers become apical though basal layers cells squamous cuboidal columnar9
stratified epithelia columnar cuboidal squamous type following specializations9


specialization
description


keratinized
particular case apical layers exterior cells dead lose nucleus cytoplasm instead contain tough resistant protein called keratin specialization makes epithelium waterproof found mammalian skin lining esophagus example nonkeratinized moist stratified epithelium9


parakeratinized
case apical layers cells filled keratin still retain nuclei nuclei pyknotic meaning highly condensed parakeratinized epithelium sometimes found oral mucosa upper regions esophagus10


transitional
transitional epithelia found tissues stretch appear stratified cuboidal tissue stretched stratified squamous organ distended tissue stretches sometimes called urothelium since almost exclusively found bladder ureters urethra9

squamous
squamous cells appearance thin flat plates look polygonal viewed above11 name comes squāma latin scale fish snake skin cells closely together tissues providing smooth lowfriction surface fluids move easily shape nucleus usually corresponds cell form helps identify type epithelium squamous cells tend horizontally flattened nearly oval shaped nuclei thin flattened form cell squamous epitheliium found lining surfaces skin alveoli lung enabling simple passive diffusion also found alveolar epithelium lungs specialized squamous epithelium also forms lining cavities blood vessels endothelium pericardium mesothelium body cavities


cuboidal
cuboidal epithelial cells cubelike shape appear square crosssection cell nucleus large spherical centre cell cuboidal epithelium commonly found secretive tissue exocrine glands absorptive tissue pancreas lining kidney tubules well ducts glands germinal epithelium covers female ovary germinal epithelium lines walls seminferous tubules testes also cuboidal type cuboidal cells provide protection active pumping material lumen passive depending location specialisation simple cuboidal epithelium commonly differentiates form secretory duct portions glands12 stratified cuboidal epithelium protects areas ducts sweat glands13 mammary glands salivary glands


columnar
columnar epithelial cells elongated columnshaped height least four times width nuclei elongated usually located near base cells columnar epithelium forms lining stomach intestines cells possess microvilli maximising surface area absorption microvilli form brush border cells ciliated move mucus function mucociliary clearance ciliated cells found fallopian tubes uterus central canal spinal cord columnar cells specialized sensory reception nose ears taste buds hair cells inner ears stereocilia similar microvilli goblet cells modified columnar cells found columnar epithelial cells duodenum secrete mucus acts lubricant singlelayered nonciliated columnar epithelium tends indicate absorptive function stratified columnar epithelium rare found lobar ducts salivary glands pharynx organs consists layer cells resting least layer epithelial cells squamous cuboidal columnar


pseudostratified
simple columnar epithelial cells whose nuclei appear different heights giving misleading hence pseudo impression epithelium stratified cells viewed cross section ciliated pseudostratified epithelial cells cilia cilia capable energy dependent pulsatile beating certain direction interaction cytoskeletal microtubules connecting structural proteins enzymes respiratory tract wafting effect produced causes mucus secreted locally goblet cells lubricate trap pathogens particles flow direction typically body ciliated epithelium found airways nose bronchi also found uterus fallopian tubes cilia propel ovum uterus


structureedit
cells epithelial tissue tightly packed form continuous sheet almost intercellular spaces epithelia usually separated underlying tissues extracellular fibrous basement membrane lining mouth lung alveoli kidney tubules made epithelial tissue lining blood lymphatic vessels specialised form epithelium called endothelium
locationedit

arthropods integument external skin consists single layer epithelial ectoderm arises cuticle15 outer covering chitin rigidity varies chemical composition
basement membraneedit
epithelial tissue rests basement membrane acts scaffolding epithelium grow regenerate injuries16 epithelial tissue nerve supply blood supply must nourished substances diffusing blood vessels underlying tissue basement membrane acts selectively permeable membrane determines substances able enter epithelium2
cell junctionsedit
cell junctions especially abundant epithelial tissues consist protein complexes provide contact neighbouring cells cell extracellular matrix build paracellular barrier epithelia control paracellular transport17
cell junctions contact points plasma membrane tissue cells mainly different types cell junctions tight junctions adherens junctions desmosomes hemidesmosomes junctions tight junctions pair transmembrane protein fused outer plasma membrane adherens junctions plaque protein layer inside plasma membrane attaches cells microfilaments desmosomes attach microfilaments cytoskeleton made keratin protein hemidesmosomes resemble desmosomes section made integrin transmembrane protein instead cadherin attach epithelial cell basement membrane junctions connect cytoplasm cells made proteins called connexins come together make connexioncitation needed
developmentedit
epithelial tissues derived embryological germ layerscitation needed

ectoderm epidermis
endoderm lining gastrointestinal tract
mesoderm inner linings body cavities

however important note pathologists consider endothelium mesothelium derived mesoderm true epithelium tissues present different pathology reason pathologists label cancers endothelium mesothelium sarcomas whereas true epithelial cancers called carcinomas also filaments support mesodermderived tissues distinct outside field pathology general accepted epithelium arises three germ layerscitation needed
