another science relevant study confluences chemistry sometimes mixing waters streams triggers chemical reaction particularly polluted stream united states geological survey gives example chemical changes occur stream contaminated acid mine drainage combines stream nearneutral water reactions happen rapidly influence subsequent transport metals downstream mixing zone5
natural phenomenon confluences obvious even casual observers difference color streams images article several examples according lynch color river determined many things type amount vegetation watershed geological properties dissolved chemicals sediments biologic content usually algae lynch also notes color differences persist miles downstream finally blend completely6
