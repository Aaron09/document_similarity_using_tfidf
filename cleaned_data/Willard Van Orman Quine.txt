rejection analytic–synthetic distinctionedit
also dogmas empiricism
1930s 1940s discussions rudolf carnap nelson goodman alfred tarski among others quine doubt tenability distinction analytic statements—those true simply meanings words bachelors unmarried—and synthetic statements true false virtue facts world distinction central logical positivism although quine normally associated verificationism philosophers believe tenet incompatible general philosophy language citing harvard colleague skinner analysis language verbal behavior20
like analytic philosophers quine accepted definition analytic true virtue meaning alone unlike however concluded ultimately definition circular words quine accepted analytic statements true definition argued notion truth definition unsatisfactory criticism kants epistemology similar 18th century writer johann gottfried herder individuals found fault kantian system sufficiently accounting dependence reasoning language
quines chief objection analyticity notion synonymy sameness meaning sentence analytic case substitutes synonym black proposition like black things black logical truth objection synonymy hinges upon problem collateral information intuitively feel distinction unmarried bachelors black dogs competent english speaker assent sentences conditions since speakers also access collateral information bearing historical existence black dogs quine maintains distinction universally known collateral information conceptual analytic truths
another approach quines objection analyticity synonymy emerges modal notion logical possibility traditional wittgensteinian view meaning held meaningful sentence associated region space possible worldscitation needed quine finds notion space problematic arguing distinction truths universally confidently believed necessarily true
confirmation holism ontological relativityedit
central theses underlying indeterminacy translation extensions quines work ontological relativity related doctrine confirmation holism premise confirmation holism theories propositions derived underdetermined empirical data data sensorydata evidence although theories justifiable failing data unworkably complex many equally justifiable alternatives greeks assumption unobservable homeric gods exist false supposition unobservable electromagnetic waves true justified solely ability explain observations
quine concluded dogmas empiricism follows

empiricist continue think conceptual scheme science tool ultimately predicting future experience light past experience physical objects conceptually imported situation convenient intermediaries definition terms experience simply irreducible posits comparable epistemologically gods homer part physicist believe physical objects homers gods consider scientific error believe otherwise point epistemological footing physical objects gods differ degree kind sorts entities enter conceptions cultural posits

quines ontological relativism evident passage agree pierre duhem collection empirical evidence would always many theories able account however duhems holism much restricted limited quines duhem underdetermination applies physics possibly natural science quine applies human knowledge thus possible verify falsify whole theories possible verify falsify individual statements almost particular statement saved given sufficiently radical modifications containing theory quine scientific thought forms coherent part could altered light empirical evidence empirical evidence could force revision given part
quines writings wide acceptance instrumentalism philosophy science
existence contraryedit
problem nonreferring names puzzle philosophy quine captured wrote

curious thing ontological problem simplicity three anglosaxon monosyllables answered moreover word—everything—and everyone accept answer true21

directly controversy goes

talk pegasus word pegasus refer answer something seem believe mystical entities answer nothing seem talk nothing sense made certainly said pegasus mythological winged horse make sense moreover speak truth speak truth must truth something cannot speaking nothing

quine resists temptation nonreferring terms meaningless reasons made clear instead tells must first determine whether terms refer know proper understand however czesław lejewski criticizes belief reducing matter empirical discovery seems formal distinction referring nonreferring terms elements domain lejewski writes

state affairs seem satisfactory idea rules inference depend empirical information forthcoming foreign character logical inquiry thorough reexamination inferences existential generalization universal instantiation prove worth

lejewski goes offer description free logic claims accommodates answer problem
lejewski also points free logic additionally handle problem empty statements like
















displaystyle forall xfxrightarrow exists

quine considered problem empty unrealistic left lejewski unsatisfied22
logicedit
course career quine published numerous technical expository papers formal logic reprinted selected logic papers ways paradox
quine confined logic classical bivalent firstorder logic hence truth falsity nonempty universe discourse hence following logic quine

higherorder logic theory referred higherorder logic theory disguise
much principia mathematica included logic logic quine
formal systems involving intensional notions especially modality quine especially hostile modal logic quantification battle largely lost saul kripkes relational semantics became canonical modal logics

quine wrote three undergraduate texts formal logic

elementary logic teaching introductory course 1940 quine discovered extant texts philosophy students justice quantification theory firstorder predicate logic quine wrote book weeks solution teaching needs
methods logic four editions book resulted advanced undergraduate course logic quine taught world 1978 retirement
philosophy logic concise witty undergraduate treatment number quinian themes prevalence usemention confusions dubiousness quantified modal logic nonlogical character higherorder logic

mathematical logic based quines graduate teaching 1930s shows much principia mathematica took 1000 pages said pages proofs concise even cryptic last chapter gödels incompleteness theorem tarskis indefinability theorem along article quine 1946 became launching point raymond smullyans later lucid exposition related results
quines work logic gradually became dated respects techniques teach discuss include analytic tableaux recursive functions model theory treatment metalogic left something desired example mathematical logic include proofs soundness completeness early career notation writings logic often idiosyncratic later writings nearly always employed nowdated notation principia mathematica simplicity preferred method exposited methods logic determining satisfiability quantified formulas richness philosophical linguistic insights fine prose expressed
quines original work formal logic 1960 onwards variants predicate functor logic several ways proposed logic without quantifiers comprehensive treatment predicate functor logic history quine 1976 introduction chpt methods logic
quine warm possibility formal logic would eventually applied outside philosophy mathematics wrote several papers sort boolean algebra employed electrical engineering edward mccluskey devised quine–mccluskey algorithm reducing boolean equations minimum covering prime implicants
theoryedit
contributions logic include elegant expositions number technical results theory quine innovative always maintained mathematics required theory theory quite distinct logic flirted nelson goodmans nominalism backed away failed find nominalist grounding mathematics
course career quine proposed three variants axiomatic theory including axiom extensionality

foundations creates manipulates sets using single axiom schema admissibility namely axiom schema stratified comprehension whereby individuals satisfying stratified formula compose stratified formula type theory would allow ontology include types however quines theory feature types metamathematics curious allows many large sets nowcanonical theory allow even sets axiom choice hold since axiom choice holds finite sets failure axiom proves includes infinite sets relative consistency open question modification jensen admitting urelements entities members sets lack elements turns consistent relative peano arithmetic thus vindicating intuition behind quinian theories following derivation foundational mathematics rosser 1952
theory mathematical logic augmented proper classes neumann–bernays–gödel theory except axiomatized much simpler
theory theory logic away stratification almost entirely derived single axiom schema quine derived foundations mathematics book includes definitive exposition quines theory virtual sets relations surveyed axiomatic theory stood circa 1960 however fraenkel barhillel levy 1973 better surveying theory stood midcentury

three theories admit universal class since free hierarchy types need distinct universal class type level
quines theory background logic driven desire minimize posits innovation pushed pushed innovations introduced quine connective sheffer stroke quantifier universal quantifier polyadic predicates reduced dyadic predicate interpretable membership rules proof limited modus ponens substitution preferred conjunction either disjunction conditional conjunction least semantic ambiguity delighted discover early career first order logic theory could grounded mere primitive notions abstraction inclusion elegant introduction parsimony quines approach logic foundations mathematical logic logical point view
quines epistemologyedit
challenged dominant analytic–synthetic distinction quine also took traditional normative epistemology according quine traditional epistemology tried justify sciences effort exemplified rudolf carnap failed replace traditional epistemology empirical study sensory inputs produce theoretical outputs23 epistemology something like simply falls place chapter psychology hence natural science studies natural phenomenon physical human subject human subject accorded certain experimentally controlled input certain patterns irradiation assorted frequencies instance fullness time subject delivers output description threedimensional external world history relation meager input torrential output relation prompted study somewhat reasons always prompted epistemology namely order evidence relates theory ways ones theory nature transcends available evidencebut conspicuous difference epistemology epistemological enterprise psychological setting make free empirical psychology quine 1969 82–3
