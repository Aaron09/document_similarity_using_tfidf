stereotypes help make sense world form categorization helps simplify systematize information thus information easily identified recalled predicted reacted to13 stereotypes categories objects people stereotypes objects people different possible1 within stereotypes objects people similar possible1
gordon allport suggested possible answers people find easier understand categorized information22 first people consult category identify response patterns second categorized information specific noncategorized information categorization accentuates properties shared members group third people readily describe object category objects category distinct characteristics finally people take granted characteristics particular category category arbitrary grouping
complementary perspective theorizes stereotypes function time energysavers allow people efficiently1 another perspective suggests stereotypes peoples biased perceptions social contexts1 view people stereotypes shortcuts make sense social contexts makes persons task understanding world less cognitively demanding1

people actively create certain images relevant outgroups stereotyping people ingroup longer clearly andor positively differentiated relevant outgroups want restore intergroup differentiation state favours ingroup1323
social functions selfcategorizationedit
people change stereotype ingroups outgroups suit context323 people likely selfstereotype ingroup homogenous intergroup context less likely intragroup context need emphasise group membership great23 stereotypes emphasise person’s group membership steps first stereotypes emphasise person’s similarities ingroup members relevant dimensions also person’s differences outgroup members relevant dimensions23 second stereotypes emphasise withingroup similarities betweengroup differences salient person’s social identity becomes depersonalised person is23 depersonalised person abandons individual differences embraces stereotypes associated relevant group membership23

john turner proposed 198723 ingroup members disagree outgroup stereotype three possible collective actions follow first ingroup members negotiate conclude different outgroup stereotypes stereotyping different subgroups outgroup russian gymnasts versus russian boxers second ingroup members negotiate conclude disagreeing categorical differences amongst accordingly context better categorise ingroup members different categories democrats versus republican shared category american finally ingroup members influence arrive common outgroup stereotype
formationedit
different disciplines give different accounts stereotypes develop psychologists focus individuals experience groups patterns communication groups intergroup conflict sociologists focus relations among different groups social structure suggest stereotypes result conflict poor parenting inadequate mental emotional development stereotypes formed main factors explain persistence first cognitive effects schematic processing schema make member group behaves expect behavior confirms even strengthens existing stereotypes second affective emotional aspects prejudice render logical arguments stereotypes ineffective countering power emotional responses24
correspondence biasedit
main article correspondence bias
correspondence bias refers tendency ascribe persons behavior disposition personality underestimate extent situational factors elicited behavior correspondence bias play important role stereotype formation25
example study roguer yzerbyt 1999 participants watched video showing students randomly instructed find arguments either euthanasia students argued favor euthanasia came department different departments results showed participants attributed students responses attitudes although made clear video students choice position participants reported group membership department students belonged affected students opinions euthanasia students perceived favor euthanasia students different departments despite fact pretest revealed subjects preexisting expectations attitudes toward euthanasia department students belong attribution error created stereotype students likely support euthanasia26
nier 2012 found people tend draw dispositional inferences behavior ignore situational constraints likely stereotype lowstatus groups incompetent highstatus groups competent participants listened descriptions fictitious groups pacific islanders described higher status second study subjects rated actual groups poor wealthy women united states terms competence subjects scored high measure correspondence bias stereotyped poor women fictitious lowerstatus pacific islanders incompetent whereas stereotyped wealthy highstatus pacific islanders competent correspondence bias significant predictor stereotyping even controlling measures linked beliefs status groups justworld hypothesis social dominance orientation27
illusory correlationedit
main article illusory correlation
research shown stereotypes develop based cognitive mechanism known illusory correlation erroneous inference relationship events12829 statistically infrequent events cooccur observers overestimate frequency cooccurrence events underlying reason rare infrequent events distinctive salient paired become even heightened salience results attention effective encoding strengthens belief events correlated303132
intergroup context illusory correlations lead people misattribute rare behaviors traits higher rates minority group members majority groups even display proportion behaviors traits black people instance minority group united states interaction blacks relatively infrequent event average white american similarly undesirable behavior crime statistically less frequent desirable behavior since events blackness undesirable behavior distinctive sense infrequent combination leads observers overestimate rate cooccurrence30 similarly workplaces women underrepresented negative behaviors errors occur less frequently positive behaviors women become strongly associated mistakes men33
landmark study david hamilton richard gifford 1976 examined role illusory correlation stereotype formation subjects instructed read descriptions behaviors performed members groups negative behaviors outnumbered positive actions group smaller group making negative behaviors membership group relatively infrequent distinctive participants asked performed actions person group group results showed subjects overestimated frequency distinctive events membership group negative behavior cooccurred evaluated group negatively despite fact proportion positive negative behaviors equivalent groups actual correlation group membership behaviors30 although hamilton gifford found similar effect positive behaviors infrequent events metaanalytic review studies showed illusory correlation effects stronger infrequent distinctive information negative28
hamilton giffords distinctivenessbased explanation stereotype formation subsequently extended31 1994 study mcconnell sherman hamilton found people formed stereotypes based information distinctive time presentation considered distinctive time judgement34 person judges nondistinctive information memory distinctive information reencoded rerepresented distinctive first processed34
common environmentedit
explanation stereotypes shared result common environment stimulates people react way1
problem ‘common environment’ explanation general explain shared stereotypes occur without direct stimuli1 research since 1930s suggested people highly similar describe different racial national groups although people personal experience groups describing35

another explanation says people socialised adopt stereotypes1 psychologists believe although stereotypes absorbed stereotypes usually acquired early childhood influence parents teachers peers media
stereotypes defined social values stereotypes change changes social values1 suggestion stereotype content depend social values reflects walter lippmans argument 1922 publication stereotypes rigid cannot changed will10
studies emerging since 1940s refuted suggestion stereotype contents cannot changed studies suggested group’s stereotype another group would become less positive depending whether intergroup relationship improved degraded103637 intergroup events world persian gulf conflict often changed intergroup relationships example wwii black american students held negative stereotype people countries united states’s wwii enemies10 changes intergroup relationship relevant stereotypes change11
intergroup relationsedit
according third explanation shared stereotypes neither caused coincidence common stimuli socialisation explanation posits stereotypes shared group members motivated behave certain ways stereotypes reflect behaviours1 important note explanation stereotypes consequence cause intergroup relations explanation assumes important people acknowledge ingroup outgroup emphasise difference outgroup members similarity ingroup members1
activationedit
dualprocess model cognitive processing stereotypes asserts automatic activation stereotypes followed controlled processing stage individual choose disregard ignore stereotyped information brought mind12
number studies found stereotypes activated automatically patricia devine 1989 example suggested stereotypes automatically activated presence member symbolic equivalent stereotyped group unintentional activation stereotype equally strong high lowprejudice persons words related cultural stereotype blacks presented subliminally ostensibly unrelated impressionformation task subjects read paragraph describing raceunspecified target persons behaviors rated target person several trait scales results showed participants received high proportion racial words rated target person story significantly hostile participants presented lower proportion words related stereotype effect held true high lowprejudice subjects measured modern racism scale thus racial stereotype activated even lowprejudice individuals personally endorse it123839 studies using alternative priming methods shown activation gender stereotypes also automatic4041
subsequent research suggested relation category activation stereotype activation complex3942 lepore brown 1997 instance noted words used devines study neutral category labels blacks stereotypic attributes lazy argued neutral category labels presented people high prejudice would respond differently design similar devines lepore brown primed category africanamericans using labels blacks west indians assessed differential activation associated stereotype subsequent impressionformation task found highprejudice participants increased ratings target person negative stereotypic dimensions decreased positive dimension whereas lowprejudice subjects tended opposite direction results suggest level prejudice stereotype endorsement affects peoples judgements category stereotype primed43
research shown people trained activate counterstereotypic information thereby reduce automatic activation negative stereotypes study kawakami 2000 example participants presented category label taught respond stereotypic traits nonstereotypic traits training period subjects showed reduced stereotype activation4445 effect based learning positive stereotypes rather negation already existing ones45
automatic behavioral outcomesedit
empirical evidence suggests stereotype activation automatically influence social behavior46474849 example bargh chen burrows 1996 activated stereotype elderly among half participants administering scrambledsentence test participants words related stereotypes subjects primed stereotype walked significantly slowly control group although test include words specifically referring slowness thus acting stereotype suggests elderly people another experiment bargh chen burrows also found stereotype blacks includes notion aggression subliminal exposure black faces increased likelihood randomly selected white college students reacted aggression hostility participants subconsciously viewed white face50 similarly correll 2002 showed activated stereotypes blacks influence peoples behavior series experiments black white participants played video game black white person shown holding harmless object mobile phone participants decide quickly possible whether shoot target target person armed black white participants faster deciding shoot target black white target unarmed participants avoided shooting quickly white time pressure made shooter bias even pronounced51

stereotypes efficient shortcuts sensemaking tools however keep people processing unexpected information individual thus biasing impression formation process1 early researchers believed stereotypes inaccurate representations reality35 series pioneering studies 1930s found empirical support widely held racial stereotypes10 mid1950s gordon allport wrote possible stereotype grow defiance evidence22
research role illusory correlations formation stereotypes suggests stereotypes develop incorrect inferences relationship events membership social group good attributes means least stereotypes inaccurate28303234
empirical social science research shows stereotypes often accurate52 jussim reviewed four studies concerning racial seven studies examined gender stereotypes demographic characteristics academic achievement personality behavior based authors argued aspects ethnic gender stereotypes accurate stereotypes concerning political affiliation nationality much less accurate53 study terracciano also found stereotypic beliefs nationality reflect actual personality traits people different cultures54

crocker 1991 showed black participants evaluated white person aware race black subjects mistrusted feedback attributing negative feedback evaluators stereotypes positive feedback evaluators desire appear unbiased black participants race unknown evaluator accepting feedback58
attributional ambiguity shown affect persons selfesteem receive positive evaluations stereotyped individuals uncertain whether really deserved success consequently find difficult take credit achievements case negative feedback ambiguity shown protective effect selfesteem allows people assign blame external causes studies however found effect holds stereotyped individuals absolutely certain negative outcomes evaluatorss prejudice room uncertainty remains stereotyped individuals tend blame themselves56

word zanna cooper 1974 demonstrated effects stereotypes context interview white participants interviewed black white subjects prior experiments trained standardized manner analysis videotaped interviews showed black applicants treated differently received shorter amounts interview time less contact interviewers made speech errors stutters sentence incompletions incoherent sounds physically distanced black applicants second experiment trained interviewers instructed treat applicants white like whites blacks treated first experiment result applicants treated like blacks first experiment behaved nervous manner received negative performance ratings interviewees receiving treatment previously afforded whites76
1977 study snyder tanke berscheid found similar pattern social interactions women male undergraduate students asked talk female undergraduates believed physically attractive unattractive phone conversations taped analysis showed thought talking attractive woman communicated positive friendlier manner believed talking unattractive women altered womens behavior female subjects unknowingly perceived physically attractive behaved friendly likeable sociable manner comparison subjects regarded unattractive77
discriminationedit
stereotypes simplify justify social reality potentially powerful effects people perceive treat another78 result stereotypes lead discrimination labor markets domains79 example tilcsik 2011 found employers seek applicants stereotypically male heterosexual traits particularly likely engage discrimination suggesting discrimination basis sexual orientation partly rooted specific stereotypes stereotypes loom large many labor markets14 agerström rooth 2011 showed automatic obesity stereotypes captured implicit association test predict real hiring discrimination obese80 similarly experiments suggest gender stereotypes play important role judgments affect hiring decisions8182
