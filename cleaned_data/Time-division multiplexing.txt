multiplexed digital transmissionedit
circuitswitched networks public switched telephone network pstn desirable transmit multiple subscriber calls transmission medium effectively utilize bandwidth medium3 allows transmitting receiving telephone switches create channels tributaries within transmission stream standard voice signal data rate kbits34 circuit runs much higher signal bandwidth permitting bandwidth divided time frames time slots voice signal multiplexed onto line transmitter frame consists voice frames line bandwidth kbits3
voice time slot frame called channel european systems standard frames contain digital voice channels american systems contain channels standards also contain extra bits time slots signaling synchronization bits3
multiplexing digital voice channels called higher order multiplexing higher order multiplexing accomplished multiplexing standard frames example european channel frame formed multiplexing four standard channel frames higher order multiplex four frames immediate lower order combined creating multiplexes bandwidth kbits 1920 etc3

plesiochronous digital hierarchy developed standard multiplexing higher order frames created larger numbers channels multiplexing standard europeans channel frames solution worked however suffered several inherent drawbacks ultimately resulted development synchronous digital hierarchy requirements drove development these34

synchronous clocks system must align reference clock
serviceoriented must route traffic exchange exchange without worrying exchanges bandwidth reserved fixed level fixed period time
allow frames size removed inserted frame size
easily manageable capability transferring management data across links
provide high levels recovery faults
provide high data rates multiplexing size frame limited technology
give reduced rate errors

network functions connected using highspeed optic fibre optic fibre uses light pulses transmit data therefore extremely fast modern optic fibre transmission makes wavelengthdivision multiplexing signals transmitted across fibre transmitted different wavelengths creating additional channels transmission increases speed capacity link turn reduces unit total costs34
statistical timedivision multiplexingedit
statistical timedivision multiplexing stdm advanced version address terminal data transmitted together better routing using stdm allows bandwidth split line many college corporate campuses type distribute bandwidth
10mbit line entering network stdm used provide terminals dedicated connection 996mb common however grant bandwidth much needed stdm reserve time slot terminal rather assigns slot terminal requiring data sent received
primary form used circuit mode communication fixed number channels constant bandwidth channel bandwidth reservation distinguishes timedivision multiplexing statistical multiplexing statistical timedivision multiplexing pure time slots recurrent fixed order preallocated channels rather scheduled packetbypacket basis
