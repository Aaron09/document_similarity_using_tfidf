right ascension blue declination green seen outside celestial sphere


main article equatorial coordinate system
right ascension celestial equivalent terrestrial longitude right ascension longitude measure angle primary direction zero point equator right ascension measured vernal equinox first point aries place celestial sphere crosses celestial equator south north march equinox currently located constellation pisces right ascension measured continuously full circle equinox towards east4
units angular measure could chosen right ascension customarily measured hours minutes seconds equivalent full circle astronomers chosen unit measure right ascension measure stars location timing passage highest point earth rotates line passes highest point called meridian projection longitude line onto celestial sphere since complete circle contains right ascension 360° degrees ​1⁄24 circle measured right ascension ​1⁄24×60 circle measured right ascension minutes also written ​1⁄24×60×60 circle contains right ascension seconds also written full circle measured rightascension units contains 400s 440m 24h5
also hour angle
right ascensions measured hours rotation earth used time positions objects example star meridian star meridian sidereal hours later
sidereal hour angle used celestial navigation similar right ascension increases westward rather eastward usually measured degrees complement right ascension respect 24h6 important confuse sidereal hour angle astronomical concept hour angle measures angular distance object westward local meridian

effects precessionedit
main article axial precession
earths axis rotates slowly westward poles ecliptic completing circuit 26000 years effect known precession causes coordinates stationary celestial objects change continuously rather slowly therefore equatorial coordinates including right ascension inherently relative year observation astronomers specify reference particular year known epoch coordinates different epochs must mathematically rotated match match standard epoch7 right ascension fixed stars near ecliptic equator increases seconds year average minutes century fixed stars ecliptic rate change anything negative infinity positive infinity right ascension polaris increasing quickly north ecliptic pole draco south ecliptic pole dorado always right ascension respectively
currently used standard epoch j20000 january 2000 1200 prefix indicates julian epoch prior j20000 astronomers used successive besselian epochs b18750 b19000 b195008

concept right ascension known least back hipparchus measured stars equatorial coordinates century hipparchus successors made star catalogs ecliptic coordinates limited special cases
invention telescope became possible astronomers observe celestial objects greater detail provided telescope could kept pointed object period time easiest equatorial mount allows telescope aligned pivots parallel earths axis motorized clock drive often used equatorial mount cancel earths rotation equatorial mount became widely adopted observation equatorial coordinate system includes right ascension adopted time simplicity equatorial mounts could accurately pointed objects known right ascension declination setting circles first star catalog right ascension declination john flamsteeds historia coelestis britannica 1712 1725
