pharmacological treatment parkinsons disease


cure parkinsons disease medications surgery physical treatment provide relief much effective treatments available neurological disorders like alzheimer’s disease motor neuron disease parkinson plus syndromes main families drugs useful treating motor symptoms levodopa always combined dopa decarboxylase inhibitor sometimes also comt inhibitor dopamine agonists maob inhibitors stage disease disease onset determine group useful71
three stages distinguished initial stage individual already developed disability requiring pharmacological treatment second stage associated development complications related levodopa usage third stage symptoms unrelated dopamine deficiency levodopa treatment predominate72
treatment first stage aims optimal trade symptom control treatment sideeffects start levodopa treatment postponed initially using medications maob inhibitors dopamine agonists instead hope delaying onset complications levodopa use73 however levodopa still effective treatment motor symptoms delayed patients whose quality life impaired symptoms levodoparelated dyskinesias correlate strongly duration severity disease duration levodopa treatment delaying therapy really provide much longer dyskinesiafree time early use74
second stage reduce symptoms controlling fluctuations effect medication sudden withdrawals medication overuse managed73 oral medications enough control symptoms surgery deep brain stimulation subcutaneous waking apomorphine infusion enteral dopa pumps use75 third stage presents many challenging problems requiring variety treatments psychiatric symptoms orthostatic hypotension bladder dysfunction etc75 final stages disease palliative care provided improve quality life76
medications
levodopa
motor symptoms result reduced dopamine production brains basal ganglia dopamine cross bloodbrain barrier cannot taken medicine boost brains depleted levels dopamine however precursor dopamine levodopa pass brain readily converted dopamine administration levodopa temporarily diminishes motor symptoms levodopa widely used treatment years73
5–10 levodopa crosses blood–brain barrier much remainder metabolized dopamine elsewhere body causing variety side effects including nausea vomiting orthostatic hypotension77 carbidopa benserazide dopa decarboxylase inhibitors cross bloodbrain barrier inhibit conversion levodopa dopamine outside brain reducing side effects improving availability levodopa passage brain drugs usually taken along levodopa often combined levodopa pill78
levodopa leads long term development complications involuntary movements called dyskinesias fluctuations effectiveness medication73 fluctuations occur person cycle phases good response medication reduced symptoms state phases poor response medication significant symptoms state73 using lower doses levodopa reduce risk severity levodopainduced complications79 former strategy reduce levodoparelated dyskinesia fluctuations withdraw levodopa medication time discouraged since bring dangerous side effects neuroleptic malignant syndrome73 people eventually need levodopa later develop levodopainduced fluctuations dyskinesias73
controlledrelease versions levodopa older controlledrelease levodopa preparations poor unreliable absorption bioavailability demonstrated improved control motor symptoms reduction levodoparelated complications compared immediate release preparations newer extendedrelease levodopa preparation seem effective reducing fluctuations many patients problems persist intestinal infusions levodopa duodopa result striking improvements fluctuations compared oral levodopa fluctuations insufficient uptake caused gastroparesis oral longer acting formulations study modes delivery inhaled transdermal developed78
comt inhibitors
tolcapone inhibits activity comt enzyme degrades dopamine73 used complement levodopa however usefulness limited possible complications liver damage73 similarly effective drug entacapone shown cause significant alterations liver function73 licensed preparations entacapone contain entacapone alone combination carbidopa levodopa73
dopamine agonists
several dopamine agonists bind dopamine receptors brain similar effects levodopa73 initially used complementary therapy levodopa individuals experiencing levodopa complications onoff fluctuations dyskinesias mainly used first therapy motor symptoms delaying initiation levodopa therapy delaying onset levodopas complications7380 dopamine agonists include bromocriptine pergolide pramipexole ropinirole piribedil cabergoline apomorphine lisuride
though dopamine agonists less effective levodopa controlling motor symptoms usually effective enough manage symptoms first years treatment10 dyskinesias dopamine agonists rare younger people along complications become common older onset10 thus dopamine agonists preferred initial treatment younger onset levodopa preferred older onset pd10
dopamine agonists produce significant although usually mild side effects including drowsiness hallucinations insomnia nausea constipation73 sometimes side effects appear even minimal clinically effective dose leading physician search different drug73 agonists related impulse control disorders compulsive sexual activity eating gambling shopping even strongly levodopa81 tend expensive levodopa10
apomorphine nonorally administered dopamine agonist used reduce periods dyskinesia late pd73 administered intermittent injections continuous subcutaneous infusions73 since secondary effects confusion hallucinations common individuals receiving apomorphine treatment closely monitored73 dopamine agonists administered skin patches lisuride rotigotine useful people initial stages possibly control states advanced state82
maob inhibitors
maob inhibitors safinamide selegiline rasagiline increase amount dopamine basal ganglia inhibiting activity monoamine oxidase maob enzyme breaks dopamine73 like dopamine agonists delay commencement levodopa therapy early disease maob inhibitors produce adverse effects less effective levodopa controlling motor symptoms studies effectiveness advanced stage although results suggest useful reduce fluctuations periods73 initial study indicated selegiline combination levodopa increased risk death later disproven73
drugs
main article antiparkinson medication
drugs amantadine anticholinergics useful treatment motor symptoms however evidence supporting lacks quality first choice treatments73 addition motor symptoms accompanied diverse range symptoms number drugs used treat problems83 examples quetiapine psychosis cholinesterase inhibitors dementia modafinil daytime sleepiness8384
