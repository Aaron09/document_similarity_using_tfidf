exchange rate regimeedit
main article exchange rate regime
country determines exchange rate regime apply currency example currency freefloating pegged fixed hybrid
currency freefloating exchange rate allowed vary currencies determined market forces supply demand exchange rates currencies likely change almost constantly quoted financial markets mainly banks around world
movable adjustable system system fixed exchange rates provision revaluation usually devaluation currency example 1994 2005 chinese yuan renminbi pegged united states dollar 82768 china country world 1967 western european countries maintained fixed exchange rates dollar based bretton woods system system abandoned favor floating marketbased regimes market pressures speculation according president richard nixon speech august 1971 known nixon shock
still governments strive keep currency within narrow range result currencies become overvalued undervalued leading excessive trade deficits surpluses
fluctuations exchange ratesedit
marketbased exchange rate change whenever values either component currencies change currency becomes valuable whenever demand greater available supply become less valuable whenever demand less available supply mean people longer want money means prefer holding wealth form possibly another currency
increased demand currency either increased transaction demand money increased speculative demand money transaction demand highly correlated countrys level business activity gross domestic product employment levels people unemployed less public whole spend goods services central banks typically little difficulty adjusting available money supply accommodate changes demand money business transactions
speculative demand much harder central banks accommodate influence adjusting interest rates speculator currency return interest rate high enough general higher countrys interest rates greater demand currency arguedby speculation undermine real economic growth particular since large currency speculators deliberately create downward pressure currency shorting order force central bank currency keep stable happens speculator currency back depreciates close position thereby take profitcitation needed
carrier companies shipping goods nation another exchange rates often impact severely therefore carriers charge account fluctuations910
purchasing power currencyedit
real exchange rate purchasing power currency relative another current exchange rates prices ratio number units given countrys currency necessary market basket goods country acquiring countrys currency foreign exchange market number units given countrys currency would necessary market basket directly given country various ways measure rer11
thus real exchange rate exchange rate times relative prices market basket goods countries example purchasing power dollar relative euro dollar price euro dollars euro times euro price unit market basket eurosgoods unit divided dollar price market basket dollars goods unit hence dimensionless exchange rate expressed dollars euro times relative price currencies terms ability purchase units market basket euros goods unit divided dollars goods unit goods freely tradable foreign domestic residents purchased identical baskets goods purchasing power parity would hold exchange rate deflators price levels countries real exchange rate would always equal
rate change real exchange rate time euro versus dollar equals rate appreciation euro positive negative percentage rate change dollarspereuro exchange rate plus inflation rate euro minus inflation rate dollar
real exchange rate equilibrium misalignmentedit
real exchange rate represents nominal exchange rate adjusted relative price domestic foreign goods services thus reflecting competitiveness country respect rest world12 detail appreciation currency higher level domestic inflation drives worsening country’s competitiveness reducing current account hand currency depreciation generates opposite effect improving country’s ca13
evidence generally reaches steady level longterm process faster small open economies characterized fixed exchange rates14 substantial persistent deviation longrun equilibrium level socalled misalignment shown produce negative impacts country’s balance payments15 overvalued means current equilibrium value whereas undervalued indicates contrary16 specifically prolonged overvaluation widely considered early sign upcoming crisis fact country becomes vulnerable speculative attacks currency crisis happened thailand 1997 asian financial crisis17 side protracted undervaluation usually generates pressure domestic prices changing consumers’ consumption incentives misallocating resources tradable nontradable sectors18
given misalignment particular overvaluation undermine country’s exportoriented development strategy equilibrium measurement crucial policymakers19 unfortunately variable cannot observed common method order estimate equilibrium universally accepted purchasing power parity theory according equilibrium level assumed remain constant time nevertheless equilibrium fixed value follows trend economic fundamentals20 different monetary fiscal policies asymmetrical shocks home country abroad21 consequently doctrine largely debated years given signal natural movement towards equilibrium misalignment
starting 1980s order overcome limitations approach many researchers tried find alternative equilibrium measures22 popular approaches economic literature fundamental equilibrium exchange rate feer developed williamson 199423 behavioural equilibrium exchange rate beer initially estimated clark macdonald 199824 feer focuses longrun determinants rather shortterm cyclical speculative forces25 represents consistent macroeconomic balance characterized achievement internal external balances time internal balance reached level output line full employment available factors production stable rate inflation26 hand external balance holds actual future balances compatible longterm sustainable capital flows27 nevertheless feer viewed normative measure since based “ideal” economic conditions related internal external balances particularly since sustainable position defined exogenous value approach broadly questioned time contrast beer entails econometric analysis behaviour considering significant deviations equilibrium level consequence changes economic fundamentals according method beer results economic fundamentals equilibrium values28 therefore total misalignment given extent economic fundamentals differ longrun sustainable levels short beer general approach feer since limited longterm perspective able explain cyclical movements29
bilateral effective exchange rateedit




example gnpweighted nominal exchange rate history basket important currencies dollar euro japanese chinese renminbi swiss franks pound sterling


bilateral exchange rate involves currency pair effective exchange rate weighted average basket foreign currencies viewed overall measure countrys external competitiveness nominal effective exchange rate neer weighted inverse asymptotic trade weights real effective exchange rate reer adjusts neer appropriate foreign price level deflates home country price level11 compared neer weighted effective exchange rate might appropriate considering global investment phenomenon
parallel exchange rateedit
many countries distinction official exchange rate permitted transactions parallel exchange rate responds excess demand foreign currency official exchange rate degree parallel exchange rate exceeds official exchange rate known parallel premium30
uncovered interest rate parityedit
also interest rate parity uncovered interest rate parity
uncovered interest rate parity uirp states appreciation depreciation currency another currency might neutralized change interest rate differential interest rates increase japanese interest rates remain unchanged dollar depreciate japanese amount prevents arbitrage reality opposite appreciation quite frequently happens shortterm explained future exchange rate reflected forward exchange rate stated today example forward exchange rate dollar said discount buys fewer japanese forward rate spot rate said premium
uirp showed proof working 1990s contrary theory currencies high interest rates characteristically appreciated rather depreciated reward containment inflation higheryielding currency
balance payments modeledit
balance payments model holds foreign exchange rates equilibrium level produce stable current account balance nation trade deficit experience reduction foreign exchange reserves ultimately lowers depreciates value currency cheaper undervalued currency renders nations goods exports affordable global market making imports expensive intermediate period imports forced exports rise thus stabilizing trade balance bring currency towards equilibrium
like purchasing power parity balance payments model focuses largely tradeable goods services ignoring increasing role global capital flows words money chasing goods services larger extent financial assets stocks bonds flows capital account item balance payments thus balancing deficit current account increase capital flows given rise asset market model effectively
asset market modeledit
also capital asset pricing model capital outflow




world banknotes


increasing volume trading financial assets stocks bonds required rethink impact exchange rates economic variables economic growth inflation productivity longer drivers currency movements proportion foreign exchange transactions stemming cross bordertrading financial assets dwarfed extent currency transactions generated trading goods services31
asset market approach views currencies asset prices traded efficient financial market consequently currencies increasingly demonstrating strong correlation markets particularly equities
like stock exchange money made lost trading investors speculators foreign exchange market currencies traded spot foreign exchange options markets spot market represents current exchange rates whereas options derivatives exchange rates
manipulation exchange ratesedit
country gain advantage international trade controls market currency keep value typically national central bank engaging open market operations foreign exchange market early twentyfirst century widely asserted peoples republic china long period time32
