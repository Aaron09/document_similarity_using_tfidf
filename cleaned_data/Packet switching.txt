animation demonstrating data packet switching across network


simple definition packet switching

routing transferring data means addressed packets channel occupied transmission packet upon completion transmission channel made available transfer traffic45

packet switching features delivery variable rate data streams realized sequences packets computer network allocates transmission resources needed using statistical multiplexing dynamic bandwidth allocation techniques traverse network nodes switches routers packets received buffered queued transmitted stored forwarded resulting variable latency throughput depending link capacity traffic load network
packet switching contrasts another principal networking paradigm circuit switching method preallocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically communication session constant rate latency nodes cases billable services cellular communication services circuit switching characterized unit connection time even data transferred packet switching characterized unit information transmitted characters packets messages
packet mode communication implemented without intermediate forwarding nodes packet switches routers packets normally forwarded intermediate network nodes asynchronously using firstin firstout buffering forwarded according scheduling discipline fair queuing traffic shaping differentiated guaranteed quality service weighted fair queuing leaky bucket case shared physical medium radio 10base5 packets delivered according multiple access scheme
historyedit
information history internet
late 1950s force established wide area network semiautomatic ground environment sage radar defense system sought system might survive nuclear attack enable response thus diminishing attractiveness first strike advantage enemies6
leonard kleinrock conducted early research queueing theory published book related field digital message switching without packets 19617
concept switching small blocks data first explored independently paul baran rand corporation starting late 1950s subsequently donald davies national physical laboratory uk8910
baran developed concept distributed adaptive message block switching research rand corporation force communications networks could survive nuclear wars11 first presented force summer 1961 briefing b2656 later published rand report p2626 196212 finally report 3420 196413 report p2626 described general architecture largescale distributed survivable communications network work focuses three ideas decentralized network multiple paths points dividing user messages message blocks delivery messages store forward switching
donald davies national physical laboratory developed similar message routing concept 1965 called packet switching accessible name barans terminology proposed building nationwide network uk14 gave talk proposal 1966 person ministry defence told barans work member davies team roger scantlebury lawrence roberts 1967 symposium operating system principles suggested arpanet15 davies chosen parameters original network design baran packet size 1024 bits 1966 davies proposed network built laboratory serve needs prove feasibility packet switching pilot experiment 19671617 data communications network entered service 196918
building earlier work queueing theory leonard kleinrock subsequently carried theoretical work model performance packetswitched networks underpinned development arpanet team also carried simulation work packet networks18
1974 vint cerf kahn published specifications transmission control protocol internetworking protocol sharing resources using packetswitching among nodes19 monolithic protocol later layered atop internet protocol
french cyclades network designed louis pouzin early 1970s first make hosts responsible reliable delivery data rather centralized service network
connectionless connectionoriented modesedit
packet switching classified connectionless packet switching also known datagram switching connectionoriented packet switching also known virtual circuit switching
examples connectionless protocols ethernet internet protocol user datagram protocol connectionoriented protocols include frame relay multiprotocol label switching mpls transmission control protocol
connectionless mode packet includes complete addressing information packets routed individually sometimes resulting different paths outoforder delivery packet labeled destination address source address port numbers also labeled sequence number packet precludes need dedicated path help packet find destination means much information needed packet header therefore larger information needs looked powerhungry contentaddressable memory packet dispatched different routes potentially system much work every packet connectionoriented system connection setup less information applications requirements destination original messagedata reassembled correct order based packet sequence number thus virtual connection also known virtual circuit byte stream provided enduser transport layer protocol although intermediate network nodes provides connectionless network layer service
connectionoriented transmission requires setup phase involved node packet transferred establish parameters communication packets include connection identifier rather address information negotiated endpoints delivered order error checking address information transferred node connection setup phase route destination discovered entry added switching table network node connection passes signaling protocols used allow application specify requirements discover link parameters acceptable values service parameters negotiated routing packet requires node look connection table packet header small needs contain code information length timestamp sequence number different different packets
packet switching networksedit
packet switching used optimize channel capacity available digital telecommunication networks computer networks minimize transmission latency time takes data pass across network increase robustness communication

notable packet switching despite based packet switching methods provided virtual circuits user virtual circuits carry variablelength packets 1978 provided first international commercial packet switching network international packet switched service ipss asynchronous transfer mode also virtual circuit technology uses fixedlength cell relay connection oriented packet switching
datagram packet switching also called connectionless networking connections established technologies multiprotocol label switching mpls resource reservation protocol rsvp create virtual circuits datagram networks virtual circuits especially useful building robust failover mechanisms allocating bandwidth delaysensitive applications
mpls predecessors well called fast packet technologies mpls indeed called without cells20 modern routers however require technologies able forward variablelength packets multigigabit speeds across network
