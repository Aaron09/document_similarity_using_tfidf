etymologyedit
redox portmanteau words reduction oxidation
word oxidation originally implied reaction oxygen form oxide since dioxygen historically first recognized oxidizing agent later term expanded encompass oxygenlike substances accomplished parallel chemical reactions ultimately meaning generalized include processes involving loss electrons
word reduction originally referred loss weight upon heating metallic metal oxide extract metal words reduced metal antoine lavoisier 1743–1794 showed loss weight loss oxygen later scientists realized metal atom gains electrons process meaning reduction became generalized include processes involving gain electrons even though reduction seems counterintuitive speaking gain electrons might help think reduction loss oxygen historical meaning since electrons negatively charged also helpful think reduction electrical charge
electrochemist john bockris used words electronation deelectronation describe reduction oxidation processes respectively occur electrodes4 words analogous protonation deprotonation widely adopted chemists
term hydrogenation could used instead reduction since hydrogen reducing agent large number reactions especially organic chemistry biochemistry unlike oxidation generalized beyond root element hydrogenation maintained specific connection reactions hydrogen another substance hydrogenation unsaturated fats saturated fats r−chch−r r−ch2−ch2−r word redox first used 19285
definitionsedit
processes oxidation reduction occur simultaneously cannot happen independently another similar acid–base reaction3 oxidation alone reduction alone called halfreaction halfreactions always occur together form whole reaction writing halfreactions gained lost electrons typically included explicitly order halfreaction balanced respect electric charge
though sufficient many purposes general descriptions precisely correct although oxidation reduction properly refer change oxidation state actual transfer electrons never occur oxidation state atom fictitious charge atom would bonds atoms different elements ionic thus oxidation best defined increase oxidation state reduction decrease oxidation state practice transfer electrons always cause change oxidation state many reactions classed redox even though electron transfer occurs involving covalent bonds
