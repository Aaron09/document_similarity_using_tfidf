following theories explain fluctuations exchange rates floating exchange rate regime fixed exchange rate regime rates decided government

international parity conditions relative purchasing power parity interest rate parity domestic fisher effect international fisher effect though extent theories provide logical explanation fluctuations exchange rates theories falter based challengeable assumptions free flow goods services capital seldom hold true real world
balance payments model model however focuses largely tradable goods services ignoring increasing role global capital flows failed provide explanation continuous appreciation dollar 1980s 1990s despite soaring current account deficit
asset market model views currencies important asset class constructing investment portfolios asset prices influenced mostly peoples willingness hold existing quantities assets turn depends expectations future worth assets asset market model exchange rate determination states “the exchange rate currencies represents price balances relative supplies demand assets denominated currencies”

none models developed succeed explain exchange rates volatility longer time frames shorter time frames less days algorithms devised predict prices understood models many macroeconomic factors affect exchange rates currency prices result dual forces demand supply worlds currency markets viewed huge melting large everchanging current events supply demand factors constantly shifting price currency relation another shifts accordingly market encompasses distills much going world given time foreign exchange74
