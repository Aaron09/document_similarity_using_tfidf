bronze alloy consisting primarily copper commonly often addition metals aluminium manganese nickel zinc sometimes nonmetals metalloids arsenic phosphorus silicon additions produce range alloys harder copper alone useful properties stiffness ductility machinability
archeological period bronze hardest metal widespread known bronze ancient near east began rise sumer millennium india china starting bronze around time everywhere gradually spread across regions bronze followed iron starting 1300 reaching eurasia though bronze continued much widely used modern times
historical pieces often made brasses copper zinc bronzes different compositions modern museum scholarly descriptions older objects increasingly inclusive term copper alloy instead1

historyedit




hoard bronze socketed axes bronze found modern germany tool period also seems used store value


discovery bronze enabled people create metal objects harder durable previously possible bronze tools weapons armor building materials decorative tiles harder durable stone copper chalcolithic predecessors initially bronze made copper arsenic forming arsenic bronze naturally artificially mixed ores copper arsenic6 earliest artifacts known coming iranian plateau millennium bce7 later used becoming major noncopper ingredient bronze late millennium
bronze superior arsenic bronze alloying process could easily controlled resulting alloy stronger easier cast also unlike arsenic metallic fumes refining toxic earliest tinalloy bronze dates 4500 vinča culture site pločnik serbia9 early examples date late millennium egypt10 susa iran ancient sites china luristan iran mesopotamia iraqcitation needed
ores copper rarer often found together exceptions include ancient site thailand iran serious bronze work always involved trade sources trade ancient times major influence development cultures europe major source british deposits cornwall traded phoenicia eastern mediterranean

transition ironedit
though bronze generally harder wrought iron vickers hardness 60–258 30–8011 bronze gave iron serious disruption trade population migrations around 1200–1100 reduced shipping around mediterranean britain limiting supplies raising prices12 working iron improved iron became cheaper improved quality cultures advanced handwrought iron machineforged iron typically made trip hammers powered water blacksmiths learned make steel steel stronger bronze holds sharper edge longer13
bronze still used iron continued many purposes modern

bronzes typically ductile alloys comparison bronzes considerably less brittle cast iron typically bronze oxidizes superficially copper oxide eventually becoming copper carbonate layer formed underlying metal protected corrosion seen statues hellenistic period however copper chlorides formed corrosionmode called bronze disease eventually completely destroy it21 copperbased alloys lower melting points steel iron readily produced constituent metals generally percent denser steel although alloys using aluminium silicon slightly less dense bronze better conductor heat electricity steels cost copperbase alloys generally higher steels lower nickelbase alloys
copper alloys huge variety uses reflect versatile physical mechanical chemical properties common examples high electrical conductivity pure copper lowfriction properties bearing bronze bronze high lead content— resonant qualities bell bronze copper resistance corrosion seawater several bronze alloys
melting point bronze varies depending ratio alloy components 1742 bronze usually nonmagnetic certain alloys containing iron nickel magnetic properties
varieties fitnessedit
bronze bronzelike alloys mixtures used coins longer period bronze especially suitable boat ship fittings prior wide employment stainless steel owing combination toughness resistance salt water corrosion bronze still commonly used ship propellers submerged bearings
20th century silicon introduced primary alloying element creating alloy wide application industry major form used contemporary statuary sculptors prefer silicon bronze ready availability silicon bronze brazing allows colourmatched repair defects castings aluminium also used structural metal aluminium bronze
also widely used casting bronze sculptures many common bronze alloys unusual desirable property expanding slightly thus filling finest details mould bronze parts tough typically used bearings clips electrical connectors springs
