older classification gastropods four subclasses25

opisthobranchia gills right behind heart

prosobranchia gills front heart
pulmonata lung instead gills

taxonomy gastropoda still revision taxonomy abandoned results studies slowly become clearer nevertheless older terms opisthobranch prosobranch still sometimes used descriptive
insights based sequencing gastropods produced revolutionary taxonomic insights case gastropoda taxonomy gradually rewritten embody strictly monophyletic groups lineage gastropods group integrating findings working taxonomy remain challenging consistent ranks within taxonomy level subclass superorder order suborder already abandoned unworkable ongoing revisions higher taxonomic levels expected near future
convergent evolution appears exist especially high frequency gastropods account observed differences older phylogenies based morphological data recent genesequencing studies
bouchet rocroi 2005326 made sweeping changes systematics resulting taxonomy step closer evolutionary history phylum bouchet rocroi classification system based partly older systems classification partly cladistic research
past taxonomy gastropods largely based phenetic morphological characters taxa recent advances based molecular characters dna27 research made taxonomical ranks hierarchy controversial debate issues likely soon
