anatomy larval tunicate



ascidians almost hermaphrodites single ovary testis either near body wall solitary species sperm eggs shed larvae planktonic others especially colonial species sperm released water drawn atria individuals incoming water current fertilization takes place eggs brooded early developmental stages24 larval forms appear much like primitive chordates notochord stiffening superficially resemble small tadpoles swim undulations tail simple ocellus balancing organ statocyst31
sufficiently developed larva sessile species finds suitable rock cements place larval form capable feeding though rudimentary digestive system31 dispersal mechanism many physical changes occur tunicates body metamorphosis significant reduction cerebral ganglion controls movement equivalent vertebrate brain comes common saying squirt eats brain32 however adult possess cerebral ganglion even larger embrionic stage scientific validity joke questionable33 classes adults remain pelagic swimming drifting open although larvae undergo similar metamorphoses higher lower degree24 colonial forms also increase size colony budding individuals share tunic34
pyrosome colonies grow budding zooids near posterior colony sexual reproduction starts within zooid internally fertilized develops directly oozooid without intervening larval form buds precociously form four blastozooids become detached single unit oozoid disintegrates atrial siphon oozoid becomes exhalent siphon fourzooid colony5
