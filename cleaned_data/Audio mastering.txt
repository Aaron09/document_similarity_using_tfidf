magnetic tape commonly used create master copies


mastering form audio post production process preparing transferring recorded audio source containing final data storage device master source copies produced methods pressing duplication replication recent years digital masters become usual although analog masters audio tapes still used manufacturing industry notably engineers chosen specialize analog mastering
mastering requires critical listening however software tools exist facilitate process results still depend upon intent engineer accuracy speaker monitors listening environment mastering engineers also need apply corrective equalization dynamic compression order optimise sound translation playback systems1 standard practice make copy master recording known safety copy case master lost damaged stolen

historyedit
pre1940sedit
earliest days recording industry phases recording mastering process entirely achieved mechanical processes performers sang andor played large acoustic horn master recording created direct transfer acoustic energy diaphragm recording horn mastering lathe typically located adjoining room cutting head driven energy transferred horn inscribed modulated groove surface rotating cylinder disc2 masters usually made either soft metal alloy gave rise colloquial term waxing referring cutting record3
introduction microphone electronic amplifier mid1920s mastering process became electromechanical electrically driven mastering lathes came cutting master discs cylinder format superseded introduction tape recording master recordings almost always directtodisc2 small minority recordings mastered using previously recorded material sourced discs
emergence magnetic tapeedit
late 1940s recording industry revolutionized introduction magnetic tape magnetic tape invented recording sound fritz pfleumer 1928 germany based invention magnetic wire recording valdemar poulsen 1898 world could technology found outside europe introduction magnetic tape recording enabled master discs separately time space actual recording process2
although tape technical advances dramatically improved audio quality commercial recordings postwar years basic constraints electromechanical mastering process remained inherent physical limitations main commercial recording media—the disc later 7inch single 3313 record—meant audio quality dynamic rangea running timeb master discs still limited compared later media compact disc
electromechanical mastering processedit
1950s advent digital recording late 1970s mastering process typically went several stages studio recording multitrack tape complete final prepared dubbed master tape usually either singletrack mono twotrack stereo tape prior cutting master disc master tape often subjected electronic treatment specialist mastering engineer advent tape found especially recordings master recordings could made resulting record would sound better done making fine adjustments amplitude sound different frequency bands equalization prior cutting master disc
record mastering became highly prized skilled craft widely recognized good mastering could make break commercial recording result independent mastering studio born early independent mastering engineers included doug ludwig katz bernie grundman denny purcell2
large recording companies mastering process usually controlled specialist staff technicians conservative work practices companies often reluctant make changes recording production processes—for example slow taking innovations multitrack recordingc install 8track recorders abbey road studios late 1960s decade first commercial 8track recorders installed american independent studios4

1990s electromechanical processes largely superseded digital technology digital recordings stored hard disk drives digital tape transferred digital audio workstation became common many mastering facilities allowing offline manipulation recorded audio graphical user interface although many digital processing tools common mastering also common analog media processing equipment mastering stage1 areas audio benefits drawbacks digital technology compared analog technology still matter debate however field audio mastering debate usually digital versus analog signal processing rather digital technology storage audio1
although optimum level mastering example adjacent picture suggests levels ideal studio engineer render mastering engineer process5 important allow enough headroom mastering engineers work6 reduction headroom mastering engineer resulted loudness commercial recordings7

steps process typically include following

transferring recorded audio tracks digital audio workstation
sequence separate songs tracks appear final release
adjust length silence songs
process sweeten audio maximize sound quality intended medium applying specific vinyl
transfer audio final master format cdrom halfinch reel tape 1630 umatic tape

examples possible actions taken mastering7

editing minor flaws
applying noise reduction eliminate clicks dropouts hiss
adjusting stereo width
adding ambience
equalize audio across tracks purpose optimized frequency distribution
adjust volume
dynamic range compression expansion
peak limit
dither

finish mastering track markers must inserted along international standard recording code isrc information necessary replicate vinyl cassettes preduplication requirements finished master

running times constrained diameter disc density grooves could inscribed surface without cutting
multitrack recording signal input recorded track multitrack recorder multitrack tape mixed mono stereo tape master tape copied multitrack tape remixed many times different ways different engineers giving possibility several masters mono version stereo version version radio version single version
