marginalism economic designs values costs revenues productivity determined significance last unit added subtracted total
time structure production consumption decisions save reflect time preferences regarding consumption immediate distant indefinite future investments made view larger outputs expected obtained timetaking production processes undertaken

hayek pointed inflationary stimulation exploits increase money supply consequent increase prices goods services

since inflation however modest first help employment long accelerates adopted means reducing unemployment length time accelerates mild steady inflation cannot help—it lead outright inflation inflation constant rate soon ceases stimulating effect merely leaves backlog delayed adaptations conclusive argument mild inflation represented beneficial even standard economics textbooks63
