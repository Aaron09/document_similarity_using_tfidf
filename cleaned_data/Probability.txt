objectivists assign numbers describe objective physical state affairs popular version objective probability frequentist probability claims probability random event denotes relative frequency occurrence experiments outcome repeating experiment interpretation considers probability relative frequency long outcomes6 modification propensity probability interprets probability tendency experiment yield certain outcome even performed
subjectivists assign numbers subjective probability degree belief7 degree belief interpreted price would sell pays unit utility popular version subjective probability bayesian probability includes expert knowledge well experimental data produce probabilities expert knowledge represented subjective prior probability distribution data incorporated likelihood function product prior likelihood normalized results posterior probability distribution incorporates information known date9 aumanns agreement theorem bayesian agents whose prior beliefs similar similar posterior beliefs however sufficiently different priors lead different conclusions regardless much information agents share10
