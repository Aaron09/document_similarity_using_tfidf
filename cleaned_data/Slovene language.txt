orthography thus underdifferentiates several phonemic distinctions

stress vowel length tone distinguished except optional diacritics necessary distinguish similar words different meaning
distinct midvowels also distinguished written simply
schwa also written however combination written simply consonants thus distinguishable
vocalised written cannot predictably distinguished position

tonemic varieties slovene ambiguity even worse final syllable stand although rare
reader expected gather interpretation word context examples

diacriticsedit
compensate shortcomings standard orthography slovene also uses standardized diacritics accent marks denote stress vowel length pitch accent much like closely related serbocroatian however serbocroatian accent marks restricted dictionaries language textbooks linguistic publications normal writing diacritics almost never used except minimal pairs real ambiguity could arise
different mutually incompatible systems diacritics used first simpler nontonemic system applied slovene dialects widely used standard representation dictionaries sskj tonemic system also includes tone part representation however neither system reliably distinguishes schwa front midvowels vocalised regular sources write respectively common
nontonemic diacriticsedit
nontonemic system distinction midvowels indicated well placement stress length vowels

long stressed vowels notated acute diacritic
however rarer long stressed lowmid vowels notated circumflex
short stressed vowels notated grave systems also include

tonemic diacriticsedit
tonemic system uses diacritics somewhat differently nontonemic system highmid vowels written subscript lowmid vowels written plain
pitch accent length indicated four diacritical marks

acute indicates long pitch
inverted breve circumflex indicates long high pitch
grave indicates short pitch occurs optionally written
double grave indicates short high pitch also used optionally written

schwa vowel written ambiguously accentuation sometimes distinguish long vowel mark never appear schwa grave accent appear schwa thus unstressed truly ambiguous
