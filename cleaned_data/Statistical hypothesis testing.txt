testing processedit
statistics literature statistical hypothesis testing plays fundamental role5 usual line reasoning follows

initial research hypothesis truth unknown
first step state relevant null alternative hypotheses important misstating hypotheses muddy rest process
second step consider statistical assumptions made sample test example assumptions statistical independence form distributions observations equally important invalid assumptions mean results test invalid
decide test appropriate state relevant test statistic
derive distribution test statistic null hypothesis assumptions standard cases wellknown result example test statistic might follow students distribution normal distribution
select significance level probability threshold null hypothesis rejected common values
distribution test statistic null hypothesis partitions possible values null hypothesis rejected—the socalled critical region—and probability critical region
compute observations observed value tobs test statistic
decide either reject null hypothesis favor alternative reject decision rule reject null hypothesis observed value tobs critical region accept fail reject hypothesis otherwise

alternative process commonly used

compute observations observed value tobs test statistic
calculate pvalue probability null hypothesis sampling test statistic least extreme observed
reject null hypothesis favor alternative hypothesis pvalue less significance level selected probability threshold

processes equivalent6 former process advantageous past tables test statistics common probability thresholds available allowed decision made without calculation probability adequate classwork operational deficient reporting results
latter process relied extensive tables computational support always available explicit calculation probability useful reporting calculations trivially performed appropriate software
difference processes applied radioactive suitcase example

geigercounter reading limit check suitcase
geigercounter reading high safe suitcases lower readings limit check suitcase

former report adequate latter gives detailed explanation data reason suitcase checked
important note difference accepting null hypothesis simply failing reject fail reject terminology highlights fact null hypothesis assumed true start test lack evidence simply continues assumed true phrase accept null hypothesis suggest proved simply disproved logical fallacy known argument ignorance unless test particularly high power used idea accepting null hypothesis dangerous nonetheless terminology prevalent throughout statistics meaning actually intended well understood
processes described perfectly adequate computation seriously neglect design experiments considerations78
particularly critical appropriate sample sizes estimated conducting experiment
phrase test significance coined statistician ronald fisher9
interpretationedit
pvalue less required significance level equivalently observed test statistic critical region null hypothesis rejected given level significance rejection null hypothesis conclusion like guilty verdict criminal trial evidence sufficient reject innocence thus proving guilt might accept alternative hypothesis research hypothesis
pvalue less required significance level equivalently observed test statistic outside critical region test result evidence insufficient support conclusion like jury fails reach verdict researcher typically gives extra consideration cases pvalue close significance level
people find helpful think hypothesis testing framework analogous mathematical proof contradiction10
lady tasting example fisher required lady properly categorize cups justify conclusion result unlikely result chance defined critical region case alone region defined probability null hypothesis correct less
whether rejection null hypothesis truly justifies acceptance research hypothesis depends structure hypotheses rejecting hypothesis large print originated bear immediately prove existence bigfoot hypothesis testing emphasizes rejection based probability rather acceptance requires extra steps logic
probability rejecting null hypothesis function five factors whether test tailed level significance standard deviation amount deviation null hypothesis number observations11 factors source criticism factors control experimenteranalyst give results appearance subjectivity
importanceedit
statistics helpful analyzing collections data equally true hypothesis testing justify conclusions even scientific theory exists lady tasting example obvious difference existed milk poured poured milk data contradicted obvious
real world applications hypothesis testing include12

testing whether women suffer nightmares
establishing authorship documents
evaluating effect full moon behavior
determining range detect insect echo
deciding whether hospital carpeting results infections
selecting best means stop smoking
checking whether bumper stickers reflect owner behavior
testing claims handwriting analysts

statistical hypothesis testing plays important role whole statistics statistical inference example lehmann 1992 review fundamental paper neyman pearson 1933 says nevertheless despite shortcomings paradigm formulated 1933 paper many developments carried within framework continue play central role theory practice statistics expected foreseeable future
significance testing favored statistical tool experimental social sciences articles journal applied psychology early 1990s13 fields favored estimation parameters effect size significance testing used substitute traditional comparison predicted value experimental result core scientific method theory capable predicting sign relationship directional onesided hypothesis test configured statistically significant result supports theory form theory appraisal heavily criticized application hypothesis testing
cautionsedit
government required statistical procedures carry warning labels like drugs inference methods would long labels indeed14 caution applies hypothesis tests alternatives
successful hypothesis test associated probability typei error rate conclusion might wrong
conclusion test solid sample upon based design experiment critical number unexpected effects observed including

clever hans effect horse appeared capable simple arithmetic
hawthorne effect industrial workers productive better illumination productive worse
placebo effect pills medically active ingredients remarkably effective

statistical analysis misleading data produces misleading conclusions issue data quality subtle forecasting example agreement measure forecast accuracy absence consensus measurement decision based measurements without controversy
book statistics1516 popular book statistics ever published17 much consider hypothesis testing cautions applicable including many claims made basis samples small convince report mention sample size doubtful
hypothesis testing acts filter statistical conclusions results meeting probability threshold publishable economics also acts publication filter results favorable author funding source submitted publication impact filtering publication termed publication bias related problem multiple testing sometimes linked data mining variety tests variety possible effects applied single data yielding significant result reported often dealt using multiplicity correction procedures control family wise error rate fwer false discovery rate

fisher popularized significance test required nullhypothesis corresponding population frequency distribution sample familiar calculations determined whether reject nullhypothesis significance testing utilize alternative hypothesis concept type error
pvalue devised informal objective index meant help researcher determine based knowledge whether modify future experiments strengthen ones faith null hypothesis25 hypothesis testing type errors devised neyman pearson objective alternative fishers pvalue also meant determine researcher behaviour without requiring inductive inference researcher2627
