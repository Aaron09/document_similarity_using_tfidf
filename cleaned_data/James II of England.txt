macaulay wrote whig tradition






belloc notable apologist james


historical analysis james somewhat revised since whig historians lord macaulay cast james cruel absolutist reign tyranny approached insanity144 subsequent scholars trevelyan macaulays greatnephew david balanced macaulay still characterised james tyrant attempts religious tolerance fraud reign aberration course british history145 1892 ward wrote dictionary national biography james obviously political religious bigot although never devoid vein patriotic sentiment conversion church rome made emancipation fellowcatholics first instance recovery england catholicism second governing objects policy146
hilaire belloc writer catholic apologist broke tradition 1928 casting james honourable true advocate freedom conscience enemies small clique great fortunes destroyed ancient monarchy english147 however observed james concluded catholic church sole authoritative voice earth thenceforward stood firm surrender single occasion contemplated least compromise word would modify impression made 1960s 1970s maurice ashley stuart prall began reconsider jamess motives granting religious toleration still taking note jamess autocratic rule148 modern historians moved away school thought preached continuous march progress democracy ashley contending history story human beings individuals well classes masses149 cast james william ideals well human weaknesses149 john miller writing 2000 accepted claims jamess absolutism argued main concern secure religious liberty civil equality catholics absolutist methods essentially means end150 2004 speck wrote oxford dictionary national biography james genuinely committed religious toleration also sought increase power crown151 added unlike government netherlands james autocratic combine freedom conscience popular government resisted check monarchs power heart concessions make 1688 would rather live exile principles intact continue reign limited monarch151
harriss conclusions 2006 book summarised ambivalence modern scholarship towards james

jury doubtless remain james long time egotistical bigot tyrant rode roughshod vast majority subjects least england scotland simply naïve even perhaps plain stupid unable appreciate realities political power wellintentioned even enlightened ruler—an enlightened despot well ahead time perhaps—who merely trying thought best subjects152

2009 steven pincus confronted scholarly ambivalence 1688 first modern revolution pincus claims jamess reign must understood within context economic change european politics makes major assertions james first james purposefully followed french king louis trying create modern catholic polity involved trying catholicize england also creating modern centralizing extremely bureaucratic state apparatus153 second james undone 1688 less protestant reaction catholicization nationwide hostile reaction intrusive bureaucratic state taxation apparatus expressed massive popular support william oranges armed invasion england pincus presents james neither naïve stupid egotistical instead readers shown intelligent clearthinking strategically motivated monarch whose vision french authoritarian political model alliance clashed lost alternative views favoured entrepreneurial dutch economic model feared french power outraged jamess authoritarianism
scott sowerby countered pincuss thesis 2013 making toleration repealers glorious revolution noted english taxes remained james reign english national income thus unlikely james could built bureaucratic state model louis xivs france taxes least twice high proportion gdp154 sowerby also contends jamess policies religious toleration attracted substantial support religious nonconformists including quakers baptists congregationalists presbyterians attracted kings push magna carta liberty conscience155 king overthrown sowerbys view largely fears among dutch english elites james might aligning louis supposed holy league destroy protestantism across northern europe156 sowerby presents jamess reign struggle believed king sincerely devoted liberty conscience sceptical kings espousals toleration believed hidden agenda overthrow english protestantism
