first part linguascale decimal classification referred consisting linguasphere numerals denoting relevant phylozone geozone provides systematic numerical initial classification worlds languages following principles linguasphere register first numeral represents referential sectors worlds languages initially divided sector either phylosector constituent languages considered diachronic relationship another geosector languages grouped geographically rather historically
second numeral used represent zones geosector divided referential purposes component zones like sectors described either phylozones geozones based nature relationship among constituent languages either historical geographical
second part linguascale consists three capital letters majuscules zone divided sets represented first majuscule threeletter alpha3 component divided chains represented second majuscule chain nets represented third majuscule division languages zone sets chains nets based relative degrees linguistic proximity measured principle approximate proportions shared basic vocabulary geozones average divided sets phylozones relationships among languages within latter definition obvious much closer
third final part linguascale consists three lowercase letters minuscules used identify language dialect precision first letter sequence represents outer unit preferred 2010 original term outer language avoid shifting often emotive applications terms language dialect inner units language varieties comprise outer language coded using second wherever necessary third minuscule letter
