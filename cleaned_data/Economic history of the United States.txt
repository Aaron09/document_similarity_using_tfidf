iron industryedit
important technological innovation 19th century iron production adoption blast developed patented scotland 1828 blast method using heat blast furnace exhaust preheat combustion saving considerable amount fuel allowed much higher furnace temperatures increased capacity furnaces
blast allowed blast furnaces anthracite lower grade coal anthracite difficult light cold blast high quality metallurgical coking coal deposits sufficient size iron making available great britain western germany 19th century122 less fuel required unit iron possible lower grade coal
anthracite rather short lived size blast furnaces increased enormously toward century forcing coke porous impede upflow gases furnace charcoal would crushed column material tall furnaces also capacity furnaces would eventually exceeded wood supply happened locomotives123
