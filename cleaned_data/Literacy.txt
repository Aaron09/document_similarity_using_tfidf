origins alphabetedit
according social anthropologist jack goody interpretations regard origin alphabet many classical scholars historian ignace gelb credit ancient greeks creating first alphabetic system used distinctive signs consonants vowels goody contests importance greek culture subsequent history western europe overemphasis classicists others addition specific vowel signs consonantal ones developed earlier western asia9
thus many scholars argue ancient semiticspeaking peoples northern canaan modernday syria invented consonantal alphabet early 1500 much theorys development credited english archeologist flinders petrie 1905 came across series canaanite inscriptions located turquoise mines serabit elkhadem years later english egyptologist alan gardiner reasoned letters contain alphabet well references canaanite goddess asherah 1948 william albright deciphered text using additional evidence discovered subsequent goodys findings included series inscriptions ugarit discovered 1929 french archaeologist claude schaeffer inscriptions mythological texts written early canaanite dialect consisted 32letter cuneiform consonantal alphabet
another significant discovery made 1953 three arrowheads uncovered containing identical canaanite inscriptions twelfth century according frank moore cross inscriptions consisted alphabetic signs originated transitional development pictographic script linear alphabet moreover asserts inscriptions also provided clues extend decipherment earlier later alphabetic texts10
consonantal system canaanite language inspired alphabetical developments subsequent languages late bronze successor alphabets appeared throughout mediterranean region subdeveloped three languages phoenician hebrew aramaic
according goody cuneiform scripts influenced development greek alphabet several centuries later historically greeks contended language modeled phoenicians however many semitic scholars believe ancient greek consistent early form canaanite used 1100 earliest greek inscriptions dated eighth century epigraphical comparisons protocanaanite suggest greeks adopted language early 1100 later added five characters represent vowels11
phoenician considered contain first linear alphabet rapidly spread mediterranean port cities northern canaan10 archeologists believe phoenician scripture influence developments hebrew aramaic alphabets based fact languages evolved time period share similar features commonly categorized language group12
