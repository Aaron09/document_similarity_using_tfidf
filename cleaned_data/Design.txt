definitionsedit
formally design defined follows

noun specification object manifested agent intended accomplish goals particular environment using primitive components satisfying requirements subject constraints verb transitive create design environment designer operates3

another definition design roadmap strategic approach someone achieve unique expectation defines specifications plans parameters costs activities processes within legal political social environmental safety economic constraints achieving objective4
specification manifested either plan finished product primitives elements design object composed
broad denotation universal language unifying institution designers disciplines allows many differing philosophies approaches toward subject philosophies studies design
person designing called designer also term used people work professionally various design areas usually specifying area dealt fashion designer concept designer designer interior designer designers sequence activities called design process scientific study design called design science5678
another definition design planning manufacture object system component structure thus word design used noun verb broader sense design applied engineering integrate technology
definition design fairly broad design myriad specifications professionals utilize fields
design processedit
substantial disagreement exists concerning designers many fields whether amateur professional alone teams produce designs kees dorst judith dijkhuis designers argued many ways describing design processes discussed basic fundamentally different ways9 several names prevailing view called rational model10 technical problem solving11 reasoncentric perspective12 alternative view called reflectioninaction11 evolutionary design8 coevolution13 actioncentric perspective12
rational modeledit
rational model independently developed herbert simon14 american scientist gerhard pahl wolfgang beitz german engineering design theorists15 posits

designers attempt optimize design candidate known constraints objectives
design process plandriven
design process understood terms discrete sequence stages

rational model based rationalist philosophy10 underlies waterfall model16 systems development life cycle17 much engineering design literature18 according rationalist philosophy design informed research knowledge predictable controlled manner
example sequence stagesedit
typical stages consistent rational model include following

preproduction design

design brief parti pris early often beginning statement design goals
analysis analysis current design goals
research investigating similar design solutions field related topics
specification specifying requirements design solution product product design specification19 service
problem solving conceptualizing documenting design solutions
presentation presenting design solutions


design production

development continuation improvement designed solution
testing situ testing designed solution


postproduction design feedback future designs

implementation introducing designed solution environment
evaluation conclusion summary process results including constructive criticism suggestions future improvements


redesign stages design process repeated corrections made time production

stage many associated best practices20
criticism rational modeledit
rational model widely criticized primary grounds

designers work extensive empirical evidence demonstrated designers rational model suggests21
unrealistic assumptions goals often unknown design project begins requirements constraints continue change22

actioncentric modeledit
actioncentric perspective label given collection interrelated concepts antithetical rational model12 posits

designers creativity emotion generate design candidates
design process improvised
universal sequence stages apparent analysis design implementation contemporary inextricably linked12

actioncentric perspective based empiricist philosophy broadly consistent agile approach23 amethodical development24 substantial empirical evidence supports veracity perspective describing actions real designers21 like rational model actioncentric model sees design informed research knowledge however research knowledge brought design process judgment common sense designers designers thinking feet predictable controlled process stipulated rational model
descriptions design activitiesedit
least views design activity consistent actioncentric perspective involve three basic activities
reflectioninaction paradigm designers alternate framing making moves evaluating moves framing refers conceptualizing problem defining goals objectives move tentative design decision evaluation process lead moves design11
sensemaking–coevolution–implementation framework designers alternate three titular activities sensemaking includes framing evaluating moves implementation process constructing design object coevolution process design agent simultaneously refines mental picture design object based mental picture context vice versa25
concept design cycle understood circular time structure26 start thinking idea expressing visual verbal means communication design tools sharing perceiving expressed idea finally starting cycle critical rethinking perceived idea anderson points concept emphasizes importance means expression time means perception design ideas27

philosophies studies designedit
countless philosophies guiding design design values accompanying aspects within modern design vary different schools thoughtwhich among practicing designers28 design philosophies usually determining design goals design goal range solving least significant individual problem smallest element holistic influential utopian goals design goals usually guiding design however conflicts immediate minor goals lead questioning purpose design perhaps better long term ultimate goals john heskett 20thcentury british writer design claimed design stripped essence defined human nature shape make environment ways without precedent nature serve needs give meaning lives29
philosophies guiding designedit
design philosophies fundamental guiding principles dictate designer approaches hisher practice reflections material culture environmental concerns sustainable design guide design philosophy example first things first manifesto launched within graphic design community states propose reversal priorities favor useful lasting democratic forms communication mindshift away product marketing toward exploration production kind meaning scope debate shrinking must expand consumerism running uncontested must challenged perspectives expressed part visual languages resources design30
sciences artificial polymath herbert simon author asserts design metadiscipline professions engineers professional designers everyone designs devises courses action aimed changing existing situations preferred ones intellectual activity produces material artifacts different fundamentally prescribes remedies sick patient devises sales plan company social welfare policy state design construed core professional training principal mark distinguishes professions sciences schools engineering well schools architecture business education medicine centrally concerned process design31
approaches designedit
design approach general philosophy include guide specific methods guide overall goal design approaches guide tendencies designer combination approaches used dont conflict
popular approaches include

sociotechnical system design philosophy tools participative designing work arrangements supporting processes organizational purpose quality safety economics customer requirements core work processes quality peoples experience work needs society
kiss principle keep simple stupid strives eliminate unnecessary complications
timtowtdi philosophy allow multiple methods thing
usecentered design focuses goals tasks associated artifact rather focusing user
usercentered design focuses needs wants limitations user designed artifact
critical design uses designed artifacts embodied critique commentary existing values morals practices culture
service design designing organizing experience around product service associated products
transgenerational design practice making products environments compatible physical sensory impairments associated human aging limit major activities daily living
speculative design speculative design process doesnt necessarily define specific problem solve establishes provocative starting point design process emerges result evolution fluctuating iteration reflection using designed objects provoke questions stimulate discussion academic research settings

methods designingedit
main article design methods
design methods broad area focuses

exploring possibilities constraints focusing critical thinking skills research define problem spaces existing products services—or creation categories also brainstorming
redefining specifications design solutions lead better guidelines traditional design activities graphic industrial architectural
managing process exploring defining creating artifacts continually time
prototyping possible scenarios solutions incrementally significantly improve inherited situation
trendspotting understanding trend process

terminologyedit
word design often considered ambiguous applied varying contexts

jonathan received several awards design apple products like macbook design fields personal computers also used design production


design productionedit
relationship design production planning executing theory plan anticipate compensate potential problems execution process design involves problemsolving creativity contrast production involves routine preplanned process design also mere plan include production engineering processes although working knowledge processes usually expected designers cases unnecessary impractical expect designer broad multidisciplinary knowledge required designs also detailed specialized knowledge produce product
design production intertwined many creative professional careers meaning problemsolving part execution reverse cost rearrangement increases need separating design production increases well example highbudget project skyscraper requires separating design architecture production construction lowbudget project locally printed office party invitation flyer rearranged printed dozens times cost sheets paper drops less hours desktop publisher
production never involves problemsolving creativity design always involves creativity designs rarely perfect sometimes repetitive imperfection design task production position production artist construction worker utilizing creativity problemsolving skills compensate overlooked design process likewise design simple repetition copy known preexisting solution requiring minimal creativity problemsolving skills designer
