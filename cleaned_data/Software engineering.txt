establishment sound engineering principles order economically obtain software reliable works efficiently real machines7

term used less formally

informal contemporary term broad range activities formerly called computer programming systems analysis51
broad term aspects practice computer programming opposed theory computer programming called computer science52
term embodying advocacy specific approach computer programming urges treated engineering discipline rather craft advocates codification recommended practices53

criticismedit
software engineering sees practitioners individuals follow welldefined engineering approaches problemsolving approaches specified various software engineering books research papers always connotations predictability precision mitigated risk professionalism perspective calls licensing certification codified bodies knowledge mechanisms spreading engineering knowledge maturing field
software craftsmanship proposed body software developers alternative emphasizes coding skills accountability software developers without professionalism prescribed curriculum leading adhoc problemsolving craftmanship without engineering lack predictability precision missing risk mitigation methods informal poorly defined software craftsmanship manifesto extends agile software manifesto54 draws metaphor modern software development apprenticeship model medieval europe
software engineering extends engineering draws engineering model engineering process engineering project management engineering requirements engineering design engineering construction engineering validation concept rarely understood widely misinterpreted including software engineering textbooks papers among communities programmers crafters
core issues software engineering approaches empirical enough realworld validation approaches usually absent limited hence software engineering often misinterpreted feasible theoretical environment
dijkstra developed computer languages 20th century refuted concepts software engineering prevalent 1980s arguing terms poor analogies called radical novelty computer science

number phenomena bundled name software engineering economics known miserable science software engineering known doomed discipline doomed cannot even approach goal since goal selfcontradictory software engineering course presents another worthy cause eyewash carefully read literature analyse devotees actually discover software engineering accepted charter program cannot55
