roman republic expanded reached point central government rome could effectively rule distant provinces communications transportation especially problematic given vast extent empire news invasion revolt natural disasters epidemic outbreak carried ship mounted postal service often requiring much time reach rome romes orders realized province origin reason provincial governors facto rule name roman republic governors several duties including command armies handling taxes province serving local chief judges2
prior establishment empire territories roman republic divided among members second triumvirate mark antony octavian marcus aemilius lepidus antony received provinces east achaea macedonia epirus roughly modern greece albania coast croatia bithynia pontus asia roughly modern turkey syria cyprus cyrenaica3 lands previously conquered alexander great thus much aristocracy greek origin whole region especially major cities largely assimilated greek culture greek often serving lingua franca

rebellions uprisings political developmentsedit
minor rebellions uprisings fairly common events throughout empire conquered tribes cities would revolt legions would detached crush rebellion process simple peacetime could considerably complicated wartime example great jewish revolt
fullblown military campaign legions generals vespasian numerous ensure commanders loyalty pragmatic emperor might hold members generals family hostage nero effectively held domitian quintus petillius cerialis governor ostia respectively younger brotherinlaw vespasian rule nero ended revolt praetorian guard bribed name galba praetorian guard figurative sword damocles often perceived dubious loyalty following example legions borders increased participation civil wars
main enemy west arguably germanic tribes behind rivers rhine danube augustus tried conquer ultimately pulled back teutoburg reversal
parthian empire east hand remote powerful conquered parthian invasion confronted usually defeated similarly parthians repelled attempts roman invasion however even successful wars conquest implemented trajan septimius severus distant territories forsaken prevent unrest also ensure healthy lasting peace persians parthians followed sasanian empire continued hostilities roman empire
controlling western border rome reasonably easy relatively close also disunity germanic foes however controlling frontiers altogether wartime difficult emperor near border east chances high ambitious general would rebel west vice versa wartime opportunism plagued many ruling emperors indeed paved road power several future emperors
