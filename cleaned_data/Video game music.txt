around 1980 arcade games began taking steps toward digitized sampled sounds namcos 1980 arcade game rallyx first known game digitaltoanalog converter produce sampled tones instead tone generator10 year first known video game feature speech synthesis also released sunsofts shoot game stratovox12 around time18 introduction frequency modulation synthesis synthesis first commercially released yamaha digital synthesizers sound chips allowed tones manipulated different sound characteristics tone generated chip limited design chip konamis 1983 arcade game gyruss used five synthesis sound chips along somewhat used create electronic version bachs toccata fugue minor19
beyond arcade games significant improvements personal computer game music made possible introduction digital synth boards yamaha released japanese computers pc8801 pc9801 early 1980s mid1980s pc8801 builtin sound allowed computer game music greater complexity simplistic beeps internal speakers synth boards produced warm pleasant sound musicians yuzo koshiro takeshi utilized produce music still highly regarded within chiptune community20 widespread adoption synthesis consoles would later major advances 16bit time 16bit arcade machines using multiple synthesis chips18
earliest home computers make digital signal processing form sampling commodore amiga 1985 computers sound chip featured four independent 8bit digitaltoanalog converters developers could platform take samples music performance sometimes single note long play back computers sound chip memory differed rallyx hardware used play back simple waveform samples sampled sound allowed complexity authenticity real instrument simulation could offer role first affordable amiga would remain staple tool early sequenced music composing especially europe
amiga offered features competing home computer platforms amigas main rival atari sourced yamaha ym2149 programmable sound generator compared inhouse designed amiga sound engine could handle channel sampled sound needed computers process data made impractical game development 1989 release atari used techniques play back samples however remained relevant equipped midi controller external ports became choice many professional musicians midi programming device
clones 1985 would significant development multimedia abilities years sampling would become popular video game systems several years though sampling potential produce much realistic sounds sample required much data memory time memory solid state cartridge magnetic floppy disk otherwise still costly kilobyte sequenced soundchip generated music hand generated lines comparatively simple code took less precious memory
arcade systems pushed game music forward 1984 introduction frequency modulation synthesis providing realistic sounds previous psgs first game marble madness used yamaha ym2151 synthesis chip21
home consoles moved fourth generation 16bit hybrid approach sampled tone music composing continued used sega genesis offered advanced graphics improved sound synthesis features also using yamaha chip ym261222 largely held approach sound design channels total tone generation samples available stereo instead ness five channels mono often used percussion samples genesis support 16bit sampled sounds despite additional tone channels writing music still posed challenge traditional composers forced much imaginative synthesizer create enjoyable listening experience composer yuzo koshiro utilized genesis hardware effectively produce progressive catchy technostyle compositions advanced players used games revenge shinobi 1989 streets rage series setting high watermark music games could sound like23 soundtrack streets rage 1992 particular considered revolutionary ahead time blend house music dirty electro basslines trancey electronic textures would feel comfortable nightclub video game24 another important synth composer late umemoto composed music many visual novels shoot 1990s25

prerecorded streaming musicedit
main article streaming audio video games
taking entirely prerecorded music many advantages sequencing sound quality music could produced freely kind number instruments allowing developers simply record track played back game quality limited effort mastering track memory space costs previously concern somewhat addressed optical media becoming dominant media software games quality audio allowed music voice potential truly indistinguishable source genre music
fourth generation home video games limited playing mixed mode audio track game play sonic earliest examples mixed mode audio video games include turbografxcd franchises tengai makyō composed ryuichi sakamoto 198927 series composed yuzo koshiro mieko ishikawa arranged yonemitsu 1989 soundtracks particularly 1989 still regarded influential video game music ever composed282930
however several disadvantages regular cdaudio optical drive technology still limited spindle speed playing audio track game meant system could access data stopped track playing looping common form game music also problem laser reached track move back beginning start reading causing audible playback
address drawbacks game developers designed container formats house application cases stream compressed audio would back memory used music allowed much lower latency seek time finding starting play music also allowed much smoother looping able buffer data minor drawback compressed audio meant decompressed load system computing power increased load became minimal cases dedicated chips computer sound card would actually handle decompressing
fifth generation home console systems also developed specialised streaming formats containers compressed audio playback games would take full advantage ability sometimes highly praised results castlevania symphony night games ported arcade machines continued synthesis often superior prerecorded music streams home console counterparts street fighter alpha even though game systems capable quality sound compressed audio tracks true quality many lower sampling rates significant consumers would notice using compressed stream allowed game designers play back streamed music still able access data disc without interruption music cost power used render audio stream manipulating stream would require significant level power available generation

although tones featured music thought emulating traditional fourpiece rock band triangle wave used bass pulse waves analogous guitars white noise channel used drums composers would often compose complex rapid sequences notes part restrictions mentioned similar music composition baroque period composers particularly creating solo pieces focused musical embellishments compensate instruments harpsichord allow expressive dynamics38 reason many early compositions also feature distinct jazz influence would overlap later influences heavy metal jpop music resulting equally distinct compositional style 16bit era38
