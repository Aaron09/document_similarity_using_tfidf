solutions solvationedit

addition mixing substances solution interact molecular level something dissolved molecules solvent arrange around molecules solute heat transfer involved entropy increased making solution thermodynamically stable solute solvent separately arrangement mediated respective chemical properties solvent solute hydrogen bonding dipole moment polarizability2 solvation cause chemical reaction chemical configuration changes solute however solvation resembles coordination complex formation reaction often considerable energetics heat solvation entropy solvation thus neutral process
solvent classificationsedit
solvents broadly classified categories polar nonpolar special case mercury whose solutions known amalgams also metal solutions exist liquid room temperature generally dielectric constant solvent provides rough measure solvents polarity strong polarity water indicated high dielectric constant solvents dielectric constant less generally considered nonpolar4 dielectric constant measures solvents tendency partly cancel field strength electric field charged particle immersed reduction compared field strength charged particle vacuum4 heuristically dielectric constant solvent thought ability reduce solutes effective internal charge generally dielectric constant solvent acceptable predictor solvents ability dissolve common ionic compounds salts
polarity scalesedit
dielectric constants measure polarity solvents used chemists carry chemical reactions observe chemical biological phenomena specific measures polarity required measures sensitive chemical structure
grunwald–winstein scale measures polarity terms solvent influence buildup positive charge solute chemical reaction
kosowers scale measures polarity terms influence solvent uvabsorption maxima salt usually pyridinium iodide pyridinium zwitterion5
donor number donor acceptor scale measures polarity terms solvent interacts specific substances like strong lewis acid strong lewis base6
hildebrand parameter square root cohesive energy density used nonpolar compounds cannot accommodate complex chemistry
reichardts solvatochromic changes color response polarity gives scale et30 values transition energy ground state lowest excited state kcalmol identifies another roughly correlated scale et33 defined nile
polarity dipole moment polarizability hydrogen bonding solvent determines type compounds able dissolve solvents liquid compounds miscible generally polar solvents dissolve polar compounds best nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar compounds best like dissolves like strongly polar compounds like sugars sucrose ionic compounds like inorganic salts table salt dissolve polar solvents like water strongly nonpolar compounds like oils waxes dissolve nonpolar organic solvents like hexane similarly water hexane vinegar vegetable miscible quickly separate layers even shaken well
polarity separated different contributions example kamlettaft parameters dipolaritypolarizability hydrogenbonding acidity hydrogenbonding basicity calculated wavelength shifts different solvatochromic dyes solvent usually including reichardts nitroaniline diethylnitroaniline another option hansens parameters separate cohesive energy density dispersion polar hydrogen bonding contributions

safetyedit
fireedit
organic solvents flammable highly flammable depending volatility exceptions chlorinated solvents like dichloromethane chloroform mixtures solvent vapors explode solvent vapors heavier sink bottom travel large distances nearly undiluted solvent vapors also found supposedly empty drums cans posing flash fire hazard hence empty containers volatile solvents stored open upside
diethyl ether carbon disulfide exceptionally autoignition temperatures increase greatly fire risk associated solvents autoignition temperature carbon disulfide objects steam pipes light bulbs hotplates recentlyextinguished bunsen burners able ignite vapours
addition solvents methanol burn flame nearly invisible lighting conditions1314 delay prevent timely recognition dangerous fire flames spread materials
explosive peroxide formationedit
ethers like diethyl ether tetrahydrofuran form highly explosive organic peroxides upon exposure oxygen light normally likely form peroxides diethyl ether susceptible solvents diisopropyl ether ethers considered potential peroxide sources
heteroatom oxygen stabilizes formation free radical formed abstraction hydrogen atom another free radicalclarification needed carboncentred free radical thus formed able react oxygen molecule form peroxide compound process peroxide formation greatly accelerated exposure even levels light proceed slowly even dark conditions
unless desiccant used destroy peroxides concentrate distillation higher boiling point sufficient peroxides formed form crystalline shocksensitive solid precipitate minor mechanical disturbances scraping inside vessel dislodging deposit violent explosion
cases peroxides spontaneously precipitate concentrated crystalline solids within storage container ether solid formed mouth bottle merely twisting provide sufficient energy peroxide detonate peroxide formation significant problem fresh solvents used quickly problem laboratories take years finish single bottle lowvolume users acquire small amounts peroxideprone solvents dispose solvents regular periodic schedule
ethers best stored dark closed canisters presence stabilizers like butylated hydroxytoluene sodium hydroxide desiccantcitation needed
number tests used detect presence peroxide ether combination ironii sulfate potassium thiocyanate peroxide able oxidize forms deepred coordination complex thiocyanate
peroxides removed washing acidic ironii sulfate filtering alumina distilling sodiumbenzophenone alumina destroy peroxides merely traps must disposed properly advantage using sodiumbenzophenone moisture oxygen removed well
health effectsedit
general health hazards associated solvent exposure include toxicity nervous system reproductive damage liver kidney damage respiratory impairment cancer dermatitis15

many solvents lead sudden loss consciousness inhaled large amounts solvents like diethyl ether chloroform used medicine anesthetics sedatives hypnotics long time ethanol grain alcohol widely used abused psychoactive drug diethyl ether chloroform many solvents gasoline glues used recreationally glue sniffing often harmful long term health effects like neurotoxicity cancer fraudulent substitution 15pentanediol psychoactive 14butanediol subcontractor caused bindeez product recall
ingested alcohols ethanol methanol propanol ethylene glycol metabolize toxic aldehydes acids cause potentially fatal metabolic acidosis thus commonly available alcohol solvent methanol cause permanent blindness death ingested solvent 2butoxyethanol used fracking fluids cause hypotension metabolic acidosis16
chronic exposureedit
main article chronic solventinduced encephalopathy
solvents including chloroform benzene common ingredient gasoline known carcinogenic many others considered world health organization likely carcinogens solvents damage internal organs like liver kidneys nervous system brain cumulative effects longterm repeated exposure solvents called chronic solventinduced encephalopathy
chronic exposure organic solvents work environment produce range adverse neuropsychiatric effects example occupational exposure organic solvents associated higher numbers painters suffering alcoholism17 ethanol synergistic effect taken combination many solvents instance combination toluenebenzene ethanol causes greater nauseavomiting either substance alone
many solvents known suspected cataractogenic greatly increasing risk developing cataracts lens eye18 solvent exposure also associated neurotoxic damage causing hearing loss1920 color vision losses21
environmental contaminationedit
major pathway induce health effects arises spills leaks solvents reach underlying soil since solvents readily migrate substantial distances creation widespread soil contamination uncommon particularly health risk aquifers affected 5000 sites worldwide major subsurface solvent contaminationcitation needed
