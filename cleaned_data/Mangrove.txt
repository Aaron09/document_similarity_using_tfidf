mangrove swamps found tropical subtropical tidal areas areas mangal occurs include estuaries marine shorelines4
intertidal existence trees adapted represents major limitation number species able thrive habitat high tide brings salt water tide recedes solar evaporation seawater soil leads increases salinity return tide flush soils bringing back salinity levels comparable seawater
tide organisms also exposed increases temperature desiccation cooled flooded tide thus plant survive environment must tolerate broad ranges salinity temperature moisture well number environmental factors—thus select species make mangrove tree community
species considered mangroves sense tree grows saline swamp4 though mangrove plant genus rhizophora however given mangrove swamp typically features small number tree species uncommon mangrove forest caribbean feature three four tree species comparison tropical rainforest biome contains thousands tree species mangrove forests lack diversity though trees species ecosystem trees create provides home habitat great variety species
mangrove plants require number physiological adaptations overcome problems anoxia high salinity frequent tidal inundation species solutions problems primary reason shorelines mangrove tree species show distinct zonation small environmental variations within mangal lead greatly differing methods coping environment therefore species partly determined tolerances individual species physical conditions tidal inundation salinity also influenced factors predation plant seedlings crabs
established mangrove roots provide oyster habitat slow water flow thereby enhancing sediment deposition areas already occurring fine anoxic sediments mangroves sinks variety heavy trace metals colloidal particles sediments scavenged water mangrove removal disturbs underlying sediments often creating problems trace metal contamination seawater biota

breathing tubes typically reach heights species four types pneumatophores stilt prop type snorkel type knee type ribbon plank type knee ribbon types combined buttress roots base tree roots also contain wide aerenchyma facilitate transport within plants
limiting salt intakeedit




salt crystals formed grey mangrove leaf


mangroves exclude salt significantly impermeable roots highly suberised impregnated suberin acting ultrafiltration mechanism exclude sodium salts rest plant analysis water inside mangroves shown salt excluded roots frequently cited concept become known sacrificial leaf salt accumulate shoot sprout concentrates leaves plant sheds however recent research suggests older yellowing leaves measurable salt content greener leaves18 mangroves also store salt cell vacuoles seen photograph right white grey mangroves secrete salts directly salt glands leaf base correlating name—they covered white salt crystals
limiting water lossedit
limited fresh water available salty intertidal soils mangroves limit amount water lose leaves restrict opening stomata pores leaf surfaces exchange carbon dioxide water vapour photosynthesis also vary orientation leaves avoid harsh midday reduce evaporation leaves anthony calfo noted aquarium author observed anecdotally mangrove captivity grows leaves misted fresh water several times week simulating frequent tropical rainstorms19
nutrient uptakeedit
soil perpetually waterlogged little free oxygen available anaerobic bacteria liberate nitrogen soluble ferrum iron inorganic phosphates sulfides methane make soil much less nutritiouscitation needed pneumatophores aerial roots allow mangroves absorb gases directly atmosphere nutrients iron inhospitable soil mangroves store gases directly inside roots processing even roots submerged high tide
increasing survival offspringedit




mangrove seeds germinate still parent tree


harsh environment mangroves evolved special mechanism help offspring survive mangrove seeds buoyant therefore suited water dispersal unlike plants whose seeds germinate soil many mangroves mangrove viviparous whose seeds germinate still attached parent tree germinated seedling grows either within fruit aegialitis avicennia aegiceras fruit rhizophora ceriops bruguiera nypa form propagule readytogo seedling produce food photosynthesis
mature propagule drops water transport great distances propagules survive desiccation remain dormant year arriving suitable environment propagule ready root density changes elongated shape floats vertically rather horizontally position likely lodge root root alter density drift search favorable conditions
taxonomy evolutionedit
