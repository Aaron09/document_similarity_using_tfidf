main article mass spectrometry
mass spectrometry molecular mass small molecule usually reported monoisotopic mass mass molecule containing common isotope element note also differs subtly molecular mass choice isotopes defined thus single specific molecular mass many possible masses used compute monoisotopic molecular mass found table isotopic masses found typical periodic table average molecular mass often used larger molecules since molecules many atoms unlikely composed exclusively abundant isotope element theoretical average molecular mass calculated using standard atomic weights found typical periodic table since likely statistical distribution atoms representing isotopes throughout molecule however differ true average molecular mass sample natural artificial variations isotopic distributions
hydrodynamic methodsedit
first approximation basis determination molecular weight according mark–houwink relations2 fact intrinsic viscosity solutions suspensions macromolecules depends volumetric proportion dispersed particles particular solvent specifically hydrodynamic size related molecular weight depends conversion factor describing shape particular molecule allows apparent molecular weight described range techniques sensitive hydrodynamic effects including also known viscometry diffusion ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy dosy3 apparent hydrodynamic size used approximate molecular weight using series macromoleculespecific standards4 requires calibration frequently described relative molecular weight determination method
static light scatteringedit
also possible determine absolute molecular weight directly light scattering traditionally using zimm method accomplished either classical static light scattering multiangle light scattering detectors molecular weights determined method require calibration hence term absolute external measurement required refractive index increment describes change refractive index concentration
