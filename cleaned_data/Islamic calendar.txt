main article preislamic calendar
central arabia especially mecca lack epigraphical evidence details found writings muslim authors abbasid inscriptions ancient south arabian calendars reveal number local calendars least south arabian calendars followed lunisolar system albiruni almasudi suggest ancient arabs used month names muslims though also record month names used preislamic arabs4
islamic tradition unanimous stating arabs tihamah hejaz najd distinguished types months permitted ḥalāl forbidden ḥarām months forbidden months four months fighting forbidden listed rajab three months around pilgrimage season alqa‘dah alhijjah muharram information forbidden months also found writings procopius describes armistice eastern arabs lakhmid almundhir happened summer however muslim historians link months particular season quran links four forbidden months nasī’ word literally means postponement4 according muslim tradition decision postponement administered tribe kinanah5 known alqalammas kinanah descendants qalāmisa6
different interpretations concept nasī’ proposed7 scholars muslim89 western45 maintain preislamic calendar used central arabia purely lunar calendar similar modern islamic calendar according view nasī’ related preislamic practices meccan arabs would alter distribution forbidden months within given year without implying calendar manipulation interpretation supported arab historians lexicographers like hisham manzur corpus quranic exegesis10
