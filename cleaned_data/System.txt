etymologyedit
term system comes latin word systēma turn greek σύστημα systēma whole concept made several parts members system literary composition2
historyedit
according marshall mcluhan

system means something look must high visual gradient systematization philosophy prior descartes system plato system aristotle system34

19th century french physicist nicolas léonard sadi carnot studied thermodynamics pioneered development concept system natural sciences 1824 studied system called working substance typically body water vapor steam engines regards systems ability work heat applied working substance could contact either boiler cold reservoir stream cold water piston working body could work pushing 1850 german physicist rudolf clausius generalized picture include concept surroundings began term working body referring system
biologist ludwig bertalanffy 1901–1972 became pioneers general systems theory 1945 introduced models principles laws apply generalized systems subclasses irrespective particular kind nature component elements relation forces them5
norbert wiener 1894–1964 ross ashby 1903–1972 pioneered mathematics study systems carried significant development concept system67
1980s john henry holland 1929– murray gellmann 1929– others coined term complex adaptive system interdisciplinary santa institute
conceptsedit

environment boundaries
systems theory views world complex system interconnected parts scopes system defining boundary means choosing entities inside system outside—part environment make simplified representations models system order understand predict impact future behavior models define structure behavior system


natural humanmade systems
natural humanmade designed systems natural systems apparent objective behavior interpretedby purposeful observer humanmade systems made satisfy identified stated need purposes achieved delivery wanted outputs parts must related must designed work coherent entity—otherwise would distinct systems





open systems input output flows representing exchanges matter energy information surroundings



theoretical framework
systems open systems exchanging matter energy surroundings like coffeemaker computer closed system exchanges energy matter environment like earth project biosphere isolated system exchanges neither matter energy environment theoretical example system universe


process transformation process
open system also viewed bounded transformation process black process collection processes transforms inputs outputscitation needed inputs consumed outputs produced concept input output broad example output passenger ship movement people departure destination


system model
system comprises multiple views manmade systems views concept analysis design implementation deployment structure behavior input data output data views system model required describe represent views


systems architecture
systems architecture using single integrated model description multiple views kind system model

subsystemedit
subsystem elements system component larger system
subsystem description system object contains information defining characteristics operating environment controlled system8
analysisedit
evidently many kinds systems analyzed quantitatively qualitatively example analysis urban systems dynamics steiss9 defined five intersecting systems including physical subsystem behavioral system sociological models influenced systems theory kenneth bailey10 defined systems terms conceptual concrete abstract systems either isolated closed open walter buckley11 defined systems sociology terms mechanical organic process models bela banathy12 cautioned inquiry system understanding kind crucial defined natural designed artificial systems
artificial systems inherently major defect must premised fundamental assumptions upon additional knowledge built fundamental assumptions inherently deleterious must definition assumed true actually false system structurally integral assumed example geometry evident postulation theorems extrapolation proofs
important confuse abstract definitions theorists include natural systems subatomic systems living systems solar system galaxies universe artificial systems include physical structures hybrids natural artificial systems conceptual knowledge human elements organization functions emphasized relevant abstract systems representations cardinal consideration making distinctions among systems determine much freedom system select purpose goals methods tools wide freedom select distributed concentrated
george klir13 maintained classification complete perfect purposes defined systems abstract real conceptual physical systems bounded unbounded systems discrete continuous pulse hybrid systems interactions systems environments categorized relatively closed open systems seems unlikely absolutely closed system exist could known important distinctions also made14 hard systems technical nature amenable methods systems engineering operations research quantitative systems analysis soft systems involve people organisations commonly associated concepts developed peter checkland brian wilson soft systems methodology involving methods action research emphasis participatory designs hard systems might identified scientific distinction often elusive
cultural systemedit
cultural system defined interaction different elements culture cultural system quite different social system sometimes together referred sociocultural system major concern social sciences problem order
economic systemedit
main article economic system
economic system mechanism social institution deals production distribution consumption goods services particular society economic system composed people institutions relationships resources convention property addresses problems economics like allocation scarcity resources
application system conceptedit
systems modeling generally basic principle engineering social sciences system representation entities concern hence inclusion exclusion system context dependent intention modeler
model system include features real system concern model system must include entities belonging real system concern
information computer scienceedit
computer science information science system software system components structure observable interprocess communications behavior example illustrate systems counting roman numerals various systems filing papers catalogues various library systems dewey decimal classification example still fits definition components connected together case facilitate flow information
system also refer framework platform software hardware designed allow software programs
engineering physicsedit
engineering physics physical system portion universe studied thermodynamic system major example engineering also concept system referring parts interactions parts complex project systems engineering branch engineering studies type system planned designed implemented built maintained
social cognitive sciences management researchedit
social cognitive sciences recognize systems human person models human societies include human brain functions mental processes well normative ethics systems socialcultural behavioral patterns
management science operations research organizational development human organizations viewed systems conceptual systems interacting components subsystems system aggregates carriers numerous complex business processes organizational behaviors organizational structures organizational development theorist peter senge developed notion organizations systems book fifth discipline
systems thinking style thinkingreasoning problem solving starts recognition system properties given problem leadership competency people think globally acting locally people consider potential consequences decisions parts larger systems also basis systemic coaching psychology
organizational theorists margaret wheatley also described workings organizational systems metaphoric contexts quantum physics chaos theory selforganization systems
pure logical systemsedit
also thing logical system obvious example calculus developed simultaneously leibniz isaac newton another example george booles boolean operators examples related specifically philosophy biology cognitive science maslows hierarchy needs applies psychology biology using pure logic numerous psychologists including carl jung sigmund freud developed systems logically organize psychological domains personalities motivations intellect desire often domains consist general categories following corollary theorem logic applied categories taxonomy ontology assessment hierarchies
applied strategic thinkingedit
1988 military strategist john warden introduced five ring system model book campaign contending complex system could broken five concentric rings ring—leadership processes infrastructure population action units—could used isolate elements system needed change model used effectively force planners first gulf war151617 late 1990s warden applied model business strategy18
