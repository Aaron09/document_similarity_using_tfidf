historyedit
commercialization telephone began 1876 instruments operated pairs private locations users wanted communicate persons multiple locations many telephones necessary purpose alerting another user desire establish telephone call accomplished whistling loudly transmitter party heard alert bells soon added stations signaling attendant longer needed wait whistle
later telephones took advantage exchange principle already employed telegraph networks telephone wired telephone exchange established town area communications outside exchange area trunks installed exchanges networks designed hierarchical manner spanned cities countries continents oceans
automation introduced pulse dialing telephone exchange subscriber could directly dial another subscriber connected exchange long distance calling across multiple exchanges required manual switching operators later sophisticated address signaling including multifrequency signaling methods enabled directdialed long distance calls subscribers culminating signalling system network controlled calls exchanges 20th century
growth pstn meant teletraffic engineering techniques needed deployed deliver quality service guarantees users work erlang established mathematical foundations methods required determine capacity requirements configuration equipment number personnel required deliver specific level service
1970s telecommunications industry began implementing packetswitched network data services using protocol transported much endtoend equipment already pstn
1980s industry began planning digital services assuming would follow much pattern voice services conceived endtoend circuitswitched services known broadband integrated services digital network bisdn bisdn vision overtaken disruptive technology internet
turn 21st century oldest parts telephone network still analog technology last mile loop user however digital technologies isdn fttx cable modems become common portion network
several large private telephone networks linked pstn usually military purposes also private networks large companies linked pstn limited gateways large private branch exchange
operatorsedit
task building networks selling services customers fell network operators first company incorporated provide pstn services bell telephone company united states
countries however providing telephone networks fell government investment required large provision telephone service increasingly becoming essential public utility example general post office united kingdom brought together number private companies form single nationalized company recent decades however state monopolies broken sold privatizationclarification neededcitation needed
regulationedit
countries central regulator dedicated monitoring provision pstn services country tasks example ensure customers overcharged services monopolies exist also regulate prices charged operators carry others traffic

main article pstn network topology
pstn network architecture evolve years support increasing numbers subscribers calls connections countries direct dialing model developed united states canada adopted nations adaptations local markets
original concept telephone exchanges arranged hierarchies call cannot handled local cluster passed higher onward routing reduced number connecting trunks required operators long distances also kept local traffic separate
however modern networks cost transmission equipment lower although hierarchies still exist much flatter perhaps layers
digital channelsedit
automated telephone exchanges digital switching rather mechanical analog switching trunks connecting exchanges also digital called circuits channels however analog twowire circuits still used connect last mile exchange telephone home also called local loop carry typical phone call calling party called party analog audio signal digitized sample rate 8bit resolution using special type nonlinear pulse code modulation known g711 call transmitted another telephone exchanges call switched using call protocol usually isup telephone exchanges overall routing strategy
call carried pstn using kbits channel originally designed bell labs name given channel digital signal circuit basic granularity circuit switching telephone exchange also known timeslot ds0s aggregated timedivision multiplexing equipment form higher capacity communication links
digital signal circuit carries ds0s north american japanese tcarrier line ds0s calls plus framing signaling ecarrier line used countries modern networks multiplexing function moved close user possible usually cabinets roadside residential areas large business premises
aggregated circuits conveyed initial multiplexer exchange equipment collectively known access network access network interexchange transport synchronous optical transmission example sonet synchronous digital hierarchy technologies although parts still older technology
within access network number reference points defined interest mainly isdn reference point general interest reference point primary multiplexer exchange protocols reference point standardized etsi areas interface
