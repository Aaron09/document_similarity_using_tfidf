microeconomics examines entities forming market structure interact within market create market system entities include private public players various classifications typically operating scarcity tradable units light government regulationclarification needed item traded tangible product apples service repair services legal counsel entertainment
theory free market aggregates quantity demanded buyers quantity supplied sellers reach economic equilibrium time reaction price changes practice various issues prevent equilibrium equilibrium reached necessarily morally equitable example supply healthcare services limited external factors equilibrium price unaffordable many desire cannot
various market structures exist perfectly competitive markets participants large enough market power price homogeneous product words every participant price taker participant influences price product real world markets often experience imperfect competition
forms include monopoly seller good duopoly sellers good oligopoly sellers good monopolistic competition many sellers producing highly differentiated goods monopsony buyer good oligopsony buyers good unlike perfect competition imperfect competition invariably means market power unequally distributed firms imperfect competition potential price makers means holding disproportionately high share market power influence prices products

production cost efficiency
main articles production theory basics opportunity cost economic efficiency production–possibility frontier
microeconomics production conversion inputs outputs economic process uses inputs create commodity service exchange direct production flow thus rate output period time distinctions include production alternatives consumption food haircuts investment goods tractors buildings roads public goods national defence smallpox vaccinations private goods computers bananas guns butter
opportunity cost refers economic cost production value next best opportunity foregone choices must made desirable mutually exclusive actions described expressing basic relationship scarcity choice31 example baker uses sack flour make pretzels morning baker cannot either flour morning make bagels instead part cost making pretzels neither flour morning available longer opportunity cost activity element ensuring scarce resources used efficiently cost weighed value activity deciding less opportunity costs restricted monetary financial costs could measured real cost output forgone leisure anything else provides alternative benefit utility32
inputs used production process include primary factors production labour services capital durable produced goods used production existing factory land including natural resources inputs include intermediate goods used production final goods steel
economic efficiency describes well system generates desired output given inputs available technology efficiency improved output generated without changing inputs words amount waste reduced widely accepted general standard pareto efficiency reached change make someone better without making someone else worse




example production–possibility frontier illustrative points marked


production–possibility frontier expository figure representing scarcity cost efficiency simplest case economy produce goods guns butter table graph right showing different quantity combinations goods producible given technology total factor inputs limit feasible total output point curve shows potential total output economy maximum feasible output good given feasible output quantity good
scarcity represented figure people willing unable aggregate consume beyond negative slope curve33 production good increases along curve production good decreases inverse relationship increasing output good requires transferring inputs production good decreasing latter
slope curve point gives tradeoff goods measures additional unit good costs units forgone good example real opportunity cost thus costs units butter opportunity cost butter along scarcity implies choosing good aggregate entails less good still market economy movement along curve indicate choice increased output anticipated worth cost agents
construction point curve shows productive efficiency maximizing output given total inputs point inside curve feasible represents production inefficiency wasteful inputs output goods could increase moving northeast direction point curve examples cited inefficiency include high unemployment businesscycle recession economic organization country discourages full resources curve might still fully satisfy allocative efficiency also called pareto efficiency produce goods consumers prefer points

specialization
main articles division labour comparative advantage gains trade




showing main trade routes goods within late medieval europe


specialization considered economic efficiency based theoretical empirical considerations different individuals nations different real opportunity costs production differences stocks human capital worker capitallabour ratios according theory give comparative advantage production goods make intensive relatively abundant thus relatively cheaper input
even region absolute advantage ratio outputs inputs every type output still specialize output comparative advantage thereby gain trading region lacks absolute advantage comparative advantage producing something else
observed high volume trade occurs among regions even access similar technology factor inputs including highincome countries investigation economies scale agglomeration explain specialization similar differentiated product lines overall benefit respective trading parties regions35
general theory specialization applies trade among individuals farms manufacturers service providers economies among production systems corresponding division labour different work groups specializing correspondingly different types capital equipment differentiated land uses36
example combines features country specializes production hightech knowledge products developed countries trades developing nations goods produced factories labour relatively cheap plentiful resulting different opportunity costs production total output utility thereby results specializing production trading country produced hightech lowtech products
theory observation conditions market prices outputs productive inputs select allocation factor inputs comparative advantage relatively lowcost inputs producing lowcost outputs process aggregate output increase byproduct design37 specialization production creates opportunities gains trade whereby resource owners benefit trade sale type output highly valued goods measure gains trade increased income levels trade facilitate38

economics depression spur creation macroeconomics separate discipline field study great depression 1930s john maynard keynes authored book entitled general theory employment interest money outlining theories keynesian economics keynes contended aggregate demand goods might insufficient economic downturns leading unnecessarily high unemployment losses potential output
therefore advocated active policy responses public sector including monetary policy actions central bank fiscal policy actions government stabilize output business cycle68 thus central conclusion keynesian economics situations strong automatic mechanism moves output employment towards full employment levels john hicks islm model influential interpretation general theory
