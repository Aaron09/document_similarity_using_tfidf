historyedit
beginnings netscapeedit
1993 national center supercomputing applications ncsa unit university illinois urbanachampaign released ncsa mosaic first popular graphical browser played important part expanding growth nascent world wide 1994 company called mosaic communications founded mountain view california employed many original ncsa mosaic authors create mosaic netscape however intentionally shared code ncsa mosaic internal codename companys browser mozilla stood mosaic killer companys goal displace ncsa mosaic worlds number browser first version browser mosaic netscape released late 1994 within four months already taken threequarters browser market became main browser internet 1990s avoid trademark ownership problems ncsa browser subsequently renamed netscape navigator year company took name netscape communications netscape communications realized needed become dynamic marc andreessen founder company believed html needed glue language easy designers parttime programmers assemble components images plugins code could written directly page markup
1995 netscape communications recruited brendan eich goal embedding scheme programming language netscape navigator8 could started netscape communications collaborated microsystems include netscape navigator suns static programming language java order compete microsoft user adoption technologies platforms9 netscape communications decided scripting language wanted create would complement java similar syntax excluded adopting languages perl python scheme defend idea javascript competing proposals company needed prototype eich wrote days 1995
although developed name mocha language officially called livescript first shipped beta releases netscape navigator september 1995 renamed javascript2 deployed netscape navigator beta december10 final choice name caused confusion giving impression language spinoff java programming language choice characterizedby marketing ploy netscape give javascript cachet programming language
common misconception javascript influenced earlier page scripting language developed nombas named confused later created 19971112 brendan eich however never heard created livescript13 nombas pitch embedded page scripting netscape though page scripting concept shown violawww browser14 nombas later switched offering javascript instead scriptease product part tc39 group standardized ecmascript15
serverside javascriptedit
december 1995 soon releasing javascript browsers netscape introduced implementation language serverside scripting netscape enterprise server16
since mid2000s additional serverside javascript implementations introduced nodejs 200917
adoption microsoftedit
microsoft script technologies including vbscript jscript released 1996 jscript reverseengineered implementation netscapes javascript part internet explorer jscript also available serverside scripting internet information server internet explorer also included microsofts first support various extensions html case implementation noticeably different found netscape navigator time1819 differences made difficult designers programmers make single website work well browsers leading best viewed netscape best viewed internet explorer logos characterized early years browser wars20 javascript began acquire reputation roadblocks crossplatform standardsdriven developers took difficult task trying make sites work major browsers many could afford time18 release internet explorer microsoft introduced concept dynamic html differences language implementations different proprietary document object models remained obstacles widespread takeup javascript web18
standardizationedit
november 1996 netscape submitted javascript ecma international carve standard specification browser vendors could implement based work done netscape official release language specification ecmascript published first edition ecma262 standard june 1997 javascript well known implementations actionscript jscript wellknown implementations ecmascript
standards process continued cycles release ecmascript june 1998 brings modifications conform isoiec 16262 international standard release ecmascript followed december 1999 baseline modern javascript original ecmascript work waldemar horwat netscape google started 2000 first microsoft seemed participate even implemented proposals jscript language
time clear though microsoft intention cooperating implementing proper javascript internet explorer even though competing proposal partial diverged point implementation server side 2003 original ecmascript work mothballed
next major event 2005 major happenings javascripts history first brendan eich mozilla rejoined ecma international notforprofit member work started ecmascript ecma357 standard came exmicrosoft employees systems originally acquired crossgain working jointly macromedia later acquired adobe systems implementing actionscript actionscript fork original ecmascript
along macromedia work restarted ecmascript goal standardizing actionscript adobe systems released actionscript virtual machine code named tamarin open source project tamarin actionscript different javascript converge realized parties 2007 2008
alas still turmoil various players douglas crockford—then yahoo—joined forces microsoft 2007 oppose ecmascript ecmascript effort development ecmascript never completed work influenced subsequent versions21
happening open source developer communities work revolutionize could done javascript community effort sparked 2005 jesse james garrett released white paper coined term ajax described technologies javascript backbone used create applications data loaded background avoiding need full page reloads leading dynamic applications resulted renaissance period javascript usage spearheaded open source libraries communities formed around libraries prototype jquery dojo toolkit mootools others released
july 2008 disparate parties either side came together oslo eventual agreement early 2009 rename ecmascript ecmascript drive language forward using agenda known harmony ecmascript finally released december 2009
june 2011 ecmascript released fully align third edition isoiec 16262 international standard ecmascript 2015 released june 2015 ecmascript 2016 released june 2016 current version ecmascript 2017 released june 201722
later developmentsedit
javascript become popular programming languages initially however many professional programmers denigrated language among reasons target audience consisted authors amateurs23 advent ajax returned javascript spotlight brought professional programming attention result proliferation comprehensive frameworks libraries improved javascript programming practices increased usage javascript outside browsers seen proliferation serverside javascript platforms
january 2009 commonjs project founded goal specifying common standard library mainly javascript development outside browser24
rise singlepage applications javascriptheavy sites increasingly used compile target sourcetosource compilers dynamic languages static languages
trademarkedit
javascript trademark oracle corporation united states25 used license technology invented implemented netscape communications current entities mozilla foundation26
vanilla javascriptedit
terms vanilla javascript vanilla refer javascript extended frameworks additional libraries scripts written vanilla plain javascript code2728
featuresedit
following features common conforming ecmascript implementations unless explicitly specified otherwise
universal supportedit
modern browsers support javascript builtin interpreters
imperative structurededit
javascript supports much structured programming syntax statements loops switch statements loops partial exception scoping javascript originally function scoping ecmascript 2015 added keywords const block scoping meaning javascript function block scoping like javascript makes distinction expressions statements syntactic difference automatic semicolon insertion allows semicolons would normally terminate statements omitted29
dynamicedit

typing
scripting languages javascript dynamically typed type associated value rather expression example variable time bound number later rebound string30 javascript supports various ways test type object including duck typing31
runtime evaluation
javascript includes eval function execute statements provided strings runtime

prototypebased objectorientededit
javascript almost entirely objectbased javascript object associative array augmented prototype string provides name object property syntactical ways specify name notation objx bracket notation objx property added rebound deleted runtime properties object property belongs objects prototype inheritance chain enumerated using forin loop
javascript small number builtin objects including function date

prototypes
javascript uses prototypes many objectoriented languages classes inheritance32 possible simulate many classbased features prototypes javascript33
functions object constructors
functions double object constructors along typical role prefixing function call create instance prototype inheriting properties methods constructor including properties object prototype34 ecmascript offers objectcreate method allowing explicit creation instance without automatically inheriting object prototype older environments assign prototype null35 constructors prototype property determines object used objects internal prototype methods added modifying prototype function used constructor javascripts builtin constructors array object also prototypes modified possible modify object prototype generally considered practice objects javascript inherit methods properties object prototype expect prototype modified36
functions methods
unlike many objectoriented languages distinction function definition method definition rather distinction occurs function calling function called method object functions local keyword bound object invocation

functionaledit
function firstclass function considered object function properties methods call bind37 nested function function defined within another function created time outer function invoked addition nested function forms lexical closure lexical scope outer function including constant local variable argument value becomes part internal state inner function object even execution outer function concludes38 javascript also supports anonymous functions
delegativeedit
javascript supports implicit explicit delegation

functions roles traits mixins
javascript natively supports various functionbased implementations role39 patterns like traits4041 mixins42 function defines additional behavior least method bound keyword within function body role delegated explicitly call apply objects need feature additional behavior shared prototype chain
object composition inheritance
whereas explicit functionbased delegation cover composition javascript implicit delegation already happens every time prototype chain walked order find method might related directly owned object method found gets called within objects context thus inheritance javascript covered delegation automatism bound prototype property constructor functions

miscellaneousedit

runtime environment
javascript typically relies runtime environment browser provide objects methods scripts interact environment webpage also relies runtime environment provide ability includeimport scripts html script elements language feature common javascript implementations


javascript processes messages queue time upon loading message javascript calls function associated message creates call stack frame functions arguments local variables call stack shrinks grows based functions needs upon function completion stack empty javascript proceeds next message queue called event loop described completion message fully processed next message considered however languages concurrency model describes event loop nonblocking program inputoutput performed using events callback functions means instance javascript process mouse click waiting database query return information43


variadic functions
indefinite number parameters passed function function access formal parameters also local arguments object variadic functions also created using bind method


array object literals
like many scripting languages arrays objects associative arrays languages created succinct shortcut syntax fact literals form basis json data format


regular expressions
javascript also supports regular expressions manner similar perl provide concise powerful syntax text manipulation sophisticated builtin string functions44

vendorspecific extensionsedit
javascript officially managed mozilla foundation language features added periodically however javascript engines support features

property getter setter functions supported webkit gecko opera45 actionscript rhino46
conditional catch clauses
iterator protocol adopted python
shallow generatorscoroutines adopted python
array comprehensions generator expressions adopted python
proper block scope keyword
array object destructuring limited form pattern matching
concise function expressions functionargs expr
ecmascript extension adds native support ecmascript unsupported firefox since version 2147

pagesedit
also dynamic html ajax programming
2017 million popular pages used javascript52 common javascript clientside behavior html pages also known dynamic html dhtml scripts embedded included html pages interact document object model page simple examples usage

loading page content submitting data server ajax without reloading page example social network might allow user post status updates without leaving page
animation page elements fading resizing moving
interactive content example games playing audio video
validating input values form make sure acceptable submitted server
transmitting information users reading habits browsing activities various websites pages frequently analytics tracking personalization purposes53

javascript code locally users browser rather remote server browser respond user actions quickly making application responsive furthermore javascript code detect user actions html alone cannot individual keystrokes applications gmail take advantage much userinterface logic written javascript javascript dispatches requests information content email message server wider trend ajax programming similarly exploits strength
javascript engine also known javascript interpreter javascript implementation interpreter interprets javascript source code executes script accordingly first javascript engine created brendan eich netscape netscape navigator browser engine codenamed spidermonkey implemented since updated javascript conform ecmascript rhino engine created primarily norris boyd formerly netscape google javascript implementation java rhino like spidermonkey ecmascript compliant
browser common host environment javascript browsers typically create host objects represent javascript server another common host environment javascript server would typically expose host objects representing http request response objects javascript program could interrogate manipulate dynamically generate pages
javascript language popular browsers share support become target language many frameworks languages even though javascript never intended language54 despite performance limitations inherent dynamic nature increasing speed javascript engines made language surprisingly feasible compilation target

compatibility considerationsedit
main article interoperability
javascript runs widely varying environments important part testing debugging test verify javascript works across multiple browsers
interfaces manipulating pages part ecmascript standard javascript officially interfaces defined separate standardization effort practice browser implementations differ standards browsers execute javascript
deal differences javascript authors attempt write standardscompliant code also executed correctly browsers failing write code checks presence certain browser features behaves differently available55 cases browsers implement feature different behavior authors find practical detect browser running change scripts behavior match5657 programmers also libraries toolkits take browser differences account
furthermore scripts work users example user

rare browser incomplete unusual support
mobile phone browser cannot execute javascript
javascript execution disabled security precaution
speech browser example visual disability

support users authors create pages degrade gracefully user agents browsers support pages javascript particular page remain usable albeit without extra features javascript would added sites html noscript contains content disabled alternative approach many find preferable first author content using basic technologies work browsers enhance content users javascript enabled known progressive enhancement
securityedit
also browser security
javascript provide potential malicious authors deliver scripts client computer browser authors contain risk using restrictions first scripts sandbox perform webrelated actions generalpurpose programming tasks like creating files second scripts constrained sameorigin policy scripts site access information usernames passwords cookies sent another site javascriptrelated security bugs breaches either origin policy sandbox
subsets general javascript—adsafe secure ecmascript ses—that provide greater levels security especially code created third parties advertisements5859 caja another project safe embedding isolation thirdparty javascript html

crosssite vulnerabilitiesedit
main articles crosssite scripting crosssite request forgery
common javascriptrelated security problem crosssite scripting violation sameorigin policy vulnerabilities occur attacker able cause target site online banking website include malicious script webpage presented victim script example access banking application privileges victim potentially disclosing secret information transferring money without victims authorization solution vulnerabilities html escaping whenever displaying untrusted data
browsers include partial protection reflected attacks attacker provides including malicious script however even users browsers vulnerable attacks malicious code stored database correct design applications server side fully prevent
vulnerabilities also occur implementation mistakes browser authors60
another crosssite vulnerability crosssite request forgery csrf csrf code attackers site tricks victims browser taking actions user didnt intend target site like transferring money bank works target site relies cookies authenticate requests requests initiated code attackers site carry legitimate login credentials requests initiated user general solution csrf require authentication value hidden form field cookies authenticate request might lasting effects checking http referrer header also help
javascript hijacking type csrf attack script attackers site exploits page victims site returns private information json javascript possible solutions include

requiring authentication token post parameters response returns private information

misplaced trust clientedit
developers clientserver applications must recognize untrusted clients control attackers application author cannot assume javascript code intended secret embedded code could extracted determined adversary implications

site authors cannot perfectly conceal javascript operates source code must sent client code obfuscated obfuscation reverseengineered
javascript form validation provides convenience users security site verifies user agreed terms service filters invalid characters fields contain numbers must server client
scripts selectively disabled javascript cant relied prevent operations rightclicking image save it61
extremely practice embed sensitive information passwords javascript extracted attacker

misplaced trust developersedit
package management systems bower popular javascript developers systems allow developer easily manage programs dependencies upon developers program libraries developers trust maintainers libraries keep secure date always case vulnerability emerged blind trust relied upon libraries release update causes bugs vulnerabilities appear programs rely upon library inversely library unpatched known vulnerabilities wild study done looking sample 133k websites researchers found websites included library atleast known vulnerability62 median oldest library version used website newest available version library 1177 days alexa development libraries still active ceased years ago62 another possibility maintainer library remove library entirely occurred march 2016 azer koçulu removed repository caused tens thousands programs websites depending upon libraries break6364
browser plugin coding errorsedit
javascript provides interface wide range browser capabilities flaws buffer overflows flaws allow attackers write scripts would code wish users system code means limited another javascript application example buffer overrun exploit allow attacker gain access operating systems superuser privileges
flaws affected major browsers including firefox65 internet explorer66 safari67
