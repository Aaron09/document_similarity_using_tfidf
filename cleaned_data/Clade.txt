clade ancient greek κλάδος klados branch group organisms consists common ancestor lineal descendants represents single branch tree life1
common ancestor individual population species extinct extant right kingdom clades nested another branch turn splits smaller branches splits reflect evolutionary history populations diverged evolved independently clades termed monophyletic greek clan groups
last decades cladistic approach revolutionized biological classification revealed surprising evolutionary relationships among organisms2 increasingly taxonomists avoid naming taxa clades taxa monophyletic interesting revelations relationships organisms molecular biology cladistics revealed fungi closer relatives animals plants archaea considered different bacteria multicellular organisms evolved archaea3

etymologyedit
term clade coined 1957 biologist julian huxley refer result cladogenesis concept huxley borrowed bernhard rensch14
many commonly named groups clades example rodents insects case name refers common ancestor descendant branches rodents example branch mammals split period clade dinosauria stopped dominant terrestrial vertebrates million years original population descendants clade rodent clade corresponds order rodentia insects class insecta clades include smaller clades chipmunk consists even smaller clades clade rodent turn included mammal vertebrate animal clades
history nomenclature taxonomyedit




early phylogenetic tree haeckel 1866 groups thought advanced birds aves placed


idea clade exist predarwinian linnaean taxonomy based necessity internal external morphological similarities organisms although happens many better known animal groups linnaeus original systema naturae notably among vertebrate groups represent clades phenomenon convergent evolution however responsible many cases misleading similarities morphology groups evolved different lineages
increasing realization first half 19th century species changed split ages classification increasingly came seen branches evolutionary tree life publication darwins theory evolution 1859 gave view increasing weight thomas henry huxley early advocate evolutionary theory proposed revised taxonomy based clades5 example grouped birds reptiles based fossil evidence5
german biologist emil hans willi hennig 1913 1976 considered founder cladistics6 proposed classification system represented repeated branchings family tree opposed previous systems organisms ladder supposedly advanced organisms top27
taxonomists increasingly worked make taxonomic system reflect evolution7 comes naming however principle always compatible traditional rankbased nomenclature latter taxa associated rank named enough ranks name long series nested clades also taxon names cannot defined guarantees refer clades reasons phylogenetic nomenclature developed still controversial
