definitionedit
multiple definitions alpine climate
simple definition climate causes trees fail grow cold according holdridge life zone system alpine climate occurs mean biotemperature location prevents tree growth biotemperature defined temperature except temperatures treated plants dormant freezing1
köppen climate classification alpine climate part group along polar climate month mean temperature higher
causeedit
temperature profile atmosphere result interaction radiation convection sunlight visible spectrum hits ground heats ground heats surface radiation transfer heat ground space greenhouse effect gases atmosphere would keep ground roughly temperature would decay exponentially height3
however tends expand lowers density thus tends rise transfer heat upward process convection convection comes equilibrium parcel given altitude density surroundings poor conductor heat parcel rise fall without exchanging heat known adiabatic process characteristic pressuretemperature curve pressure gets lower temperature decreases rate decrease temperature elevation known adiabatic lapse rate approximately kilometer 1000 feet altitude3
note presence water atmosphere complicates process convection water vapor contains latent heat vaporization rises cools eventually becomes saturated cannot hold quantity water vapor water vapor condenses forming clouds releases heat changes lapse rate adiabatic lapse rate moist adiabatic lapse rate kilometre 1000 feet4 actual lapse rate called environmental lapse rate constant fluctuate throughout seasonally also regionally normal lapse rate 1000 1000 ft56 therefore moving metres mountain roughly equivalent moving kilometres miles 075° latitude towards pole7 relationship approximate however since local factors proximity oceans drastically modify climate8 altitude increases main form precipitation becomes snow winds increase temperature continues drop tropopause 11000 metres 36000 decrease however higher highest summit
