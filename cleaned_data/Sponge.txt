sponges work rather like chimneys take water bottom eject osculum little mouth since ambient currents faster suction effect produce bernoullis principle work free sponges control water flow various combinations wholly partially closing osculum ostia intake pores varying beat flagella shut sand silt water21
although layers pinacocytes choanocytes resemble epithelia complex animals bound tightly celltocell connections basal lamina thin fibrous sheet underneath flexibility layers remodeling mesohyl lophocytes allow animals adjust shapes throughout lives take maximum advantage local water currents29
simplest body structure sponges tube vase shape known asconoid severely limits size animal body structure characterized stalklike spongocoel surrounded single layer choanocytes simply scaled ratio volume surface area increases surface increases square length width volume increases proportionally cube amount tissue needs food oxygen determined volume pumping capacity supplies food oxygen depends area covered choanocytes asconoid sponges seldom exceed 0039 diameter21

sponges overcome limitation adopting syconoid structure body wall pleated inner pockets pleats lined choanocytes connect outer pockets pleats ostia increase number choanocytes hence pumping capacity enables syconoid sponges grow centimeters diameter
leuconoid pattern boosts pumping capacity filling interior almost completely mesohyl contains network chambers lined choanocytes connected water intakes outlet tubes leuconid sponges grow diameter fact growth direction increases number choanocyte chambers enables take wider range forms example encrusting sponges whose shapes follow surfaces attach freshwater shallowwater marine sponges leuconid bodies networks water passages glass sponges similar leuconid structure21 three types structure crosssection area choanocytelined regions much greater intake outlet channels makes flow slower near choanocytes thus makes easier trap food particles21 example leuconia small leuconoid sponge centimetres tall centimetre diameter water enters 80000 intake canals minute however leuconia million flagellated chambers whose combined diameter much greater canals water flow chambers slows hour making easy choanocytes capture food water expelled single osculum second fast enough carry waste products distance away30

vital functions




spongia officinalis kitchen sponge dark grey alive


movement
although adult sponges fundamentally sessile animals marine freshwater species move across speeds 0039–0157 result amoebalike movements pinacocytes cells species contract whole bodies many close oscula ostia juveniles drift swim freely adults stationary21
respiration feeding excretion
sponges distinct circulatory respiratory digestive excretory systems instead water flow system supports functions filter food particles water flowing particles larger micrometers cannot enter ostia pinacocytes consume phagocytosis engulfing internal digestion particles trapped ostia taper outer inner ends particles consumed pinacocytes archaeocytes partially extrude walls ostia bacteriasized particles micrometers pass ostia caught consumed choanocytes21 since smallest particles common choanocytes typically capture sponges food supply31 archaeocytes transport food packaged vesicles cells directly digest food least species sponge internal fibers function tracks nutrientcarrying archaeocytes21 tracks also move inert objects22

used claimed glass sponges could live nutrients dissolved water averse silt32 however study 2007 found evidence concluded extract bacteria microorganisms water efficiently process suspended sediment grains extract prey33 collar bodies digest food distribute wrapped vesicles transported dynein motor molecules along bundles microtubules throughout syncytium21
sponges cells absorb oxygen diffusion water cells water flows body carbon dioxide soluble waste products ammonia also diffuse archeocytes remove mineral particles threaten block ostia transport mesohyl generally dump outgoing water current although species incorporate skeletons21
carnivorous sponges
species live waters supply food particles poor prey crustaceans small animals species discovered34 belong family cladorhizidae members guitarridae esperiopsidae also carnivores35 cases little known actually capture prey although species thought either sticky threads hooked spicules3536 carnivorous sponges live deep waters 8840 mi37 development deepocean exploration techniques expected lead discovery several more2135 however species found mediterranean caves depths 17–23 56–75 alongside usual filter feeding sponges cavedwelling predators capture crustaceans 0039 long entangling fine threads digest enveloping threads course days return normal shape evidence venom37
known carnivorous sponges completely lost water flow system choanocytes however genus chondrocladia uses highly modified water flow system inflate balloonlike structures used capturing prey3538
endosymbionts
freshwater sponges often host green algae endosymbionts within archaeocytes cells benefit nutrients produced algae many marine species host photosynthesizing organisms commonly cyanobacteria cases dinoflagellates symbiotic cyanobacteria form third total mass living tissue sponges sponges gain energy supply microorganisms21 2008 university stuttgart team reported spicules made silica conduct light mesohyl photosynthesizing endosymbionts live39 sponges host photosynthesizing organisms common waters relatively poor supplies food particles often leafy shapes maximize amount sunlight collect22
recently discovered carnivorous sponge lives near hydrothermal vents hosts methaneeating bacteria digests them22
immune system
sponges complex immune systems animals however reject grafts species accept members species marine species gray cells play leading role rejection foreign material invaded produce chemical stops movement cells affected area thus preventing intruder using sponges internal transport systems intrusion persists grey cells concentrate area release toxins kill cells area immune system stay activated state three weeks22
reproduction
asexual




freshwater sponge spongilla lacustris


sponges three asexual methods reproduction fragmentation budding producing gemmules fragments sponges detached currents waves mobility pinacocytes choanocytes reshaping mesohyl reattach suitable surface rebuild small functional sponges course several days capabilities enable sponges squeezed fine cloth regenerate40 sponge fragment regenerate contains collencytes produce mesohyl archeocytes produce cell types31 species reproduce budding41
gemmules survival pods marine sponges many freshwater species produce thousands dying mainly freshwater species regularly produce autumn spongocytes make gemmules wrapping shells spongin often reinforced spicules round clusters archeocytes full nutrients42 freshwater gemmules also include phytosynthesizing symbionts43 gemmules become dormant state survive cold drying lack oxygen extreme variations salinity21 freshwater gemmules often revive temperature drops stays cold months reaches nearnormal level43 gemmule germinates archeocytes round outside cluster transform pinacocytes membrane pore shell bursts cluster cells slowly emerges remaining archeocytes transform cell types needed make functioning sponge gemmules species different individuals join forces form sponge44 gemmules retained within parent sponge spring difficult tell whether sponge revived recolonized gemmules43
sexual
sponges hermaphrodites function sexes simultaneously although sponges gonads reproductive organs sperm produced choanocytes entire choanocyte chambers sink mesohyl form spermatic cysts eggs formed transformation archeocytes choanocytes species generally acquires yolk consuming nurse cells spawning sperm burst cysts expelled osculum contact another sponge species water flow carries choanocytes engulf instead digesting metamorphose ameboid form carry sperm mesohyl eggs cases engulf carrier cargo45
species release fertilized eggs water retain eggs hatch four types larvae balls cells outer layer cells whose flagellae cilia enable larvae move swimming days larvae sink crawl find place settle cells transform archeocytes types appropriate locations miniature adult sponge45
glass sponge embryos start dividing separate cells cells formed rapidly transform larvae externally ovoid band cilia round middle movement internally typical glass sponge structure spicules cobweblike main syncitium draped around choanosyncytia multiple collar bodies center larvae leave parents bodies46
life cycle
sponges temperate regions live years tropical species perhaps deepocean ones live years calcified demosponges grow 00079 year rate constant specimens wide must 5000 years sponges start sexual reproduction weeks others wait several years old21
coordination activities
adult sponges lack neurons kind nervous tissue however species ability perform movements coordinated bodies mainly contractions pinacocytes squeezing water channels thus expelling excess sediment substances cause blockages species contract osculum independently rest body sponges also contract order reduce area vulnerable attack predators cases sponges fused example large still unseparated contraction waves slowly become coordinated siamese twins coordinating mechanism unknown involve chemicals similar neurotransmitters47 however glass sponges rapidly transmit electrical impulses parts syncytium halt motion flagella incoming water contains toxins excessive sediment21 myocytes thought responsible closing osculum transmitting signals different parts body22
