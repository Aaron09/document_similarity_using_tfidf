simplest form quality control sketch desired item sketch match item rejected simple gono procedure however manufacturers soon found difficult costly make parts exactly like depiction hence around 1840 tolerance limits introduced wherein design would function parts measured within limits quality thus precisely defined using devices plug gauges ring gauges however address problem defective items recycling disposing waste adds cost production trying reduce defect rate various methods proposed prioritize quality control issues determine whether leave unaddressed quality assurance techniques improve stabilize production6
