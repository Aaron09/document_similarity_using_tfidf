ranking

qualify stream body water must either recurring perennial recurring intermittent streams water channel least part year stream first order stream recurring perennial stream feeding firstorder streams come together form secondorder stream secondorder streams come together form thirdorder stream streams lower order joining higher order stream change order higher stream thus firstorder stream joins secondorder stream remains secondorder stream secondorder stream combines another secondorder stream becomes thirdorder stream

gradient

gradient stream critical factor determining character entirely determined base level erosion base level erosion point stream either enters ocean lake pond enters stretch much lower gradient specifically applied particular stretch stream
geological terms stream erode achieve base level erosion throughout course base level stream rapidly underlying strata steep gradient base level relatively high stream form flood plain meander

meander

meanders looping changes direction stream caused erosion deposition bank materials typically serpentine form typically time meanders gradually migrate downstream
resistant material slows stops downstream movement meander stream erode neck legs meander become temporarily straighter leaving behind arcshaped body water termed oxbow lake bayou flood also cause meander

profile

typically streams said particular profile beginning steep gradients flood plain little shifting channels eventually evolving streams gradients wide flood plains extensive meanders initial stage sometimes termed young immature stream later state mature stream however stream meander distance falling young stream condition

stream load

streams carry sediment alluvium amount load carry capacity well largest object carry competence dependent velocity stream

ephemeral streamedit
generally streams flow immediately precipitation termed ephemeral clear demarcation surface runoff ephemeral stream1458 ephemeral streams classed intermittent—flow disappearing normal course seasons ample flow backups restoring stream presence—such circumstances documented stream beds opened path mines underground chambers17
