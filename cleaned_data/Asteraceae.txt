characteristicsedit

roots stemsedit
members asteraceae generally produce taproots sometimes possess fibrous root systems stems herbaceous aerial branched cylindrical glandular hairs generally erect prostrate ascending species underground stems form caudices rhizomes fleshy woody depending species10
leavesedit
leaves stems often contain secretory canals resin latex particularly common among cichorioideae leaves alternate opposite whorled simple often deeply lobed otherwise incised often conduplicate revolute margins entire lobed toothed
