signs symptoms




main symptoms variants stages tuberculosis given14 many symptoms overlapping variants others entirely specific certain variants multiple variants present simultaneously


tuberculosis infect part body commonly occurs lungs known pulmonary tuberculosis5 extrapulmonary occurs tuberculosis develops outside lungs although extrapulmonary coexist pulmonary
general signs symptoms include fever chills night sweats loss appetite weight loss fatigue5 significant nail clubbing also occur15
pulmonary
tuberculosis infection become active commonly involves lungs cases1316 symptoms include chest pain prolonged cough producing sputum people symptoms remain asymptomatic13 occasionally people cough blood small amounts rare cases infection erode pulmonary artery rasmussens aneurysm resulting massive bleeding517 tuberculosis become chronic illness cause extensive scarring upper lobes lungs upper lung lobes frequently affected tuberculosis lower ones5 reason difference clear12 either better flow12 poor lymph drainage within upper lungs5
extrapulmonary
15–20 active cases infection spreads outside lungs causing kinds tb18 collectively denoted extrapulmonary tuberculosis19 extrapulmonary occurs commonly immunosuppressed persons young children occurs cases19 notable extrapulmonary infection sites include pleura tuberculous pleurisy central nervous system tuberculous meningitis lymphatic system scrofula neck genitourinary system urogenital tuberculosis bones joints pott disease spine among others
spread lymph nodes common20 ulcer originating nearby infected lymph nodes occur painless slowly enlarging appearance wash leather21
spreads bones known osseous tuberculosis22 form osteomyelitis12 potentially serious widespread form called disseminated tuberculosis also known miliary tuberculosis5 miliary currently makes extrapulmonary cases23

risk factors
main article risk factors tuberculosis
number factors make people susceptible infections important risk factor globally people infected virus41 particular problem subsaharan africa rates high4243 people without infected tuberculosis 5–10 develop active disease lifetimes15 contrast coinfected develop active disease15
tuberculosis closely linked overcrowding malnutrition making principal diseases poverty13 high risk thus include people inject illicit drugs inhabitants employees locales vulnerable people gather prisons homeless shelters medically underprivileged resourcepoor communities highrisk ethnic minorities children close contact highrisk category patients healthcare providers serving patients44
chronic lung disease another significant risk factor silicosis increases risk 30fold45 smoke cigarettes nearly twice risk compared nonsmokers46
disease states also increase risk developing tuberculosis include alcoholism13 diabetes mellitus threefold increase47
certain medications corticosteroids infliximab antiαtnf monoclonal antibody becoming increasingly important risk factors especially developed world13
genetic susceptibility also exists48 overall importance remains undefined13
mechanism




public health campaigns 1920s tried halt spread


transmission
people active pulmonary cough sneeze speak sing spit expel infectious aerosol droplets diameter single sneeze release 40000 droplets49 droplets transmit disease since infectious dose tuberculosis small inhalation fewer bacteria cause infection50
people prolonged frequent close contact people particularly high risk becoming infected estimated infection rate51 person active untreated tuberculosis infect 10–15 people year52 transmission occur people active latent infection thought contagious12 probability transmission person another depends upon several factors including number infectious droplets expelled carrier effectiveness ventilation duration exposure virulence tuberculosis strain level immunity uninfected person others53 cascade persontoperson spread circumvented segregating active overt putting antitb drug regimens weeks effective treatment subjects nonresistant active infections generally remain contagious others51 someone become infected typically takes three four weeks newly infected person becomes infectious enough transmit disease others54

management
main article tuberculosis management
treatment uses antibiotics kill bacteria effective treatment difficult unusual structure chemical composition mycobacterial cell wall hinders entry drugs makes many antibiotics ineffective88 antibiotics commonly used isoniazid rifampicin treatments prolonged taking several months53 latent treatment usually employs single antibiotic89 active disease best treated combinations several antibiotics reduce risk bacteria developing antibiotic resistance13 people latent infections also treated prevent progressing active disease later life89 directly observed therapy health care provider watch person take medications recommended effort reduce number people appropriately taking antibiotics90 evidence support practice people simply taking medications independently poor quality91 strong evidence indicating directly observed therapy improves number people cured number people complete medicine91 moderate quality evidence suggests also difference people observed home versus clinic family member versus health care worker91 methods remind people importance treatment appointments result small important improvement92
onset
recommended treatment newonset pulmonary tuberculosis 2010 months combination antibiotics containing rifampicin isoniazid pyrazinamide ethambutol first months rifampicin isoniazid last four months13 resistance isoniazid high ethambutol added last four months alternative13
recurrent disease
tuberculosis recurs testing determine antibiotics sensitive important determining treatment13 multiple drugresistant mdrtb detected treatment least four effective antibiotics months recommended13
medication resistance
primary resistance occurs person becomes infected resistant strain person fully susceptible develop secondary acquired resistance therapy inadequate treatment taking prescribed regimen appropriately lack compliance using lowquality medication93 drugresistant serious public health issue many developing countries treatment longer requires expensive drugs mdrtb defined resistance effective firstline drugs rifampicin isoniazid extensively drugresistant also resistant three classes secondline drugs94 totally drugresistant resistant currently used drugs95 first observed 2003 italy96 widely reported 20129597 also found iran india9899 bedaquiline tentatively supported multiple drugresistant tb100
