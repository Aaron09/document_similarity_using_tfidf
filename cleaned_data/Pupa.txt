position life cycleedit
pupal stage follows larval stage precedes adulthood imago insects complete metamorphosis pupa nonfeeding usually sessile stage pupation adult structures insect formed larval structures broken adult structures grow imaginal discs
durationedit
pupation last weeks months even years depends temperature species insect23 example pupation lasts eight fifteen days monarch butterflies4 pupa enter dormancy diapause appropriate season emerge adult insect temperate climates pupae usually stay dormant winter tropics pupae usually season
emergenceedit

eclosion papilio dardanus


insects emerge eclose pupae splitting pupal case butterflies emerge morning mosquitoes emergence evening night fleas process triggered vibrations indicate possible presence suitable host prior emergence adult inside pupal exoskeleton termed pharate pharate adult eclosed pupa empty pupal exoskeleton called exuvia hymenopterans ants bees wasps exuvia thin membranous becomes crumpled shed
pupal matingedit




mating pierid catopsilia pyranthe male newly emerged female


taxa lepidoptera especially heliconius pupal mating extreme form reproductive strategy adult male mates female pupa emerge newly moulted female accompanied actions capping reproductive system female sphragis denying access males exuding antiaphrodisiac pheromone56
defenseedit
pupae usually immobile largely defenseless overcome common strategy concealed placement species lycaenid butterflies protected pupal stage ants another means defense pupae species capability making sounds vibrations scare potential predators species chemical defenses including toxic secretions pupae social hymenopterans protected adult members hive
typesedit
based presence absence articulated mandibles employed emerging cocoon pupal case pupae classified types78

decticous pupa pupae articulated mandibles examples pupae orders neuroptera mecoptera trichoptera lepidoptera families
adecticous pupa pupae without articulated mandibles examples include orders strepsiptera coleoptera hymenoptera diptera siphonaptera

based whether pupal appendages free attached body pupae classified three types9

exarate pupa appendages free usually encapsulated within cocoon decticous pupa adecticous pupa always exarate neuroptera trichoptera cyclorrhapha dipterans siphonaptera coleoptera hymenoptera lepidoptera
obtect pupa appendages attached closely body commonly encapsulated within cocoon adecticous pupa obtect forms lepidoptera nematocera brachycera dipterans staphylinidae chrysomelidae coleopterans many chalcidoidea hymenopterans
coarctate pupa enclosed hardened cuticle penultimate larval instar called puparium however pupa exarate adecticous pupa forms cyclorrhapha dipterans
