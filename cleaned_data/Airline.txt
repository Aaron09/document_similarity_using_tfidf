1978 airline industry deregulation lowered federally controlled barriers airlines downturn nations economy occurred startups entered downturn time found aircraft funding contracted hangar maintenance services trained employees recruited laid staff airlines
major airlines dominated routes aggressive pricing additional capacity offerings often swamping startups place high barriers entry imposed regulation major airlines implemented equally high barrier called loss leader pricing36 strategy already established dominant airline stomps competition lowering airfares specific routes cost operating choking chance startup airline industry side effect overall drop revenue service quality37 since deregulation 1978 average domestic ticket price dropped 4038 airline employee incurring massive losses airlines rely upon scourge cyclical chapter bankruptcy proceedings continue business39 america west airlines since merged airways remained significant survivor entrant dozens even hundreds gone
many ways biggest winner deregulated environment passenger although exclusively attributable deregulation indeed witnessed explosive growth demand travel many millions never rarely flown became regular fliers even joining frequent flyer loyalty programs receiving free flights benefits flying services higher frequencies meant business fliers could another city business return almost point country travels advantages long distance intercity railroad travel lines pressure latter withered away whilst former still protected nationalization continuing existence amtrak
