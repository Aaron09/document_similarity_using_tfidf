invention
main article invention radio
idea wireless communication predates discovery radio experiments wireless telegraphy inductive capacitive induction transmission ground water even train tracks 1830s james clerk maxwell showed theoretical mathematical form 1864 electromagnetic waves could propagate free space23 likely first intentional transmission signal means electromagnetic waves performed experiment david edward hughes around 1880 although considered induction time 1888 heinrich rudolf hertz able conclusively prove transmitted airborne electromagnetic waves experiment confirming maxwells theory electromagnetism
discovery hertzian waves would take almost years term radio universally adopted type electromagnetic radiation4 many scientists inventors experimented wireless transmission trying develop system communication intentionally using hertzian waves maxwells theory showing light hertzian electromagnetic waves phenomenon different wavelengths maxwellian scientist john perry frederick thomas trouton alexander trotter assume would analogous optical signaling56 serbian american engineer nikola tesla consider relatively useless communication since light could transmit line sight7 1892 physicist william crookes wrote possibilities wireless telegraphy based hertzian waves8 1893 tesla proposed system transmitting intelligence wireless power using earth medium9 others amos dolbear oliver lodge reginald fessenden10 alexander popov11 involved development components theory involved transmission reception airborne electromagnetic waves theoretical work potential means communication
several years starting 1894 italian inventor guglielmo marconi built first complete commercially successful wireless telegraphy system based airborne hertzian waves radio transmission12 marconi demonstrated application radio military marine communications started company development propagation radio communication services equipment
19th century
meaning usage word radio developed parallel developments within field communications seen three distinct phases electromagnetic waves experimentation wireless communication technical development radio broadcasting commercialization 1864 presentation published 1865 james clerk maxwell proposed theories mathematical proofs electromagnetism showed light phenomena types electromagnetic waves propagating free space23131415 1886–88 heinrich rudolf hertz conducted series experiments proved existence maxwells electromagnetic waves using frequency would later called radio spectrum many individuals—inventors engineers developers businessmen—constructed systems based understanding phenomena predating maxwell hertzs discoveries thus wireless telegraphy radio wavebased systems attributed multiple inventors development laboratory demonstration commercial entity spanned several decades required efforts many practitioners
1878 david hughes noticed sparks could heard telephone receiver experimenting carbon microphone developed carbonbased detector eventually could detect signals hundred yards demonstrated discovery royal society 1880 told merely induction therefore abandoned research thomas edison came across electromagnetic phenomenon experimenting telegraph menlo park noted unexplained transmission effect experimenting telegraph referred etheric force announcement november 1875 elihu thomson published findings edisons force attributing induction explanation edison accepted edison would next year take patent 465971 system electrical wireless communication ships based electrostatic coupling using water elevated terminals although radio system marconi company would purchase rights 1903 protect themclarification needed legally lawsuits16
hertzian waves
1886 1888 heinrich rudolf hertz published results experiments able transmit electromagnetic waves radio waves proving maxwells electromagnetic theory1718 early discovery radio waves referred hertzian waves19 1890 1892 physicists john perry frederick thomas trouton william crookes proposed electromagnetic hertzian waves navigation means communication crookes writing possibilities wireless telegraphy based hertzian waves 18928
learning hertz demonstrations wireless transmission inventor nikola tesla began developing system based hertz maxwells ideas primarily means wireless lighting power distribution2021 tesla concluding hertz demonstrated airborne electromagnetic waves radio transmission went develop system based thought primary conductor earth22 1893 demonstrations ideas louis missouri franklin institute philadelphia tesla proposed wireless power technology could also incorporate system telecommunication information
lecture work hertz shortly death professor oliver lodge alexander muirhead demonstrated wireless signaling using hertzian radio waves lecture theater oxford university museum natural history august 1894 demonstration radio signal sent neighboring clarendon laboratory building received apparatus lecture theater
building work lodge23 indian bengali physicist jagadish chandra bose ignited gunpowder rang bell distance using millimeter range wavelength microwaves november 1894 public demonstration town hall kolkata bose wrote bengali essay adrisya alok invisible light invisible light easily pass brick walls buildings therefore messages transmitted means without mediation wires bose’s first scientific paper polarisation electric rays doublerefracting crystals communicated asiatic society bengal 1895 second paper communicated royal society london lord rayleigh october 1895 december 1895 london journal electrician published bose’s paper electropolariscope time word coherer coined lodge used englishspeaking world hertzian wave receivers detectors electrician readily commented bose’s coherer december 1895 englishman january 1896 quoted electrician commented follows professor bose succeed perfecting patenting ‘coherer’ time whole system coast lighting throughout navigable world revolutionised indian bengali scientist working single handed presidency college laboratory bose planned perfect coherer never thought patenting
1895 conducting experiments along lines hertzs research alexander stepanovich popov built first radio receiver contained coherer refined lightning detector presented russian physical chemical society 1895 depiction popovs lightning detector printed journal russian physical chemical society year publication minutes 15201 session december issue journal rpcs24 earlier description device given dmitry aleksandrovich lachinov july 1895 edition course fundamentals meteorology climatology first russia2526 popovs receiver created improved basis lodges receiver originally intended reproduction experiments
marconi




british post office engineers inspect guglielmo marconis wireless telegraphy radio equipment 1897


1894 young italian inventor guglielmo marconi began working idea building commercial wireless telegraphy system based hertzian waves radio waves line inquiry noted inventors seem pursuing27 marconi read literature used ideas others experimenting radio waves great deal develop devices portable transmitters receiver systems could work long distances12 turning essentially laboratory experiment useful communication system28 august 1895 marconi field testing system even improvements able transmit signals onehalf mile distance oliver lodge predicted 1894 maximum transmission distance radio waves marconi raised height antenna upon idea grounding transmitter receiver improvements system capable transmitting signals miles hills29 marconis experimental apparatus proved first engineeringcomplete commercially successful radio transmission system303132 marconi’s apparatus also credited saving people survived tragic titanic disaster33
1896 marconi awarded british patent 12039 improvements transmitting electrical impulses signals apparatus therefor first patent ever issued hertzian wave radio wave base wireless telegraphic system34 1897 established radio station isle wight england marconi opened wireless factory former silkworks hall street chelmsford england 1898 employing around people shortly 1900s marconi held patent rights radio marconi would nobel prize physics 190935 successful inventor ability commercialize radio associated equipment global business12 subsequent patented refinements original radio patent would overturned 1935 court case upheld supreme court 194336

licensed commercial public radio stations
question first publicly targeted licensed radio station answer depends semantics settlement first question hang largely upon constitutes regular programming
