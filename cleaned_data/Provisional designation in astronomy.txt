permanent instead provisional designation minor planets minor planet designation
current system provisional designation minor planets asteroids centaurs transneptunian objects place since 1925 superseded several previous conventions rendered obsolete increasing numbers minor planet discoveries modern newstyle provisional designation consists year discovery followed letters optionally suffixed number4
newstyle provisional designationedit
example provisional designation 2016 ek156 stands 3910th body identified 1–15 march 2016

2016 first element indicates year discovery
first letter indicates halfmonth objects discovery within year ranges first half january second half december letters used table first half always 15th month regardless numbers days second half thus indicates period march
k156 second letter numerical suffix indicate order discovery within halfmonth first discoveries halfmonth receive letter without suffix letter used modern techniques typically yield hundreds thousands discoveries halfmonth subscript number appended indicate number times letters cycled suffix indicates completed cycles cycles letters 3900 10th position current cycle thus k156 stands 3910th minor planet discovered halfmonth

historical designationsedit
first four minor planets discovered early 19th century lengthy discovery fifth astronomers initially reason believe would countless thousands minor planets strove assign symbol discovery tradition symbols used major planets example ceres assigned stylized sickle pallas lozenge crossed handle juno venus mirror crowned star later became star crossed handle vesta sacred fire altar
soon became apparent though continuing assign symbols impractical provided assistance number known minor planets tens johann franz encke introduced system berliner astronomisches jahrbuch 1854 published 1851 used encircled numbers instead symbols enckes system began numbering astrea given number went eunomia ceres pallas juno vesta continued denoted symbols following years numbering changed astraea number
system found popularity among astronomers since final designation minor planet number indicating order discovery followed name even adoption system though several minor planets received symbols including bellona whip lance mars martial sister8 leukothea ancient lighthouse9 fides latin cross according websters dictionary english language four minor planets also given symbols psyche thetis proserpina amphitrite11 however evidence symbols ever used outside initial publication astronomische nachrichten
genesis current systemedit
several different notation symbolic schemes used latter half nineteenth century present form first appeared journal astronomische nachrichten 1892 numbers assigned receipt discovery announcement permanent designation assigned orbit calculated object
first provisional designation consisted year discovery followed letter indicating sequence discovery omitting letter historically sometimes omitted instead scheme badenia initially designated 1892 erigone 1892 1893 though increasing numbers discoveries forced revision system double letters instead sequence sequence double letters restarted year 1894 followed 1893 1916 letters reached rather starting series tripleletter designations doubleletter series restarted 1916
considerable amount time could sometimes elapse exposing photographic plates astronomical survey actually spotting small solar system object witness story phoebes discovery even actual discovery delivery message farflung observatory central authority became necessary retrofit discoveries sequence discoveries still dated based images taken human realised looking something doubleletter scheme generally possible designations assigned subsequent year scheme used round problem rather clumsy used designation consisting year lowercase letter manner similar provisionaldesignation scheme comets example 1915 note space year letter distinguish designation oldstyle comet designation 1915a mellishs first comet 1915 1917 1914 designations form year plus greek letter used addition

cometsedit
main article naming comets
system used comets complex previous 1995 originally year followed space roman numeral indicating sequence discovery cases difficulties always arose object needed placed previous discoveries example comet 1881 comet 1881 might reported object discovered discovery dates reported much later couldnt designated comet 1881 iii½ commonly comets known discoverers name year alternate scheme also listed comets order time perihelion passage using lowercase letters thus comet faye modern designation 4pfaye comet 1881 first comet discovered 1881 comet 1880c third comet pass perihelion 1880 —note comet discovered vicinity
system since 1995 similar provisional designation minor planets13 comets provisional designation consists year discovery space letter unlike minor planets indicating halfmonth discovery within year afirst half january bsecond half january skipping avoid confusion number numeral reaching finally number subscripted minor planets indicating sequence discovery thus eighth comet discovered second half march 2006 would given provisional designation 2006 whilst tenth comet late march would 2006
comet splits segments given provisional designation suffixed letter presumes tracking beyond fragments unlikely
object originally found asteroidal later develops cometary tail retains asteroidal designation example minor planet 1954 turned comet faye thus 4p1954 designations said comet similarly minor planet 1999 re70 reclassified comet discovered linear known 176plinear linear 118401 linear
provisional designations comets given condensed packed form manner minor planets 2006 periodic comet would listed minor planet database pk06f080 last character purposely zero allows comet minor planet designations overlap
periodic cometsedit
comets assigned four possible prefixes rough classification prefix example p1997 comet gehrels designates periodic comet orbital period less years observed single perihelion passage 153pikeyazhang whose period years receive permanent number prefix second observed perihelion passage list periodic comets
nonperiodic cometsedit
comets fulfill periodic requirements receive prefix c2006 great comet 2007 noted nonperiodic comets switch later fulfill requirements comets lost disintegrated prefixed d1993 comet shoemakerlevy finally comets known historical records reliable orbit could calculated prefixed example x1106 also list nonperiodic comets list hyperbolic comets
satellites rings planetsedit
satellites rings first discovered given provisional designations s2000 11th satellite jupiter discovered 2000 s2005 first satellite pluto discovered 2005 r2004 second ring saturn discovered 2004 initial stands satellite ring respectively distinguishing designation prefixes used comets designations sometimes written s2005 dropping second space
prefix indicates natural satellite followed year using year discovery image acquired necessarily date discovery oneletter code written upper case identifies planet jupiter saturn respectively list oneletter abbreviations number identifies sequentially observation example naiad innermost moon neptune first designated s1989 later existence orbit confirmed received full designation neptune naiad
roman numbering system arose first discovery natural satellites earths moon galileo referred galilean moons counting jupiter outward part spite rival simon marius proposed names adopted similar numbering schemes naturally arose discovery moons around saturn mars although numbers initially designated moons orbital sequence discoveries soon failed conform scheme jupiter amalthea orbits closer jupiter unstated convention became close 19th century numbers less reflected order discovery except prior historical exceptions timeline discovery solar system planets natural satellites convention extended natural satellites minor planets sylvia romulus
moons minor planetsedit
provisional designation system minor planet satellites asteroid moons follows established satellites major planets minor planets planet letter code replaced minor planet number parentheses thus first observed moon sylvia discovered 2001 first designated s2001 later receiving permanent designation sylvia romulus moon discovered roman numerals specify discovery sequence sylvias second moon designated sylvia remus
