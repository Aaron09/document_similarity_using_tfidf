samplingedit
census often construed opposite sample intent count everyone population rather fraction however population censuses rely sampling frame count population sure everyone included otherwise responding would followed individuals could missed fundamental premise census population known estimate made analysis primary data sampling frame counterintuitive suggests population size already known however census also used collect attribute data individuals nation process sampling marks difference historical census house house process product imperial decree modern statistical project sampling frame used census almost always address register thus known anyone resident many people household depending mode enumeration form sent householder enumerator calls administrative records dwelling accessed preliminary dispatch forms census workers check address problems ground seem straightforward postal service file purpose date dwellings contain number independent households particular problem termed communal establishments category includes student residences religious orders homes elderly people prisons easily enumerated single householder often treated differently visited special teams census workers ensure classified appropriately
residence definitionsedit
individuals normally counted within households information typically collected household structure housing reason international documents refer censuses population housing normally census response made household indicating details individuals resident important aspect census enumerations determining individuals counted cannot counted broadly three definitions used facto residence jure residence permanent residence important consider individuals multiple temporary addresses every person identified uniquely resident place happen census facto residence best place count individual uses services useful usual jure residence individual represented permanent address perhaps family home students long term migrants necessary precise definition residence decide whether visitors country included population count becoming important students travel abroad education period several years groups causing problems enumeration born babies refugees people away holiday people moving home around census people without fixed address people second homes working another part country retaining holiday cottage difficult particular address sometimes causing double counting houses mistakenly identified vacant another problem people different address different times students living place education term time returning family home vacations children whose parents separated effectively family homes census enumeration always based finding people live systematic alternative list could find people derived census activities first place recent guidelines provide recommendation enumerating complex households5
enumeration strategiesedit
historical censuses used crude enumeration assuming absolute accuracy modern approaches take account problems overcount undercount coherence census enumerations official sources data6 reflects realist approach measurement acknowledging definition residence true value population never measured complete accuracy important aspect census process evaluate quality data7
many countries postenumeration survey adjust census counts8 works similar manner capturerecapture estimation animal populations census circles method called dual system enumeration sample households visited interviewers record details household census data matched census records number people missed estimated considering number missed census survey counted counts adjusted nonresponse varying different demographic groups explanation using fishing analogy found trout catfish roach9 award royal statistical society excellence official statistics 2011




enumerator conducting survey using mobile phone based questionnaire rural zimbabwe


triple system enumeration proposed improvement would allow evaluation statistical dependence pairs sources however matching process difficult aspect census estimation never implemented national enumeration would also difficult identify three different sources sufficiently different make triple system effort worthwhile approach another weakness assumes person counted twice count facto residence definitions would problem jure definitions individuals risk recorded form leading double counting particular problem students often term time family address
several countries used system known short formlong form10 sampling strategy randomly chooses proportion people send detailed questionnaire long form everyone receives short form questions thereby data collected imposing burden whole population also reduces burden statistical office indeed residents required fill whole form sample coded analysed detail 200111 technology means data scanned processed recently controversy canada cessation long form head munir sheikh resigning12
alternative enumeration strategies increasing13 simple many people assume occur developed countries14 netherlands advanced adopting census using administrative data allows simulated census conducted linking several different administrative databases agreed time data matched overall enumeration established accounting different sources discrepant validation survey still conducted similar post enumeration survey employed traditional census countries population register basis census statistics needed users common amongst nordic countries requires large number different registers combined including population housing employment education registers combined brought standard statistical register comparing data different sources ensuring quality sufficient official statistics produced15 recent innovation french instigation rolling census programme different regions enumerated year whole country completely enumerated every years16 europe connection 2010 census round large number countries adopted alternative census methodologies often based combination data registers surveys sources17
technologyedit
censuses evolved technology latest censuses 2010 round using many types computing brazil handheld devices used enumerators locate residences ground many countries census returns could made internet well paper form facilitated computer matching techniques automated propensity score matching census formats scanned stored electronically destroyed replacing need physical archives record linking perform administrative census would possible without large databases stored computer systems
technology without problems introduction census intended handheld computers cost escalated abandoned contract sold brazil online response good idea functions census make sure everyone counted accurately system allowed people enter address without verification would open abuse therefore households verified ground typically enumerator visit post paper forms still necessary without access internet connections also possible hidden nature administrative census means users engaged importance contributing data official statistics
alternatively population estimations carried remotely remote sensing technologies18

census developmentedit
according unfpa “the information generated population housing census numbers people distribution living conditions data critical development” type data essential policymakers know invest unfortunately many countries outdated inaccurate data populations therefore without accurate data unable address needs population
unfpa stated that19
“the unique advantage census represents entire statistical universe smallest geographical units country region planners need information kinds development work including assessing demographic trends analysing socioeconomic conditions20 designing evidencebased povertyreduction strategies monitoring evaluating effectiveness policies tracking progress toward national internationally agreed development goals”
addition making policymakers aware population issues also important tool identifying forms social demographic economic exclusions inequalities relating race ethics religion well disadvantaged groups disabilities poor
accurate census empower local communities providing necessary information participate local decisionmaking ensuring represented
uses census dataedit
nineteenth century first censuses collected paper enumerations collated hand statistical uses basic government owned data able publish statistics state nation21 uses measure changes population apportion representation population estimates could compared countries
beginning twentieth century censuses recording households indications employment countries census archives released public examination many decades allowing genealogists track ancestry interested people archives provide substantial historical record challenge established notions tradition also possible understand societal history titles arrangements destitute sick
politics surround census many countries canada 2010 example government leadership stephen harper abolished mandatory longform census decision longform census response protests canadians resented personal questions longform census reinstated justin trudeau government 2016
census data researchedit
governments assumed responsibility schooling welfare large government research departments made extensive census data actuarial estimates could made project populations plan provision local government regions also possible central government allocate funding basis census data even twentieth century census data directly accessible large government departments however computers meant tabulations could used directly university researchers large businesses local government offices could detail data answer questions local specialist knowledge
census data published wide variety formats accessible business levels governance media students teachers charities citizen interested researchers particular interest role census field officers assistants23 data represented visually analysed complex statistical models show difference certain areas understand association different personal characteristics census data offer unique insight small areas small demographic groups sample data would unable capture precision
privacyedit
although census provides useful obtaining statistical information population information sometimes lead abuses political otherwise made possible linking individuals identities anonymous census data24 consideration particularly important individuals census responses made available microdata form even aggregatelevel data result privacy breaches dealing small areas andor rare subpopulations
instance reporting data large city might appropriate give average income black males aged however town black males group would breach privacy either persons knowing income reported average could determine mans income
typically census data processed obscure individual information agencies intentionally introducing small statistical errors prevent identification individuals marginal populations25 others swap variables similar respondents whatever measures taken reduce privacy risk census data technology form better electronic analysis data poses increasing challenges protection sensitive individual information known statistical disclosure control
another possibility present survey results means statistical models form multivariate distribution mixture26 statistical information form conditional distributions histograms derived interactively estimated mixture model without access original database final product contain protected microdata model based interactive software distributed without confidentiality concerns
another method simply release data except large scale data directly central government different release strategies government international project ipums coordinate access microdata corresponding metadata projects also promote standardising metadata projects sdmx best made minimal data available
