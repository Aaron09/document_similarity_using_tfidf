global climate paleogene departed humid conditions late mesozoic began cooling drying trend despite periodically disrupted warm periods paleocene–eocene thermal maximum persists today trend partly caused formation antarctic circumpolar current significantly lowered oceanic water temperatures
paleogene continents continued drift closer current positions india process colliding asia subsequently forming himalayas atlantic ocean continued widen centimeters year africa moving north meet europe form mediterranean south america moving closer north america would later connect isthmus panama inland seas retreated north america early period australia also separated antarctica drifting toward southeast asia
