exploitation matter surplus labour—the amount labour performs beyond receives goods exploitation socioeconomic feature every class society principal features distinguishing social classes power social class control means production enables exploitation classes
capitalism labour theory value operative concern value commodity equals socially necessary labour time required produce condition surplus value difference value produced value received labourer synonymous term surplus labour thus capitalist exploitation realised deriving surplus value worker
precapitalist economies exploitation worker achieved physical coercion capitalist mode production result subtly achieved worker means production must voluntarily enter exploitive work relationship capitalist order earn necessities life workers entry employment voluntary chooses capitalist work however worker must work starve thus exploitation inevitable voluntary nature worker participating capitalist society illusory

bourgeoisie means production labour power proletariat thus exploiting proletariat subdivide bourgeoisie petite bourgeoisie

petite bourgeoisie work afford little labour power small business owners peasant landlords trade workers marxism predicts continual reinvention means production eventually would destroy petite bourgeoisie degrading middle class proletariat

landlords historically important social class retain wealth power
peasantry farmers scattered class incapable organizing effecting socioeconomic change would enter proletariat would become landlords

class consciousness denotes awareness—of social world—that social class possesses capacity rationally best interests hence class consciousness required effect successful revolution thus dictatorship proletriat
without defining ideology23 marx used term describe production images social reality according engels ideology process accomplished socalled thinker consciously true false consciousness real motive forces impelling remain unknown otherwise simply would ideological process hence imagines false seeming motive forces24 ruling class controls societys means production superstructure society ruling social ideas determined best interests ruling class german ideology ideas ruling class every epoch ruling ideas class ruling material force society time ruling intellectual force25
