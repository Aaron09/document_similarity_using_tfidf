coal fossil fuels


fossil fuel fuel formed natural processes anaerobic decomposition buried dead organisms containing energy originating ancient photosynthesis1 organisms resulting fossil fuels typically millions years sometimes exceeds million years2 fossil fuels contain high percentages carbon include petroleum coal natural gas3 commonly used derivatives include kerosene propane fossil fuels range volatile materials carbon hydrogen ratios like methane liquids like petroleum nonvolatile materials composed almost pure carbon like anthracite coal methane found hydrocarbon fields either alone associated form methane clathrates
theory fossil fuels formed fossilized remains dead plants4 exposure heat pressure earths crust millions years5 first introduced georgius agricola 1556 later mikhail lomonosov 18th century
united states energy information administration estimates 2007 primary sources energy consisted petroleum coal natural amounting share fossil fuels primary energy consumption world6 nonfossil sources 2006 included nuclear hydroelectric others geothermal solar tidal wind wood waste amounting world energy consumption growing year
although fossil fuels continually formed natural processes generally considered nonrenewable resources take millions years form known viable reserves depleted much faster ones made89
fossil fuels raises serious environmental concerns burning fossil fuels produces around billion tonnes gigatonnes carbon dioxide year estimated natural processes absorb half amount increase 1065 billion tonnes atmospheric carbon dioxide year10 carbon dioxide greenhouse increases radiative forcing contributes global warming global movement towards generation renewable energy underway help reduce global greenhouse emissions

aquatic phytoplankton zooplankton died sedimented large quantities anoxic conditions millions years began forming petroleum natural result anaerobic decomposition geological time organic matter mixed became buried heavy layers inorganic sediment resulting high levels heat pressure caused organic matter chemically alter first waxy material known kerogen found shales heat liquid gaseous hydrocarbons process known catagenesis despite heat driven transformations increase energy density compared typical organic matter embedded energy still photosynthetic origin1
terrestrial plants hand tended form coal methane many coal fields date carboniferous period earths history terrestrial plants also form type kerogen source natural
wide range organic hydrocarbon compounds given fuel mixture specific mixture hydrocarbons gives fuel characteristic properties boiling point melting point density viscosity fuels like natural instance contain boiling gaseous components others gasoline diesel contain much higher boiling components

main article environmental impact energy industry
united states holds less worlds population large houses private cars uses worlds supply fossil fuels25 largest source greenhouse emissions fossil fuel combustion accounted percent weighted emissions 199826 combustion fossil fuels also produces pollutants nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide volatile organic compounds heavy metals
according environment canada

carbon dioxide variations last 400000 years showing rise since industrial revolution


according scientist jerry mahlman today mahlman crafted ipcc language used define levels scientific certainty says report blame feet fossil fuels virtual certainty meaning sure thats significant jump likely sure groups last report 2001 mahlman says role years effort involved spending months reviewing 1600 pages research went assessment28
combustion fossil fuels generates sulfuric carbonic nitric acids fall earth acid rain impacting natural areas built environment monuments sculptures made marble limestone particularly vulnerable acids dissolve calcium carbonate
fossil fuels also contain radioactive materials mainly uranium thorium released atmosphere 2000 12000 tonnes thorium 5000 tonnes uranium released worldwide burning coal29 estimated 1982 coal burning released times much radioactivity atmosphere three mile island accident30
burning coal also generates large amounts bottom materials used wide variety applications utilizing example production31
harvesting processing distributing fossil fuels also create environmental concerns coal mining methods particularly mountaintop removal strip mining negative environmental impacts offshore drilling poses hazard aquatic organisms refineries also negative environmental impacts including water pollution transportation coal requires dieselpowered locomotives crude typically transported tanker ships requires combustion additional fossil fuels
environmental regulation uses variety approaches limit emissions commandandcontrol mandates amount pollution technology used economic incentives voluntary programs
example regulation implementing policies reduce airborne mercury emissions regulations issued 2005 coalfired power plants need reduce emissions percent 201832
economic terms pollution fossil fuels regarded negative externality taxation considered make societal costs explicit order internalize cost pollution aims make fossil fuels expensive thereby reducing amount pollution associated along raising funds necessary counteract factorscitation needed
according rodman griffin burning coal saved inestimable amounts time labor substantially raising living standards around world33 although fossil fuels seem beneficial lives playing role global warming said dangerous future33
moreover environmental pollutions impacts human beings particles fossil fuel cause negative health effects inhaled people health effects include premature death acute respiratory illness aggravated asthma chronic bronchitis decreased lung function poor undernourished young people preexisting respiratory disease health risk34
