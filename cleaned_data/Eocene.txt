early eocene equable climate problemedit
unique features eocene’s climate mentioned equable homogeneous climate existed early parts eocene multitude proxies support presence warmer equable climate present period time proxies include presence fossils native warm climates crocodiles located higher latitudes1718 presence highlatitudes frostintolerant flora palm trees cannot survive sustained freezes1819 fossils snakes found tropics would require much higher average temperatures sustain them18 using isotope proxies determine ocean temperatures indicates surface temperatures tropics high relative present values bottom water temperatures higher19 bottom water temperatures temperatures areas deepwater forms near poles unable much cooler bottom water temperatures
issue arises however trying model eocene reproduce results found proxy data20 using different ranges greenhouse gasses occurred early eocene models unable produce warming found poles reduced seasonality occurs winters poles substantially warmer models accurately predicting tropics tend produce significantly cooler temperatures colder actual determined temperature poles19 error classified “equable climate problem” solve problem solution would involve finding process warm poles without warming tropics hypotheses tests attempt find process listed
large lakesedit
nature water opposed land less temperature variability would present large body water also present attempt mitigate cooling polar temperatures large lakes proposed mitigate seasonal climate changes21 replicate case lake inserted north america climate model using varying carbon dioxide levels model runs concluded lake reduce seasonality region greater increase carbon dioxide addition large lake unable reduce seasonality levels shown floral faunal data
ocean heat transportedit

test polar stratospheric clouds effects eocene climate models comparing effects polar stratospheric clouds poles increase atmospheric carbon dioxide24 polar stratospheric clouds warming effect poles increasing temperatures winter months multitude feedbacks also occurred models polar stratospheric clouds’ presence growth slowed immensely would lead present melting poles affected change temperature tropics unaffected increase atmospheric carbon dioxide would also cause tropics increase temperature warming troposphere increased greenhouse effect polar stratospheric clouds stratosphere would cool would potentially increase amount polar stratospheric clouds
polar stratospheric clouds could explain reduction equator pole temperature gradient increased temperatures poles early eocene drawbacks maintaining polar stratospheric clouds extended period time separate model runs used determine sustainability polar stratospheric clouds26 methane would need continually released sustained maintain lower stratospheric water vapor increasing amounts condensation nuclei would need high polar stratospheric cloud sustain eventually expand
