draftingedit
tactics based aerodynamic benefit drafting whereby rider significantly reduce required pedal effort closely following slipstream rider front riding main field peloton save much energy employed forward motion compared riding alone4 teams designate leader rest team charged keeping wind good position critical section race used strength weakness competitors riders cooperate draft ride high speed paceline echelon rider competitors wheel forcing greater share work maintaining pace potentially tire earlier drafting permitted individual time trials
breaksedit
group riders breaks away break peloton space freedom therefore advantage certain situations working together smoothly efficiently small group maintain higher speed peloton remaining riders motivated organized chase effectively5 usually rider group riders break peloton attacking riding ahead reduce number contenders break succeed body cyclists comes back together sprinter often overpowering competitors final stretch6 teamwork riders prearranged adhoc important many aspects preventing helping successful break sometimes delivering sprinter front field7
terrain conditionsedit
make course selective races often feature difficult sections tough climbs fast descents sometimes technical surfaces cobbled pavé used paris–roubaix race stronger riders able drop weaker riders sections reducing number direct competitors able take also weather discriminating factor
climbsedit
climbs excellent places single rider break away bunch lower riding speeds climb seriously reduce drafting advantage bunch escaping rider capitalize position descent going downhill singly allows maneuvering space therefore higher speeds bunch addition bunch riders keeping space safety reasons drafting benefits reduced action takes place relatively close target another bunch ahead finish ride flatter terrain descent long enough drafting effect working full power make bunch catch making climb escape even attractive
crosswindsedit
wind conditions also make otherwise routine sections course potentially selective cyclists finding three fourspoked composite front wheels stable confronting crosswinds8 crosswinds particularly alter position shadow drafting rider usually placing diagonally behind lead rider9 take advantage attacking rider rides high speed front peloton opposite side road crosswind blowing following riders unable fully shelter wind tactics maintained long enough weaker rider somewhere line unable keep contact rider directly ahead causing peloton split up10
speededit
well exceptional fitness successful riders must develop excellent bike handling skills order ride high speeds close quarters riders individual riders approach speeds descending winding mountain roads reach 60–80 37–50 level speeds final sprint finish line
gruppettoedit
organized races wagon support gear broom wagon follows race pick stragglers professional stage racing particularly tour france riders position race assist teammate usually attempt ride finish within specified percentage winners finishing time permitted start next days stage often riders situation band together minimize effort required finish within time limit group riders known gruppetto autobus oneday racing professionals longer chance affect race outcome routinely withdraw even uninjured capable riding finish
teamsedit
principle remains winner first cross line many riders grouped together teams usually commercial sponsors professional semiprofessional teams team names typically synonymous primary sponsors example prominent professional teams last years team telekom lottonl–jumbo mapei lampre11 size team varies three amateur event club riders dozen professional races team riders decide race best chance winning choice depend hills chances whole field finish together sprint factors riders team domestiques devote promoting leaders chances taking turns wind refusing chase peloton escapes goal allow leader enough energy take critical point race victory
