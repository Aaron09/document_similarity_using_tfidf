armstrongs feed back circuit drawing radio broadcast 1922


armstrong began working first major invention still undergraduate columbia late 1906 forest invented threeelement triode grid audion vacuumtube vacuum tubes worked understood time forests initial audions high vacuum developed blue glow modest plate voltages forest improved vacuum federal telegraph14 1912 vacuum tubes worked understood advantages high vacuum tubes appreciated
growing armstrong experimented early temperamental gassy audions spurred later discoveries developed keen interest gaining detailed scientific understanding vacuumtubes worked conjunction professor morecroft used oscillograph conduct comprehensive studies15 breakthrough discovery determining employing positive feedback also known regeneration produced amplification hundreds times greater previously attained amplified signals strong enough receivers could loudspeakers instead headphones investigation revealed feedback increased beyond certain level vacuumtube would oscillation thus could also used continuouswave radio transmitter
beginning 1913 armstrong prepared series comprehensive demonstrations papers carefully documented research16 late 1913 applied patent protection covering regenerative circuit october 1914 patent 1113149 issued discovery17 although forest initially discounted armstrongs findings beginning 1915 forest filed series competing patent applications largely copied armstrongs claims stating discovered regeneration first based august 1912 notebook entry working federal telegraph company prior january 1913 date recognized armstrong result interference hearing patent office determine priority forest inventor involved four competing claimants included armstrong forest general electrics langmuir alexander meissner german national application seized office alien property custodian world
following world armstrong enlisted representation firm pennie davis martin edmonds order finance legal expenses began issuing nontransferable licenses regenerative patents select group small radio equipment firms november 1920 seventeen companies licensed19 licensees paid royalties sales restricted amateurs experimenters meanwhile armstrong reviewed options selling commercial rights work although obvious candidate radio corporation america october 1920 westinghouse electric manufacturing company took option 335000 commercial rights regenerative superheterodyne patents additional 200000 paid armstrong prevailed regenerative patent dispute westinghouse exercised option november 192020
legal proceedings related regeneration patent became separated groups court cases initial court action triggered 1919 armstrong sued forests company district court alleging infringement patent 1113149 court ruled armstrongs favor 1921 second line court cases result patent office interference hearing would different outcome interference board also sided armstrong unwilling settle forest less considered full compensation thus pressured forest decided continue legal defense appealed interference board decision district columbia district court 1924 court ruled forest considered regenerations inventor armstrong along much engineering community shocked course events side appealed unexpected decision although legal proceeding twice went supreme court 1928 1934 unsuccessful overturning decision21
response second supreme court decision upholding forest inventor regeneration armstrong attempted return 1917 medal honor awarded recognition work publications dealing action oscillating nonoscillating audion however organizations board refused issued statement strongly affirms original award

united states entered world april 1917 later year armstrong commissioned captain army signal corps assigned laboratory paris france help develop radio communication allied effort returned united states fall 1919 promoted rank major7 world wars armstrong gave military free patents
period armstrongs significant accomplishment development supersonic heterodyne soon shortened superheterodyne radio receiver circuit2 circuit made radio receivers sensitive selective still extensively used today feature superheterodyne approach mixing incoming radio signal locally generated different frequency signal within radio circuit typically referred mixer result fixed unchanging intermediate frequency signal easily amplified detected subsequent circuit stages follow mixer 1919 armstrong filed application patent superheterodyne circuit issued next year patent subsequently sold westinghouse22 patent would challenged however triggering another patent office interference hearing23 armstrong ultimately lost patent battle although outcome less controversial involving regeneration proceedings24
challenger lucien lévy france also worked developing allied radio communication world awarded french patents 1917 1918 covered basic ideas used armstrongs superheterodyne receiver interested radio development time primarily pointtopoint extensions wired telephone exchanges purchased rights lévys patent contested armstrongs grant subsequent court reviews continued 1928 district columbia court appeals disallowed nine claims armstrongs patent assigning priority seven claims lévy ernst alexanderson general electric burton kendall bell laboratories25
although early radio receivers used regeneration armstrong approached rcas david sarnoff known since giving demonstration regeneration receiver 1913 corporation offering superheterodynes superior offering general public26 ongoing patent dispute hindrance extensive crosslicensing agreements signed 1920 1921 westinghouse meant armstrong could freely lévy patent superheterodyne sets initially thought prohibitively complicated expensive initial designs required multiple tuning knobs used nine vacuumtubes however conjunction engineers armstrong developed simpler less costly design introduced superheterodyne radiola sets market early 1924 immediate success dramatically increasing corporations profits sets considered valuable would license superheterodyne manufacturing companies 193023

wideband radioedit
static interference extraneous noises caused sources thunderstorms electrical equipment bedeviled early radio communication using amplitude modulation perplexed numerous inventors attempting eliminate many ideas static elimination investigated little success mid1920s armstrong began researching whether could come solution initially unsuccessfully attempted resolve problem modifying characteristics existing transmissions
approach considered potential solution frequency modulation transmissions order encode audio instead varying technically known modulating amplitude strength radio signal done transmissions frequency varied however 1922 john renshaw carson inventor singlesideband modulation published proceedings paper included detailed mathematical analysis showed transmissions provide improvement am28 although carson bandwidth rule still important today review turned incomplete analyzed known narrowband
early 1928 armstrong began researching capabilities frequency modulation although others involved research time knowledge project conducted engineers investigating whether shortwave transmissions less susceptible fading 1931 engineers constructed successful shortwave link transmitting schmelingstribling fight broadcast california hawaii noted time signals seemed less affected static project made little progress29
working secret basement laboratory columbias philosophy hall armstrong slowly developed eventually resulted wideband process discovering significant advantages earlier narrowband transmissions granted five patents covering basic features system december 193330 initially primary claim system effective filtering noise produced receivers vacuum tubes31
armstrong standing agreement give right first refusal patents 1934 made presentation system president sarnoff sarnoff somewhat taken aback complexity hoped would possible eliminate static merely adding simple device existing receivers 1934 october 1935 armstrong conducted field tests technology laboratory located 85th floor empire state building york city antenna attached buildings spire transmitted signals distances miles km32 tests helped demonstrate staticreduction highfidelity capabilities however heavily invested perfecting television broadcasting chose invest instructed armstrong remove equipment33
denied marketing financial clout would brought armstrong decided finance development form ties smaller members radio industry including zenith general electric promote invention armstrong thought potential replace stations within years promoted boost radio manufacturing industry suffering effects great depression since making existing radio transmitters receivers obsolete would necessitate stations replacement transmitters listeners purchase fmcapable receivers 1936 published landmark paper proceedings documented superior capabilities using wideband fm34 paper would reprinted august 1984 issue proceedings ieee35 year later paper murray crosby inventor crosby system stereo journal36 provided analysis wideband characteristics introduced concept threshold demonstrating superior signal noise ratio signal stronger certain level
june 1936 armstrong gave formal presentation system federal communications commission headquarters washington comparison played jazz record using conventional radio switched transmission united press correspondent present recounted wire service report audience engineers shut eyes would believed jazz band room extraneous sounds moreover several engineers said demonstration consider armstrongs invention important radio developments since first earphone crystal sets introduced armstrong quoted saying could visualize time distant ultrahigh frequency wave bands play leading role broadcasting although article noted switchover ultrahigh frequency system would mean junking present broadcasting equipment present receivers homes eventually causing expenditure billions dollars37
late 1930s technical advances made possible transmit higher frequencies investigated options increasing number broadcasting stations addition ideas better audio quality known highfidelity 1937 introduced became known apex band consisting broadcasting frequencies 4102 4398 standard broadcast band stations higher quality audio example frequency response 17000 station separations instead spacings used original band38 armstrong worked convince band broadcasting stations would superior approach year financed construction first radio station w2xmn later ke2xcc alpine jersey engineers believed transmissions using high frequencies would travel little farther lineofsight distances limited horizon however operating kilowatts station could clearly heard miles away matching daytime coverage full power 50kilowatt station39
studies comparing apex station transmissions armstrongs system concluded approach superior early 1940 held hearings whether establish commercial service following review announced establishment band effective january 1941 consisting forty khzwide channels band 4250 first five channels reserved educational stations existing apex stations notified would allowed operate january 1941 unless converted
although interest band station owners construction restrictions went place world limited growth service following world moved standardize frequency allocations area concern effects tropospheric sporadic propagation times reflected station signals great distances causing mutual interference particularly controversial proposal spearheaded band needed shifted higher frequencies order avoid potential problem reassignment fiercely opposed unneeded armstrong lost made decision final june 194540 allocated hundred channels 88–108 assigned former band government fixed mobile 42–44 television channel 44–50 mhz40 period allowing existing stations broadcast high bands ended midnight january 1949 time band transmitters shut officially making obsolete 39500041 receivers already purchased public original band although converters allowing band sets receive high band manufactured ultimately proved complicated install often expensive buying high band outright42
armstrong felt band reassignment inspired primarily desire cause disruption would limit ability challenge existing radio industry including rcas radio properties included radio network plus major networks including mutual change also thought favored elimination relaying stations would require radio stations lease wired links company particularly galling fact assigned channel 4450 segment band despite fact 1941 adopted sound part ntsc television standard moreover video portions standard even susceptible interference audio channel eventually deleted well broadcasts licensed frequencies higher united states frequencies longer widely used emergency first responders services moved mostly
although band shift economic setback still reason optimism book published 1946 charles siepmann heralded stations radios second chance43 late 1945 armstrong contracted john young founding member public relations firm young rubicam conduct national campaign promoting broadcasting especially educational institutions article placements promoting armstrong personally made general circulation publications including nation fortune york times atlantic monthly saturday evening post44
1940 offered armstrong 1000000 nonexclusive royaltyfree license patents refused offer primarily felt would unfair licensed companies royalties sales time impasse would come dominate armstrongs life countered conducting research eventually developing claimed noninfringing system corporation also encouraged companies stop paying royalties armstrong outraged turn events 1948 armstrong filed suit national broadcasting company accusing patent infringement deliberately oppose impair value invention requested treble damages although confident suit would successful result major monetary award protracted legal maneuvering followed eventually began impair finances especially primary patents expired late 195045
