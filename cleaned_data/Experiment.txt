overviewedit
scientific method experiment empirical procedure arbitrates competing models hypotheses23 researchers also experimentation test existing theories hypotheses support disprove them34
experiment usually tests hypothesis expectation particular process phenomenon works however experiment also answer whatif question without specific expectation experiment reveals confirm prior results experiment carefully conducted results usually either support disprove hypothesis according philosophies science experiment never prove hypothesis support hand experiment provides counterexample disprove theory hypothesis experiment must also control possible confounding factors—any factors would accuracy repeatability experiment ability interpret results confounding commonly eliminated scientific controls andor randomized experiments random assignment
engineering physical sciences experiments primary component scientific method used test theories hypotheses physical processes work particular conditions whether particular engineering process produce desired chemical compound typically experiments fields focus replication identical procedures hopes producing identical results replication random assignment uncommon
medicine social sciences prevalence experimental research varies widely across disciplines used however experiments typically follow form clinical trial experimental units usually individual human beings randomly assigned treatment control condition outcomes assessed5 contrast norms physical sciences focus typically average treatment effect difference outcomes treatment control groups another test statistic produced experiment6 single study typically involve replications experiment separate studies aggregated systematic review metaanalysis
various differences experimental practice branches science example agricultural research frequently uses randomized experiments test comparative effectiveness different fertilizers experimental economics often involves experimental tests theorized human behaviors without relying random assignment individuals treatment control conditions

main article history experiments
francis bacon 1561–1626 english philosopher scientist active 17th century became early influential supporter experimental science disagreed method answering scientific questions deduction described follows first determined question according resorts experience bending conformity placets leads like captive procession7 bacon wanted method relied repeatable observations experiments notably first ordered scientific method understand today

remains simple experience taken comes called accident sought experiment true method experience first lights candle hypothesis means candle shows arranges delimits experiment commencing experience duly ordered digested bungling erratic deducing axioms theories established axioms experiments8101

centuries followed people applied scientific method different areas made important advances discoveries example galileo galilei 15641642 accurately measured time experimented make accurate measurements conclusions speed falling body antoine lavoisier 17431794 french chemist used experiment describe areas combustion biochemistry develop theory conservation mass matter9 louis pasteur 18221895 used scientific method disprove prevailing theory spontaneous generation develop germ theory disease10 importance controlling potentially confounding variables welldesigned laboratory experiments preferred possible

experiments might categorized according number dimensions depending upon professional norms standards different fields study disciplines psychology political science true experiment method social research kinds variables independent variable manipulated experimenter dependent variable measured signifying characteristic true experiment randomly allocates subjects neutralize experimenter bias ensures large number iterations experiment controls confounding factors11
controlled experimentsedit
main articles scientific control design experiments
controlled experiment often compares results obtained experimental samples control samples practically identical experimental sample except aspect whose effect tested independent variable good example would drug trial sample group receiving drug would experimental group treatment group receiving placebo regular treatment would control many laboratory experiments good practice several replicate samples test performed positive control negative control results replicate samples often averaged replicates obviously inconsistent results samples discarded result experimental error step test procedure mistakenly omitted sample often tests done duplicate triplicate positive control procedure similar actual experimental test known previous experience give positive result negative control known give negative result positive control confirms basic conditions experiment able produce positive result even none actual experimental samples produce positive result negative control demonstrates baseline result obtained test produce measurable positive result often value negative control treated background value subtract test sample results sometimes positive control takes quadrant standard curve
example often used teaching laboratories controlled protein assay students might given fluid sample containing unknown student amount protein correctly perform controlled experiment determine concentration protein fluid sample usually called unknown sample teaching would equipped protein standard solution known protein concentration students could make several positive control samples containing various dilutions protein standard negative control samples would contain reagents protein assay protein example samples performed duplicate assay colorimetric assay spectrophotometer measure amount protein samples detecting colored complex formed interaction protein molecules molecules added illustration results diluted test samples compared results standard curve blue line illustration estimate amount protein unknown sample
controlled experiments performed difficult exactly control conditions experiment case experiment begins creating sample groups probabilistically equivalent means measurements traits similar among groups groups respond manner given treatment equivalency determined statistical methods take account amount variation individuals number individuals group fields microbiology chemistry little variation individuals group size easily millions statistical methods often bypassed simply splitting solution equal parts assumed produce identical sample groups
equivalent groups formed experimenter tries treat identically except variable wishes isolate human experimentation requires special safeguards outside variables placebo effect experiments generally double blind meaning neither volunteer researcher knows individuals control group experimental group data collected ensures effects volunteer treatment response knowledge treated
human experiments researchers give subject person stimulus subject responds goal experiment measure response stimulus test method

observational study used impractical unethical costprohibitive otherwise inefficient physical social system laboratory setting completely control confounding factors apply random assignment also used confounding factors either limited known well enough analyze data light though rare social phenomena examination observational science valid experimenter must know account confounding factors situations observational studies value often suggest hypotheses tested randomized experiments collecting fresh data
fundamentally however observational studies experiments definition observational studies lack manipulation required baconian experiments addition observational studies biological social systems often involve variables difficult quantify control observational studies limited lack statistical properties randomized experiments randomized experiment method randomization specified experimental protocol guides statistical analysis usually specified also experimental protocol13 without statistical model reflects objective randomization statistical analysis relies subjective model13 inferences subjective models unreliable theory practice14 fact several cases carefully conducted observational studies consistently give wrong results results observational studies inconsistent also differ results experiments example epidemiological studies colon cancer consistently show beneficial correlations broccoli consumption experiments find benefit15
particular problem observational studies involving human subjects great difficulty attaining fair comparisons treatments exposures studies prone selection bias groups receiving different treatments exposures differ greatly according covariates height weight medications exercise nutritional status ethnicity family medical history contrast randomization implies covariate mean group expected randomized trial variation mean expected course randomization ensures experimental groups mean values close central limit theorem markovs inequality inadequate randomization sample size systematic variation covariates treatment groups exposure groups makes difficult separate effect treatment exposure effects covariates measured mathematical models used analyze data must consider differing covariate measured results meaningful covariate neither randomized included model
avoid conditions render experiment less useful physicians conducting medical trials food drug administration approval quantify randomize covariates identified researchers attempt reduce biases observational studies complicated statistical methods propensity score matching methods require large populations subjects extensive information covariates outcomes also quantified possible bone density amount cell substance blood physical strength endurance based subjects professional observers opinion design observational study render results objective therefore convincing
ethicsedit
main article research ethics
placing distribution independent variables control researcher experiment particularly involves human subjects introduces potential ethical considerations balancing benefit harm fairly distributing interventions treatments disease informed consent example psychology health care unethical provide substandard treatment patients therefore ethical review boards supposed stop clinical trials experiments unless treatment believed offer benefits good current best practice16 also generally unethical often illegal conduct randomized experiments effects substandard harmful treatments effects ingesting arsenic human health understand effects exposures scientists sometimes observational studies understand effects factors
even experimental research directly involve human subjects still present ethical concerns example nuclear bomb experiments conducted manhattan project implied nuclear reactions harm human beings even though experiments directly involve human subjects
