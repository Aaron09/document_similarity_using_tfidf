historyedit
main article history measurement
french revolution gave rise metric system spread around world replacing customary units measure systems length distance mass time base quantities
later science developments showed either electric charge electric current could added extend base quantities many metrological units could easily defined however electrical units necessary gaussian units example length mass time base quantities ampere defined terms units quantities power speed derived base example speed distance unit time historically wide range units used type quantity different contexts length measured inches feet yards fathoms rods chains furlongs miles nautical miles stadia leagues conversion factors powers arrangements satisfactory contexts
preference universal consistent system based rational base units gradually spread growth science changing measurement system substantial financial cultural costs must offset advantages obtained using rational system however pressure built including scientists engineers conversion rational also internationally consistent basis measurement
antiquity systems measurement defined locally different units might defined independently according length kings thumb size foot length stride length maybe weight water specific size perhaps defined hands knuckles unifying characteristic definition based standard eventually cubits strides gave customary units meet needs merchants scientists
metric system recent systems single basic unit used base quantity often secondary units multiples submultiples derived basic units multiplying powers simply moving decimal point thus basic metric unit length metre distance 1234 1234 millimetres 0001234 kilometres

metric systems units evolved since adoption first welldefined system france 1795 evolution systems spread throughout world first nonenglishspeaking countries english speaking countries
multiples submultiples metric units related powers names formed prefixes relationship compatible decimal system numbers contributes greatly convenience metric units
early metric system base units metre length gram mass units length mass units area volume derived units density derived base units
mesures usuelles french customary measurements system measurement introduced compromise metric system traditional measurements used france 1812 1839
number variations metric system include gravitational systems centimetre–gram–second systems useful science metre–tonne–second system used ussr metre–kilogram–second system
current international standard metric system international system units système international dunités system based metre kilogram second well kelvin ampere candela mole

imperial customary unitsedit
main articles imperial customary measurement systems imperial units customary units
imperial units customary units derive earlier english units imperial units mostly used former british empire british commonwealth countries largely supplanted metric system still used applications united kingdom mostly replaced metric system commercial scientific industrial applications customary units however still main system measurement united states steps towards metrication made mainly late 1960s early 1970s customary units strong hold vast industrial infrastructure commercial development
imperial customary systems closely related number differences units length area inch foot yard mile identical except surveying purposesclarification needed avoirdupois units mass weight differ units larger pound imperial system uses stone long hundredweight long 2240 stone used hundredweights tons short 2000 respectively
systems notably differ units volume fluid ounce millilitres slightly larger imperial fluid ounce however pint imperial pint imperial pint larger true quarts gallons gallons little less five imperial gallons
avoirdupois system served general system mass weight addition troy apothecaries systems troy weight customarily used precious metals black powder gemstones troy ounce unit system current used precious metals although troy ounce larger avoirdupois equivalent pound smaller obsolete troy pound divided ounces rather ounces pound avoirdupois system apothecaries system traditionally used pharmacology replaced metric system shared pound ounce troy system different subdivisions
natural unitsedit
natural units physical units measurement defined terms universal physical constants manner selected physical constants take numerical value expressed terms units natural units named definition relies properties nature human construct various systems natural units possible
examples follows

geometric unit systems useful relativistic physics systems base physical units chosen speed light gravitational constant equal unity
planck units form geometric units obtained also setting boltzmanns constant coulomb force constant reduced planck constant unity based properties free space rather object particle
stoney units similar planck units elementary charge unity allow plancks constant float number determined experiment
schrödinger units also similar planck units also elementary charge unity allow speed light float
atomic units system units used atomic physics particularly describing properties electrons atomic units chosen several constants relating electron equal similar schrödinger units electron mass unity allow gravitational constant float unit energy system total energy electron bohr atom called hartree energy unit length bohr radius
electronic units similar stoney units electron mass unity allow gravitational constant float also similar atomic units speed light unity allow plancks constant float
quantum electrodynamical units similar electronic system units except proton mass normalised rather electron mass

nonstandard unitsedit
nonstandard measurement units sometimes found books newspapers include
areaedit

american football field playing area yards long feet wide often used american public media sizes large buildings parks used unit length length playing field excluding goal areas unit area 57600 5350 acres
british media also frequently uses football pitch equivalent purposes although soccer pitches fixed size instead vary within defined limits 100–130 914–1189 long 50–100 457–914 wide giving area 5000 13000 4181 10870 however uefa champions league field must exactly 11483 7437 giving area 7140 0714 8539 1764 acres example vessels aluminium catamarans size football pitch belfast telegraph june 2007
larger areas sometimes expressed multiple areas certain american states subdivisions

energyedit

equivalent multiples kiloton megaton gigaton often used stating power energetic events explosions volcanic events earthquakes asteroid impacts gram unit energy defined 1000 thermochemical calories 1000 4184
atom bomb dropped hiroshima force often used public media popular books unit energy yield roughly kilotons
stick dynamite

units currencyedit
unit measurement applies money called unit account economics unit measure accounting3 normally currency issued country fraction thereof instance dollar cent ​1⁄100 dollar euro euro cent
4217 international standard describing three letter codes also known currency code define names currencies established international organization standardization
