gunpowder invented 9thcentury china spread throughout parts eurasia 13th century3 originally developed alchemists medicinal purposes gunpowder first used warfare 1000
gunpowder classified explosive relatively slow decomposition rate consequently brisance explosives deflagrate burn subsonic speeds whereas high explosives detonate producing supersonic wave
ignition gunpowder packed behind projectile generates enough pressure force shot muzzle high speed usually enough force rupture barrel gunpowder thus makes good propellant less suitable shattering rock fortifications lowyield explosive power however transferring enough energy burning gunpowder mass cannonball cannonball opposing fortifications impacting ammunition eventually bombardier wear opponents fortified defenses
gunpowder widely used fill fused artillery shells used mining civil engineering projects second half 19th century first high explosives gunpowder longer used modern weapons used industrial purposes relatively inefficient cost compared newer alternatives dynamite ammonium nitratefuel oil56 today gunpowder firearms limited primarily hunting target shooting bulletless historical reenactments
