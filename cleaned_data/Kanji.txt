earliest japanese documents probably written bilingual chinese korean officials employed yamato court5 example diplomatic correspondence king emperor shun song praised skillful allusion later groups people called fuhito organized monarch read write classical chinese reign empress suiko 593–628 yamato court began sending fullscale diplomatic missions china resulted large increase chinese literacy japanese court6
japanese language written form time chinese characters introduced texts written read chinese later heian period 794–1185 however system known kanbun emerged involved using chinese text diacritical marks allow japanese speakers restructure read chinese sentences changing word order adding particles verb endings accordance rules japanese grammar

often character used sound meaning simply matter choosing correct reading based word represents cases character used sound ateji case pronunciation still based standard reading used meaning broadly form ateji narrowly jukujikun therefore full compound—not individual character—has reading also special cases reading completely different often based historical traditional reading
analogous phenomenon occurs much lesser degree chinese varieties literary colloquial readings chinese characters borrowed readings native readings chinese borrowed readings native readings etymologically related since chinese varieties related chinese japanese related thus form doublets generally similar analogous different onyomi reflecting different stages chinese borrowings japanese

chinese characters associated single chinese sound though distinct literary colloquial readings however homographs pinyin duōyīnzì háng xíng japanese reading chinese representing different meanings reflected carryover japanese well additionally many chinese syllables especially entering tone largely consonantvowel phonotactics classical japanese thus onyomi composed morae beats second either lengthening vowel first mora vowel syllables historically later merged moraic chosen approximation final consonants middle chinese palatalized consonants vowels developed japanese result chinese borrowings virtually unknown words native japanese origin common chinese

kunyomi characterized strict syllable structure yamato kotoba noun adjective kunyomi three syllables long verb kunyomi usually three syllables length counting trailing hiragana called okurigana okurigana considered part internal reading character although part reading word beginner language rarely come across characters long readings readings three even four syllables uncommon contrasts onyomi monosyllabic unusual chinese family scripts generally character syllable chinese also korean vietnamese zhuang polysyllabic chinese characters rare considered nonstandard
uketamawaru kokorozashi mikotonori five syllables represented single kanji longest readings jōyō character unusually long readings single character representing compound word

mixed readings edit




jūbako mixed onkun reading






yutō mixed kunon reading


many kanji compounds mixture onyomi kunyomi known jūbako multilayered food yutō liquid pail words depending order examples kind compound autological words first character jūbako read using onyomi second kunyomi onkun around yutō kunon
formally referred jūbakoyomi 重箱読み jūbako reading yutōyomi 湯桶読み yutō reading note words onyomi long vowel long vowels japanese generally come chinese hence distinctive onyomi japanese form hybrid words examples include basho place kunon kiniro golden onkun aikidō martial aikido kunonon
ateji often mixed readings instance city sapporo whose name derives ainu language meaning japanese written onkun compound includes sokuon purely compound
special readingsedit
gikun jukujikun readings kanji combinations direct correspondence characters individual onyomi kunyomi point view character rather word known nankun difficult reading listed kanji dictionaries entry character
gikun nonstandard kanji used generally effect using reading fuyu winter rather standard character
jukujikun standard kanji word related meaning sound word pronounced whole corresponding sounds individual kanji example morning jukujikun read neither imaasa kunyomi characters konchō onyomi characters combination thereof instead read kesa native bisyllabic japanese word seen single morpheme fusion previously kefu today morning likewise tomorrow jukujikun read neither akarinohi kunyomi characters meinichi onyomi characters combination thereof instead read ashita native multisyllabic japanese word seen single morpheme
jukujikun primarily used native japanese words yamato name japanese province well ancient name japan borrowings shishamo willow leaf fish ainu tabako smoke grass portuguese bīru wheat alcohol dutch especially word borrowed meiji period words whose kanji jukujikun often usually written hiragana native katakana borrowed borrowed words also written hiragana especially portuguese loanwords karuta portuguese carta card tempura てんぷら portuguese tempora time spanish bread well tabako
sometimes jukujikun even kanji syllables examples kera woodpecker gumi silver berryoleaster20 hozumi 八月朔日 surname21
jukujikun quite varied often kanji compound jukujikun idiosyncratic created word corresponding chinese word existing cases kanji compound existing chinese word reused chinese word onyomi used japanese example reindeer jukujikun tonakai ainu onyomi reading junroku also used cases japanese coinages subsequently borrowed back chinese ankō monkfish
underlying word jukujikun native japanese word foreign borrowing either existing kanji spelling either kunyomi ateji kanji spelling produced often word noun simple noun compound derived verb verb form fusional pronunciation example sumō sumo originally verb sumau today fusional rare cases jukujikun also applied inflectional words verbs adjectives case frequently corresponding chinese word
examples jukujikun inflectional words follow common example jukujikun adjective kawaii cute originally kawayui word used chinese corresponding onyomi used japanese contrast appropriate either fusawashii 相応しい jukujikun onyomi used shii ending formerly different class adjectives common example verb jukujikun hayaru spread vogue corresponding onyomi ryūkō sample jukujikun deverbal noun derived verb form yusuri extortion yusuru extort spelling kyōsei extortion many examples note also compound verbs less commonly compound adjectives multiple kanji without intervening characters read using usual kunyomi examples include omoshiroi interesting facewhitening zurugashikoi
typographically furigana jukujikun often written centered across entire word inflectional words entire root corresponding reading related entire word rather part word centered corresponding character often done usual phonosemantic readings
broadly speaking jukujikun considered form ateji though narrow usage ateji refers specifically using characters sound meaning soundspelling rather meaning sound meaningspelling jukujikun
many jukujikun established meaningspellings began life gikun improvised meaningspellings occasionally single word many kanji spellings extreme example hototogisu lesser cuckoo spelt great many ways including 杜宇田鵑 many variant spellings particular haiku poems
single character gairaigoedit
rare cases individual kanji reading borrowed modern foreign language gairaigo though often words written katakana notable examples include pēji 頁、ページ page botan 釦／鈕、ボタン button zero 零、ゼロ zero mētoru 米、メートル meter list single character gairaigo classed kunyomi single character character used meaning without chinese pronunciation rather ateji classification used gairaigo term written compound characters however unlike vast majority kunyomi readings native japanese rather borrowed kunyomi label misleading readings also written katakana unlike usual hiragana native kunyomi note characters units particularly units many cases using characters kokuji coined meiji period kiromētoru 粁、キロメートル kilometer meter thousand
readingsedit
kanji also lesserknown readings called nanori mostly used names often given names general closely related kunyomi place names sometimes also nanori occasionally unique readings found elsewhere
example surname literally little birds play implies predators hawks present pronounced kotori asobu name also mean 鷹がいない taka inai literally hawks around shortened pronounced takanashi22
readingedit
although general rules onyomi kunyomi language littered exceptions always possible even native speaker know read character without prior knowledge especially true names people places given character multiple kunyomi onyomi reading japanese primarily recognizes words multiple characters okurigana readings rather individual characters guess readings characters trying sound unrecognized word
homographs exist however sometimes deduced context sometimes cannot requiring glossary example read either today informal special fused reading native word konnichi days formal onyomi formal writing generally read konnichi cases multiple readings common pork soup commonly pronounced tonjiru mixed onkun butajiru kunkun somewhat common nationally inconsistencies abound example gyūniku beef yōniku mutton onon readings butaniku pork toriniku poultry kunon readings
main guideline single kanji followed okurigana hiragana characters part word used native verbs adjectives always indicates kunyomi kanji compounds kango usually onyomi usually kanon however onyomi also common kunyomi also commonly used kango kanji isolation without okurigana typically read using kunyomi though numerous exceptions example iron usually read onyomi tetsu rather kunyomi kurogane chinese onyomi common kanon reading frequent cause difficulty mistakes encountering unfamiliar words inexperienced readers though skilled natives recognize word good example gedoku detoxification antipoison goon usually instead read
okurigana used kunyomi mark inflected ending native verb adjective convention note japanese verbs adjectives closed class generally admit words borrowed chinese vocabulary nouns form verbs adding suru adjectives cannot become native japanese vocabulary inflect example akai atarashii miru okurigana used indicate kunyomi taberu versus casual meaning always sufficient read hiraku meaning open particularly complicated example multiple onyomi okurigana details okurigana also used nouns adverbs nasake sympathy kanarazu invariably kane money instance okurigana important aspect kanji usage japanese article information kunyomi orthography
kanji occurring compounds multikanji words jukugo generally read using onyomi especially fourcharacter compounds yojijukugo though exceptions abound example jōhō information gakkō school shinkansen bullet train follow pattern isolated kanji versus compound distinction gives words similar concepts completely different pronunciations north east kunyomi kita higashi standalone characters northeast compound uses onyomi hokutō complicated fact many kanji onyomi read sensei teacher isshō ones whole life meaning also important indicator reading read means simple means divination onyomi character
rules thumb many exceptions kunyomi compound words numerous onyomi neither rare examples include tegami letter higasa parasol famous kamikaze divine wind compounds also okurigana also written karaage chinesestyle fried chicken origami although many also written okurigana omitted example
similarly onyomi characters also used words isolation love mark cases involve kanji kunyomi confusion although exceptions occur alone read gold kane money metal context determine writers intended reading meaning
multiple readings given rise number homographs cases different meanings depending read example read three different ways jōzu skilled uwate upper part kamite stage lefthouse right addition reading umai skilled subtly three different readings meaning tomorrow ashita casual polite myōnichi formal furigana reading glosses often used clarify potential ambiguities
conversely cases homophonous terms distinguished writing different characters distinguished speech hence potentially confusing cases important distinguish speech reading relevant character changed example privately established school city established normally pronounced shiritsu speech distinguished alternative pronunciations watakushiritsu ichiritsu informally legal jargon preamble full text pronounced zenbun pronounced maebun clarity memorized preamble whole text constitution examples primarily using kunyomi character normally onyomi term
stated jūbako yutō readings also uncommon indeed four combinations reading possible onon kunkun kunon onkun
several famous place names including japan nihon sometimes nippon cities tokyo tōkyō kyoto kyōto main islands honshu honshū kyushu kyūshū shikoku shikoku hokkaido hokkaidō read onyomi however majority japanese place names read kunyomi ōsaka aomori hakone names often characters readings common outside names characters used abbreviations place names reading match original osaka kobe baseball team hanshin tigers take name onyomi second kanji ōsaka first kōbe name keisei railway line linking tokyo narita formed similarly although reading despite already onyomi word tōkyō
japanese family names also usually read kunyomi yamada tanaka suzuki japanese given names often irregular readings although typically considered jūbako yutō often contain mixtures kunyomi onyomi nanori daisuke onkun natsumi kunon chosen discretion parents readings given names follow rules impossible know certainty read persons name without independent verification parents quite creative rumours abound children called earth enjeru angel neither common names normal readings chikyū tenshi respectively common japanese names written multiple ways akira written many characters kanji combinations listed23 satoshi written etc24 haruka written several possibilities25 common patterns exist however allowing experienced readers make good guess names alleviate confusion pronounce names japanese people official japanese documents require japanese write names kana kanji26
chinese place names chinese personal names appearing japanese texts spelled kanji almost invariably read onyomi especially older wellknown names resulting japanese pronunciation differ widely used modern chinese speakers example zedongs name pronounced takutō japanese name legendary monkey king wukong pronounced gokū japanese
today chinese names well known japan often spelled katakana instead form much closely approximating native chinese pronunciation alternatively written kanji katakana furigana many cities names come nonchinese languages like mongolian manchu examples notwellknown chinese names include
