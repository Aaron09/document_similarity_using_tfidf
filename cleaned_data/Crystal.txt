main article crystal structure
scientific definition crystal based microscopic arrangement atoms inside called crystal structure crystal solid atoms form periodic arrangement quasicrystals exception
solids crystals example liquid water starts freezing phase change begins small crystals grow fuse forming polycrystalline structure final block small crystals called crystallites grains true crystal periodic arrangement atoms whole polycrystal periodic arrangement atoms periodic pattern broken grain boundaries macroscopic inorganic solids polycrystalline including almost metals ceramics rocks solids neither crystalline polycrystalline glass called amorphous solids also called glassy vitreous noncrystalline periodic order even microscopically distinct differences crystalline solids amorphous solids notably process forming glass release latent heat fusion forming crystal
crystal structure arrangement atoms crystal characterized unit cell small imaginary containing atoms specific spatial arrangement unit cells stacked threedimensional space form crystal
symmetry crystal constrained requirement unit cells stack perfectly gaps possible crystal symmetries called crystallographic space groups grouped crystal systems cubic crystal system crystals form cubes rectangular boxes halite shown right hexagonal crystal system crystals form hexagons ordinary water
crystal faces shapes




halite crystal growing atoms easily attach parts surface rough atomicscale structure many dangling bonds therefore parts crystal grow quickly yellow arrows eventually whole surface consists smooth stable faces atoms cannot easily attach


crystals commonly recognized shape consisting flat faces sharp angles shape characteristics necessary crystal—a crystal scientifically defined microscopic atomic arrangement macroscopic shape—but characteristic macroscopic shape often present easy
euhedral crystals obvious wellformed flat faces anhedral crystals usually crystal grain polycrystalline solid
flat faces also called facets euhedral crystal oriented specific relative underlying atomic arrangement crystal planes relatively miller index9 occurs surface orientations stable others lower surface energy crystal grows atoms attach easily rougher less stable parts surface less easily flat stable surfaces therefore flat surfaces tend grow larger smoother whole crystal surface consists plane surfaces diagram right
oldest techniques science crystallography consists measuring threedimensional orientations faces crystal using infer underlying crystal symmetry
crystals habit visible external shape determined crystal structure restricts possible facet orientations specific crystal chemistry bonding favor facet types others conditions crystal formed

fossil shell calcite crystals


rocks
volume weight largest concentrations crystals earth part solid bedrock crystals found rocks typically range size fraction millimetre several centimetres across although exceptionally large crystals occasionally found 1999update worlds largest known naturally occurring crystal crystal beryl malakialina madagascar long diameter weighing 380000 840000 lb10
crystals formed magmatic metamorphic processes giving origin large masses crystalline rock vast majority igneous rocks formed molten magma degree crystallization depends primarily conditions solidified rocks granite cooled slowly great pressures completely crystallized many kinds lava poured surface cooled rapidly latter group small amount amorphous glassy matter common crystalline rocks metamorphic rocks marbles micaschists quartzites recrystallized means first fragmental rocks like limestone shale sandstone never molten condition entirely solution high temperature pressure conditions metamorphism acted erasing original structures inducing recrystallization solid state11
rock crystals formed precipitation fluids commonly water form druses quartz veins evaporites halite gypsum limestones deposited aqueous solution mostly owing evaporation arid climates

waterbased form snow glaciers common manifestation crystalline polycrystalline matter earthcitation needed single snowflake single crystal collection crystals12 cube polycrystal
organigenic crystals
many living organisms able produce crystals example calcite aragonite case molluscs hydroxylapatite case vertebrates
polymorphism allotropy
main articles polymorphism materials science allotropy
group atoms often solidify many different ways polymorphism ability solid exist crystal form example water ordinarily found hexagonal form also exist cubic rhombohedral many forms different polymorphs usually called different phases
addition atoms able form noncrystalline phases example water also form amorphous sio2 form fused silica amorphous glass quartz crystal likewise substance form crystals also form polycrystals
pure chemical elements polymorphism known allotropy example diamond graphite crystalline forms carbon amorphous carbon noncrystalline form polymorphs despite atoms wildly different properties example diamond among hardest substances known graphite soft used lubricant
polyamorphism similar phenomenon atoms exist amorphous solid form

twinned pyrite crystal group


semiconductors special type impurity called dopant drastically changes crystals electrical properties semiconductor devices transistors made possible largely putting different semiconductor dopants different places specific patterns
twinning phenomenon somewhere crystallographic defect grain boundary like grain boundary twin boundary different crystal orientations sides unlike grain boundary orientations random related specific mirrorimage
mosaicity spread crystal plane orientations mosaic crystal supposed consist smaller crystalline units somewhat misaligned respect
chemical bonds
general solids held together various types chemical bonds metallic bonds ionic bonds covalent bonds waals bonds others none necessarily crystalline noncrystalline however general trends follows

special properties anisotropy
also crystal optics
