morse code famous type code


communications information processing code system rules convert information—such letter word sound image gesture—into another form representation sometimes shortened secret communication channel storage medium early example invention language enabled person speech communicate heard felt thought others speech limits range communication distance voice carry limits audience present speech uttered invention writing converted spoken language visual symbols extended range communication across space time
process encoding converts information source symbols communication storage decoding reverse process converting code symbols back form recipient understands
reason coding enable communication places ordinary plain language spoken written difficult impossible example semaphore configuration flags held signaler arms semaphore tower encodes parts message typically individual letters numbers another person standing great distance away interpret flags reproduce words sent

variablelength codesedit
main article variablelength code
codes encode source clear text character code word dictionary concatenation code words give encoded string variablelength codes especially useful clear text characters different probabilities also entropy encoding
prefix code code prefix property valid code word system prefix start valid code word huffman coding known algorithm deriving prefix codes prefix codes widely referred huffman codes even code produced huffman algorithm examples prefix codes country calling codes country publisher parts isbns secondary synchronization codes used umts wcdma wireless standard
krafts inequality characterizes sets codeword lengths possible prefix code virtually uniquely decodable onetomany code necessary prefix must satisfy krafts inequality
errorcorrecting codesedit
main article error detection correction
also block code
codes also used represent data resistant errors transmission storage socalled errorcorrecting code works including carefully crafted redundancy stored transmitted data examples include hamming codes reed–solomon reed–muller walsh–hadamard bose–chaudhuri–hochquenghem turbo golay goppa lowdensity paritycheck codes space–time codes error detecting codes optimised detect burst errors random errors

codes communication used brevityedit
cable code replaces words ship invoice shorter words allowing information sent fewer characters quickly less expensively
codes used brevity telegraph messages state rapid long distance communication elaborate systems commercial codes encoded complete phrases single mouths commonly fiveminute groups developed telegraphers became conversant words byoxo trying weasel deal liouy answer question bmuld youre skunk ayylu clearly coded repeat clearly code words chosen various reasons length pronounceability meanings chosen perceived needs commercial negotiations military terms military codes diplomatic terms diplomatic codes preceding espionage codes codebooks codebook publishers proliferated including front american black chamber herbert yardley first second world wars purpose codes save cable costs data coding data compression predates computer early example telegraph morse code morefrequently used characters shorter representations techniques huffman coding used computerbased algorithms compress large data files compact form storage transmission
character encodingsedit
main article character encoding
probably widely known data communication code character representation today ascii another somewhat compatible version used nearly personal computers terminals printers communication equipment represents characters sevenbit binary numbers—that string seven bits ascii lowercase always 1100001 uppercase always 1000001 many encodings represent character byte usually referred code pages integer code point unicode byte sequence utf8
genetic codeedit
main article genetic code
biological organisms contain genetic material used control function development contains units named genes messenger derived turn produces proteins genetic code series triplets codons four possible nucleotides translated twenty possible amino acids sequence codons results corresponding sequence amino acids form protein molecule type codon called stop codon signals sequence
gödel codeedit
mathematics gödel code basis proof gödels incompleteness theorem idea mathematical notation natural number using gödel numbering
otheredit
codes using colors like traffic lights color code employed mark nominal value electrical resistors trashcans devoted specific types garbage paper glass organic
marketing coupon codes used financial discount rebate purchasing product usually internet retailer
military environments specific sounds cornet used different uses mark moments command infantry battlefield

cryptographyedit
history cryptography codes common ensuring confidentiality communications although ciphers used instead
secret codes intended obscure real messages ranging serious mainly espionage military diplomacy business trivial romance games kind imaginative encoding flowers game cards clothes fans hats melodies birds sole requisite preagreement meaning sender receiver
examplesedit
examples encoding include

encoding cognition basic perceptual process interpreting incoming stimuli technically speaking complex multistage process converting relatively objective sensory input light sound subjectively meaningful experience
content format specific encoding format converting specific type data information
text encoding uses markup language structure features text facilitate processing computers also text encoding initiative
semantics encoding formal language formal language method representing terms programs descriptions language using language
electronic encoding transforms signal code optimized transmission storage generally done codec
neural encoding information represented neurons
