usageedit
late 20th century exonyms often became controversial groups often prefer outsiders avoid exonyms come used pejorative example romani people often prefer term exonyms gypsy egypt french term bohémien bohème bohemia people also avoid exonyms reasons historical sensitivity case german names polish czech places time ethnically politically german danziggdańsk karlsbadkarlovy vary russian names locations russian control kievkyiv
recent years geographers sought reduce exonyms avoid kind problem example common spanish speakers refer turkish capital ankara rather spanish exonym angora according united nations statistics division time however shown initial ambitious attempts rapidly decrease number exonyms overoptimistic possible realise intended reason would appear many exonyms become common words language seen part language’s cultural heritage
situations exonyms preferred instance multilingual cities brussels known linguistic tensions dutch frenchspeakers neutral name preferred offend anyone thus exonym brussels english could used instead favoring either local names brussel dutchflemish bruxelles french
difficulties endonyms pronunciation spelling word category endonym include sounds spellings highly unfamiliar speakers languages making appropriate usage difficult impossible outsider years endonym undergone phonetic changes either original language borrowing language thus changing endonym exonym case paris formerly pronounced french another example endonym german city cologne latin original colonia evolved köln german italian spanish exonym colonia closely reflects latin original cases standardized spelling available either language unwritten even unanalyzed competing nonstandard spellings misspelled endonym perhaps problematic respectful existing exonym finally endonym plural noun naturally extend adjectival usage another language like english propensity adjectives describing culture language attempt endonym thus bizarresounding result

exonyms pejorativesedit
matisoff wrote groups autonym often egocentric equating name people mankind general name language human speech6 example various native american autonyms sometimes explained english readers literal translations original people normal people implicit contrast first nations original normal exonyms often describe others foreignspeaking nonspeaking nonsensespeaking classic example slavic term germans nemtsi possibly deriving plural nemy mute standard etymology slavic peoples referred germanic neighbors mutes language unintelligible term survives russian nemtsy немцы bulgarian nemtsi немци ukrainian nimtsi німці polish niemcy czech němci slovak slovenian serbocroatian nijemcinemci нијемцинемци montenegrin njemci њемци well hungarian német romanian nemţi adopted slavic even turkish nemçe arabic alnimsa النمسا turkish adapted slavic arabic turkish words cases referring specifically austria
prominent theories regarding origin term slav suggests comes slavic root slovo hence slovenia slovakia meaning word speech context slavs describing germanic people mutes—in contrast speaking ones
