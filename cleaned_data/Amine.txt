classification aminesedit
aliphatic amine aromatic ring attached directly nitrogen atom aromatic amines nitrogen atom connected aromatic ring various anilines aromatic ring decreases alkalinity amine depending substituents presence amine group strongly increases reactivity aromatic ring electrondonating effect
amines organized four subcategories

primary amines—primary amines arise three hydrogen atoms ammonia replaced alkyl aromatic important primary alkyl amines include methylamine amino acids buffering agent tris primary aromatic amines include aniline
secondary amines—secondary amines organic substituents alkyl aryl bound nitrogen together hydrogen important representatives include dimethylamine example aromatic amine would diphenylamine
tertiary amines—in tertiary amines nitrogen three organic substituents examples include trimethylamine distinctively fishy smell edta
cyclic amines—cyclic amines either secondary tertiary amines examples cyclic amines include 3membered ring aziridine sixmembered ring piperidine nmethylpiperidine nphenylpiperidine examples cyclic tertiary amines

also possible four organic substituents nitrogen species amines quaternary ammonium cations charged nitrogen center quaternary ammonium salts exist many kinds anions
naming conventionsedit
amines named several ways typically compound given prefix amino suffix amine prefix shows substitution nitrogen atom organic compound multiple amino groups called diamine triamine tetraamine forth
systematic names common amines


lower amines named suffix amine

methylamine

higher amines prefix amino functional group iupac however recommend conventioncitation needed prefers alkanamine form pentan2amine

2aminopentane
sometimes pent2ylamine pentan2amine



physical propertiesedit
hydrogen bonding significantly influences properties primary secondary amines6 thus melting point boiling point amines higher corresponding phosphines generally lower corresponding alcohols carboxylic acids example methyl ethyl amines gases standard conditions whereas corresponding methyl ethyl alcohols liquids amines possess characteristic ammonia smell liquid amines distinctive fishy smell
nitrogen atom features lone electron pair bind form ammonium r3nh lone electron pair represented article dots next water solubility simple amines enhanced hydrogen bonding involving lone electron pairs typically salts ammonium compounds exhibit following order solubility water primary ammonium
secondary ammonium

tertiary ammonium r3nh small aliphatic amines display significant solubility many solvents whereas large substituents lipophilic aromatic amines aniline lone pair electrons conjugated benzene ring thus tendency engage hydrogen bonding diminished boiling points high solubility water
structureedit
alkyl aminesedit
alkyl amines characteristically feature tetrahedral nitrogen centers angles approach idealized angle 109° distances slightly shorter distances energy barrier nitrogen inversion stereocenter kcalmol trialkylamine interconversion compared inversion open umbrella strong wind
amines type nhrr′ nrr′r″ chiral nitrogen center bears four substituents counting lone pair barrier inversion amines type nhrr′ cannot obtained optical purity chiral tertiary amines nrr′r″ resolved groups constrained cyclic structures nsubstituted aziridines quaternary ammonium salts resolvable







inversion amine pair dots represents lone electron pair nitrogen atom


aromatic aminesedit
aromatic amines anilines nitrogen often nearly planar owing conjugation lone pair aryl substituent distance correspondingly shorter aniline distance distances7

basicity amines depends

electronic properties substituents alkyl groups enhance basicity aryl groups diminish
degree solvation protonated amine includes steric hindrance groups nitrogen

electronic effectsedit
owing inductive effects basicity amine might expected increase number alkyl groups amine correlations complicated owing effects solvation opposite trends inductive effects solvation effects also dominate basicity aromatic amines anilines anilines lone pair electrons nitrogen delocalises ring resulting decreased basicity substituents aromatic ring positions relative amine group also affect basicity seen table
solvation effectsedit
solvation significantly affects basicity amines groups strongly interact water especially ammonium ions consequently basicity ammonia enhanced 1011 solvation intrinsic basicity amines situation solvation unimportant evaluated phase phase amines exhibit basicities predicted electronreleasing effects organic substituents thus tertiary amines basic secondary amines basic primary amines finally ammonia least basic order pkbs basicities water follow order similarly aniline basic ammonia phase thousand times less aqueous solution11
aprotic polar solvents dmso acetonitrile energy solvation high protic polar solvents like water methanol reason basicity amines aprotic solvents almost solely governed electronic factors
synthesisedit
alkylationedit
industrially significant amines prepared ammonia alkylation alcohols5

r′nh2 rr′nh rr′nh2x

reactions useful alkyl iodides bromides rarely employed degree alkylation difficult control5 selectivity improved delépine reaction although rarely employed industrial scale
reductive routesedit
process hydrogenation nitriles reduced amines using hydrogen presence nickel catalyst reactions sensitive acidic alkaline conditions cause hydrolysis group lialh4 commonly employed reduction nitriles laboratory scale similarly lialh4 reduces amides amines many amines produced aldehydes ketones reductive amination either proceed catalytically stoichiometrically
aniline c6h5nh2 derivatives prepared reduction nitroaromatics industry hydrogen preferred reductant whereas laboratory iron often employed
specialized methodsedit
many laboratory methods exist preparation amines many methods rather specialized
