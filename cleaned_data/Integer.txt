algebraic propertiesedit




integers thought discrete equally spaced points infinitely long number line nonnegative integers shown purple negative integers


like natural numbers closed operations addition multiplication product integers integer however inclusion negative natural numbers importantly unlike natural numbers also closed subtraction integers form unital ring basic following sense unital ring unique ring homomorphism integers ring universal property namely initial object category rings characterizes ring
closed division since quotient integers divided need integer although natural numbers closed exponentiation integers since result fraction exponent negative
following lists basic properties addition multiplication integers

language abstract algebra first five properties listed addition addition abelian group group addition cyclic group since every nonzero integer written finite fact addition infinite cyclic group sense infinite cyclic group isomorphic
first four properties listed multiplication multiplication commutative monoid however every integer multiplicative inverse integer left hand side even right hand side means multiplication group
rules property table except last taken together together addition multiplication commutative ring unity prototype objects algebraic structure equalities expressions true values variables true unital commutative ring note certain nonzero integers zero certain rings
lack zero divisors integers last property table means commutative ring integral domain
lack multiplicative inverses equivalent fact closed division means field smallest field containing integers subring field rational numbers process constructing rationals integers mimicked form field fractions integral domain back starting algebraic number field extension rational numbers ring integers extracted includes subring
moreover principal ideal8
although ordinary division defined division remainder defined called euclidean division possesses following important property given integers exist unique integers denotes absolute value integer called quotient called remainder division euclidean algorithm computing greatest common divisors works sequence euclidean divisions
language abstract algebra says euclidean domain implies principal ideal domain positive integer written products primes essentially unique fundamental theorem arithmetic
ordertheoretic propertiesedit
totally ordered without upper lower bound ordering given integer positive greater zero negative less zero zero defined neither negative positive
ordering integers compatible algebraic operations following




follows together ordering ordered ring
integers nontrivial totally ordered abelian group whose positive elements wellordered9 equivalent statement noetherian valuation ring either field discrete valuation ring
constructionedit




points represent ordered pairs natural numbers linked points equivalence classes representing blue integers line


elementary school teaching integers often intuitively defined positive natural numbers zero negations natural numbers however style definition leads many different cases arithmetic operation needs defined combination types integer makes tedious prove operations obey laws arithmetic10 therefore modern settheoretic mathematics abstract construction11 allows define arithmetical operations without case distinction often used instead12 integers thus formally constructed equivalence classes ordered pairs natural numbers ab13
