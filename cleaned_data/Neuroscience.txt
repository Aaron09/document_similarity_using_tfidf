20th century neuroscience began recognized distinct academic discipline right rather studies nervous system within disciplines eric kandel collaborators cited david rioch francis schmitt stephen kuffler played critical roles establishing field24 rioch originated integration basic anatomical physiological research clinical psychiatry walter reed army institute research starting 1950s period schmitt established neuroscience research program within biology department massachusetts institute technology bringing together biology chemistry physics mathematics first freestanding neuroscience department called psychobiology founded 1964 university california irvine james mcgaughcitation needed followed department neurobiology harvard medical school founded 1966 stephen kuffler25
understanding neurons nervous system function became increasingly precise molecular 20th century example 1952 alan lloyd hodgkin andrew huxley presented mathematical model transmission electrical signals neurons giant axon squid called action potentials initiated propagated known hodgkin–huxley model 1961–1962 richard fitzhugh nagumo simplified hodgkin–huxley called fitzhugh–nagumo model 1962 bernard katz modeled neurotransmission across space neurons known synapses beginning 1966 eric kandel collaborators examined biochemical changes neurons associated learning memory storage aplysia 1981 catherine morris harold lecar combined models morris–lecar model increasingly quantitative work gave rise numerous biological neuron models
