third argument incompatibilism formulated carl ginet 1960s received much attention modern literature simplified argument runs along lines determinism true control events past determined present state control laws nature since control matters also control consequences since present choices acts determinism necessary consequences past laws nature control hence free called consequence argument3839 peter inwagen remarks broad version consequence argument early 1930s40
difficulty argument compatibilists lies fact entails impossibility could chosen example jane compatibilist sofa committed claim could remained standing desired follows consequence argument jane remained standing would either generated contradiction violated laws nature changed past hence compatibilists committed existence incredible abilities according ginet inwagen response argument equivocates notions abilities necessities free evoked make given choice really illusion choice made along oblivious decider39 david lewis suggests compatibilists committed ability something otherwise different circumstances actually obtained past41

first event immediately precedes second event
first event consistent caused second event

example person hears explosion sees tree fall person likely infer explosion caused tree fall however explosion occurs tree falls first requirement rather explosion person hears ring telephone second requirement person likely infer either noise caused tree fall
wegner applied principle inferences people make conscious people typically experience thought consistent behavior observe performing behavior result people infer thoughts must caused observed behavior however wegner able manipulate peoples thoughts behaviors conform violate requirements causal inference187188 work wegner able show people often experience conscious behaviors fact caused conversely people experience lack behaviors cause instance priming subjects information effect increases probability person falsely believes cause189 implication work perception conscious says might accurately labelled emotion authorship tethered execution actual behaviors inferred various cues intricate mental process authorship processing although many interpret work blow argument free psychologists190191 philosophers192193 criticized wegners theories

baumeister colleagues found provoking disbelief free seems cause various negative effects authors concluded paper belief determinism causes negative effects206 justified conclusion however213 first free least refer either libertarian indeterministic free compatibilistic deterministic free participants read articles simply disprove free unlikely increase understanding determinism compatibilistic free still permits213
words provoking disbelief free probably causes belief fatalism discussed earlier article compatibilistic free illustrated statements like choices causes effect affect future whereas fatalism like choices causes effect powerless fatalism threatens peoples sense selfefficacy people confuse fatalism determinism even professional philosophers occasionally confuse thus likely negative consequences accounted participants developing belief fatalism experiments attack belief free will213 test effects belief determinism future studies would need provide articles simply attack free instead focus explaining determinism compatibilism studies conducted indicating people react strongly mental determinism described reconciling moral responsibility eddy nahmias noted peoples actions framed respect beliefs desires rather neurological underpinnings likely dissociate determinism moral responsibility214
various social behavioural traits correlated belief deterministic models mind involved experimental subjection individuals libertarian deterministic perspectives
researchers provoked volunteers disbelieve free participants lied cheated stole kathleen vohs found whose belief free eroded likely cheat215 study conducted baumeister participants read article arguing free likely performance test would rewarded cash216 provoking rejection free also associated increased aggression less helpful behaviour217218 well mindless conformity219 disbelief free even cause people feel less guilt transgressions others220
baumeister colleagues also note volunteers disbelieving free less capable counterfactual thinking206221 worrying counterfactual thinking done something different important part learning ones choices including harmed others222 cannot taken mean belief determinism blame results would expect increasing peoples belief fatalism213
