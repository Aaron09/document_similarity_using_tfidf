historyedit
first known fuel combustion wood sticks homo erectus nearly million years ago2page needed throughout human history fuels derived plants animal used humans charcoal wood derivative used since least 6000 melting metals supplanted coke derived coal european forests started become depleted around 18th century charcoal briquettes commonly used fuel barbecue cooking3
coal first used fuel around 1000 china energy form chemical energy could released combustion4 concept development steam engine united kingdom 1769 coal came common power source coal later used drive ships locomotives 19th century extracted coal used street lighting london 20th 21st centuries primary coal generate electricity providing worlds electrical power supply 20055
fossil fuels rapidly adopted industrial revolution concentrated flexible traditional energy sources water power become pivotal part contemporary society countries world burning fossil fuels order produce power
currently trend towards renewable fuels biofuels like alcohols
