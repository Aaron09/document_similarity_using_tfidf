methodsedit
recently methods used evaluate human factors ergonomics ranged simple questionnaires complex expensive usability labs19 common methods listed

ethnographic analysis using methods derived ethnography process focuses observing uses technology practical environment qualitative observational method focuses realworld experience pressures usage technology environments workplace process best used early design process20
focus groups another form qualitative research individual facilitate discussion elicit opinions technology process investigation onetoone interview basis group session used gain large quantity deep qualitative data21 though small sample size subject higher degree individual bias22 used point design process largely dependent exact questions pursued structure group extremely costly
iterative design also known prototyping iterative design process seeks involve users several stages design correct problems emerge prototypes emerge design process subjected forms analysis outlined article results taken incorporated design trends among users analyzed products redesigned become costly process needs done soon possible design process designs become concrete20
metaanalysis supplementary technique used examine wide body already existing data literature derive trends form hypotheses design decisions part literature survey metaanalysis performed discern collective trend individual variables22
subjectsintandem subjects asked work concurrently series tasks vocalizing analytical observations technique also known codiscovery participants tend feed others comments generate richer observations often possible participants separately observed researcher used discover usability difficulties process usually recordedcitation needed
surveys questionnaires commonly used technique outside human factors well surveys questionnaires advantage administered large group people relatively cost enabling researcher gain large amount data validity data obtained however always question questions must written interpreted correctly definition subjective actually respond effect selfselecting well widening sample population further22
task analysis process roots activity theory task analysis systematically describing human interaction system process understand match demands system process human capabilities complexity process generally proportional complexity task analyzed vary cost time involvement qualitative observational process best used early design process22
think aloud protocol also known concurrent verbal protocol process asking user execute series tasks technology continuously verbalizing thoughts researcher gain insights users analytical process useful finding design flaws affect task performance negative cognitive affect user also useful utilizing experts better understand procedural knowledge task question less expensive focus groups tends specific subjective23
user analysis process based around designing attributes intended user operator establishing characteristics define creating persona user best done outset design process user analysis attempt predict common users characteristics would assumed common problematic design concept match actual user identified vague make clear design decisions process however usually quite inexpensive commonly used22
wizard comparatively uncommon technique seen mobile devices based upon wizard experiment technique involves operator remotely controls operation device imitate response actual computer program advantage producing highly changeable reactions quite costly difficult undertake
methods analysis process studying tasks worker completes using stepbystep investigation task broken smaller steps motion worker performs described enables exactly repetitive straining tasks occur
time studies determine time required worker complete task time studies often used analyze cyclical jobs considered event based studies time measurements triggered occurrence predetermined events24
work sampling method sampled random intervals determine proportion total time spent particular task24 provides insight often workers performing tasks might cause strain bodies

weaknessesedit
problems related measures usability include fact measures learning retention interface rarely employed studies treat measures users interact interfaces synonymous qualityinuse despite unclear relation27
although field methods extremely useful conducted users natural environment major limitations consider limitations include

usually take time resources methods
high effort planning recruiting executing compared methods
much longer study periods therefore requires much goodwill among participants
studies longitudinal nature therefore attrition become problem28
