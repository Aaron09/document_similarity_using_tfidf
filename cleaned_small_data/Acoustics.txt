fundamental first overtones vibrating string earliest records study phenomenon attributed philosopher pythagoras century


century ancient greek philosopher pythagoras wanted know combinations musical sounds seemed beautiful others found answers terms numerical ratios representing harmonic overtone series string reputed observed lengths vibrating strings expressible ratios integers tones produced harmonious smaller integers harmonious sounds example string certain length would sound particularly harmonious string twice length factors equal modern parlance string sounds note plucked string twice long sound octave lower system musical tuning tones given 1615 ascending order7
aristotle 384322 understood sound consisted compressions rarefactions falls upon strikes next good expression nature wave motion
roman architect engineer vitruvius wrote treatise acoustic properties theaters including discussion interference echoes reverberation—the beginnings architectural acoustics9 book architectura books architecture vitruvius describes sound wave comparable water wave extended three dimensions interrupted obstructions would flow back break following waves described ascending seats ancient theaters designed prevent deterioration sound also recommended bronze vessels appropriate sizes placed theaters resonate fourth fifth double octave order resonate desirable harmonious notes101112




principles acoustics applied since ancient times roman theatre city amman


physical understanding acoustical processes advanced rapidly scientific revolution mainly galileo galilei 1564–1642 also marin mersenne 1588–1648 independently discovered complete laws vibrating strings completing pythagoras pythagoreans started 2000 years earlier galileo wrote waves produced vibrations sonorous body spread bringing tympanum stimulus mind interprets sound remarkable statement points beginnings physiological psychological acoustics experimental measurements speed sound carried successfully 1630 1680 number investigators prominently mersenne meanwhile newton 1642–1727 derived relationship wave velocity solids cornerstone physical acoustics principia 1687

definitionedit
acoustics defined ansiasa s112013 science sound including production transmission effects including biological psychological effects qualities room together determine character respect auditory effects
study acoustics revolves around generation propagation reception mechanical waves vibrations







steps shown diagram found acoustical event process many kinds cause natural volitional many kinds transduction process convert energy form sonic energy producing sound wave fundamental equation describes sound wave propagation acoustic wave equation phenomena emerge varied often complex wave carries energy throughout propagating medium eventually energy transduced forms ways natural andor volitionally contrived final effect purely physical reach biological volitional domains five basic steps found equally well whether talking earthquake submarine using sonar locate band playing rock concert
central stage acoustical process wave propagation falls within domain physical acoustics fluids sound propagates primarily pressure wave solids mechanical waves take many forms including longitudinal waves transverse waves surface waves
acoustics looks first pressure levels frequencies sound wave wave interacts environment interaction described either diffraction interference reflection three several media present refraction also occur transduction processes also special importance acoustics

spectrogram young girl saying


fluids water sound waves propagate disturbances ambient pressure level disturbance usually small still noticeable human smallest sound person hear known threshold hearing nine orders magnitude smaller ambient pressure loudness disturbances related sound pressure level measured logarithmic scale decibels
wave propagation frequencyedit
physicists acoustic engineers tend discuss sound pressure levels terms frequencies partly ears interpret sound experience higher pitched lower pitched sounds pressure vibrations higher lower number cycles second common technique acoustic measurement acoustic signals sampled time presented meaningful forms octave bands time frequency plots popular methods used analyze sound better understand acoustic phenomenon
entire spectrum divided three sections audio ultrasonic infrasonic audio range falls 20000 range important frequencies detected human range number applications including speech communication music ultrasonic range refers high frequencies 20000 higher range shorter wavelengths allow better resolution imaging technologies medical applications ultrasonography elastography rely ultrasonic frequency range spectrum lowest frequencies known infrasonic range frequencies used study geological phenomena earthquakes
analytic instruments spectrum analyzer facilitate visualization measurement acoustic signals properties spectrogram produced instrument graphical display time varying pressure level frequency profiles give specific acoustic signal defining character
