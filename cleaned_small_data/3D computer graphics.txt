computer graphics threedimensional computer graphics contrast computer graphics graphics threedimensional representation geometric data often cartesian stored computer purposes performing calculations rendering images images stored viewing later displayed realtime
computer graphics rely many algorithms computer vector graphics wireframe model computer raster graphics final rendered display computer graphics software distinction occasionally blurred applications techniques achieve effects lighting rendering techniques
computer graphics often referred models apart rendered graphic model contained within graphical data file however differences model mathematical representation threedimensional object model technically graphic displayed model displayed visually twodimensional image process called rendering used nongraphical computer simulations calculations printing models similarly rendered physical representation model limitations accurate rendering match virtual model

historyedit
main article history computer animation
william fetter credited coining term computer graphics 196112 describe work boeing first displays computer animation futureworld 1976 included animation human face hand originally appeared 1972 experimental short computer animated hand created university utah students edwin catmull fred parke3
computer graphics software began appearing home computers late 1970s earliest known example graphics computer graphics effects written kazumasa mitazawa released june 1978 apple ii45
overviewedit
computer graphics creation falls three basic phases

modeling process forming computer model objects shape
layout animation placement movement objects within scene
rendering computer calculations based light placement surface types qualities generate image

modelingedit
main article modeling
model describes process forming shape object common sources models artist engineer originates computer kind modeling tool models scanned computer realworld objects models also produced procedurally physical simulation basically model formed points called vertices vertexes define shape form polygons polygon area formed least three vertexes triangle polygon points ngoncitation needed overall integrity model suitability animation depend structure polygons
materials texturesedit
includes giving model properties render engine uses render model unbiased render engine like blender cycles give model materials tell engine treat light hits surface also textures used give material color like color albedo give surface features like bump normal maps also used deform model self like displacement
layout animationedit
main article computer animation
rendering image objects must laid place scene defines spatial relationships objects including location size animation refers temporal description object moves deforms time popular methods include keyframing inverse kinematics motion capture techniques often used combination animation physical simulation also specifies motion
renderingedit
main article rendering
rendering converts model image either simulating light transport photorealistic images applying style nonphotorealistic rendering basic operations realistic rendering transport much light gets place another scattering surfaces interact light step usually performed using computer graphics software graphics altering scene suitable form rendering also involves projection displays threedimensional image dimensions although modeling software perform rendering well autodesk blender exclusive rendering software also exists


examples rendering

right experience curiosity realtime application leverages rendering capabilities browsers webgl


softwareedit
computer graphics software produces computergenerated imagery modeling rendering produces models analytic scientific industrial purposes
modelingedit
main article modeling software
modeling software class computer graphics software used produce models individual programs class called modeling applications modelers
modelers allow users create alter models mesh users subtract stretch otherwise change mesh desire models viewed variety angles usually simultaneously models rotated view zoomed
modelers export models files imported applications long metadata compatible many modelers allow importers exporters pluggedin read write data native formats applications
modelers contain number related features tracers rendering alternatives texture mapping facilities also contain features support allow animation models able generate fullmotion video series rendered scenes animation
computeraided designedit
main article computeraided design
computer aided design software employ fundamental modeling techniques modeling software goal differs used computeraided engineering computeraided manufacturing finite element analysis product lifecycle management printing computeraided architectural design
complementary toolsedit
producing video studios edit composite video using programs adobe premiere final midlevel autodesk combustion digital fusion shake highend match moving software commonly used match live video computergenerated video keeping sync camera moves
realtime computer graphics engines create cinematic production called machinima
communitiesedit
multitude websites designed help educate support graphic artists managed software developers content providers standalone sites well communities allow members seek advice post tutorials provide product reviews post examples work
differences types computer graphicsedit
distinction photorealistic graphicsedit
also still life 21st century
computer graphics appear based wireframe model computer graphics photorealistic effects often achieved without wireframe modeling sometimes indistinguishable final form graphic software includes filters applied vector graphics raster graphics transparent layers visual artists also copy visualize effects manually render photorealistic effects without filters
pseudo3d true 3dedit
main article
video games restricted projections threedimensional environments isometric graphics virtual cameras fixed angles either improve performance game engine stylistic gameplay concerns games said pseudo3d graphics contrast games using computer graphics without restrictions said true
