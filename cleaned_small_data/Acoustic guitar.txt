acoustic guitar guitar produces sound acoustically—by transmitting vibration strings air—as opposed relying electronic amplification electric guitar sound waves strings acoustic guitar resonate guitars body creating sound typically involves sound board sound strengthen vibrations strings
main source sound acoustic guitar string plucked strummed finger pick string vibrates necessary frequency also creates many harmonics various different frequencies frequencies produced depend string length mass tension string causes soundboard sound vibrate resonances certain frequencies amplify string harmonics strongly others hence affecting timbre produced instrument

historyedit
gitterns small plucked guitar first small guitarlike instruments created middle ages round back like lute1 modern guitar shaped instruments seen renaissance body size began take guitarlike shape
earliest string instruments related guitar structure broadly known vihuelas within spanish musical culture vihuelas string instruments commonly seen 16th century renaissance later spanish writers distinguished instruments categories vihuelas vihuela arco instrument mimicked violin vihuela penola played plectrum hand played hand known vihuela mano vihuela mano shared extreme similarities renaissance guitar used hand movement sound hole sound chamber instrument create music2
real production guitars kicked france popularity production first began increasing large quantities spain became homeland guitar little information early makers unlike france many inventors artists first began overproducing instruments music production became large instruments early famous creators gaspard duyffooprucgar3 string instrument maker sold copies guitar makers lyon benoist lejeune guitar maker offered sold guitar copies duyffoprucgars instruments later imprisoned using mark work time production increasing tremendously robert claude denis appeared overproducing early renaissance guitar paris france father robert claude produced hundreds guitars increased popularity instrument greatly great many guitar inventors time word guiterne gradually shifted guitarre sixteenth seventeenth centuries4

basic anatomy acoustic guitar


acoustic guitars soundboard also strong effect loudness guitar woods good transmitting sound like spruce commonly used soundboard7 amplification actually occurs process external energy added increase loudness sound would case electronic amplifier energy provided plucking string without soundboard string would without actually moving much soundboard increases surface vibrating area process called mechanical impedance matching soundboard move much easily string alone large flat increases entire systems energy transfer efficiency much louder sound emitted

many acoustic guitars incorporate rosettes around sound hole


acoustic guitar amplified using various types pickups microphones however amplification acoustic guitars many problems audio feedback 1960s ovations parabolic bowls dramatically reduced feedback allowing greater amplification acoustic guitars11 1970s ovation developed thinner soundboards carbonbased composites laminating thin layer birch adamas model viewed radical designs history acoustic guitars adamas model dissipated soundhole traditional soundboard among small soundholes upper chamber guitar yielding greater volume reducing feedback amplification11 another method reducing feedback rubber plastic disc sound hole

common guitar body shapes range parlor grand concert auditorium dreadnought jumbo


common body shapes modern acoustic guitars smallest largest
range smallest common body shape sometimes called mini jumbo threequarters size jumboshaped guitar range shape typically rounded back improve projection smaller body13 smaller body scale length make range guitar option players struggle larger body guitars
parlor parlor guitars small compact bodies described “punchy” sounding delicate tone14 smaller body makes parlor comfortable option players find large body guitars uncomfortable
grand concert midsized body shape deep fullsize guitars full waist smaller body grand concert guitars controlled overtone15 often used sound projection recording
auditorium similar dimensions dreadnought body shape16 much pronounced waist shifting waist provides different tones stand auditorium body shape newer body compared shapes dreadnought
dreadnought classic guitar body shape style designed martin guitars17 produce deeper sound classicstyle guitars resonant bass used years still popular body style acoustic guitarscitation needed body large waist guitar pronounced auditorium grand concert bodies allows midrange frequencies stand helping guitar ensemble instrumentscitation needed
jumbo largest standard guitar body shape found acoustic guitars large body provides punch volume accenting “boomy” guitarcitation needed jumbo bigger grand auditorium similarly proportioned generally designed provide deep tone similar dreadnoughts designed gibson compete dreadnought17 maximum resonant space greater volume sustain come expense oversized deep sounding thus somewhat difficult playcitation needed foremost example style gibson j200 like dreadnought guitar manufacturers least jumbo model
