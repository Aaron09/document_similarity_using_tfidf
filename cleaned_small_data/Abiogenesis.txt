etymologyedit
main article biogenesis
term biogenesis usually credited either henry charlton bastian thomas henry huxley86 bastian used term around 1869 unpublished exchange john tyndall mean lifeorigination commencement 1870 huxley president british association advancement science delivered address entitled biogenesis abiogenesis87 introduced term biogenesis opposite meaning bastians well abiogenesis

thus hypothesis living matter always arises agency preexisting living matter took definite shape henceforward right considered claim refuted particular case production living matter could admitted careful reasoners necessary refer hypothesis frequently save circumlocution shall call hypothesis biogenesis shall term contrary doctrine–that living matter produced living matter–the hypothesis abiogenesis87

subsequently preface bastians 1871 book modes origin lowest organisms88 bastian referred possible confusion huxleys usage explicitly renounced meaning

word explanation seems necessary regard introduction term archebiosis originally unpublished writings adopted word biogenesis express meaning—viz lifeorigination commencement mean time word biogenesis made quite independently distinguished biologist huxley wished make bear totally different meaning also introduced word abiogenesis informed however best authority neither words can—with regard language derived—be supposed bear meanings late publicly assigned wishing avoid needless confusion therefore renounced word biogenesis reason given unable adopt term compelled introduce word order designate process living matter supposed come independently preexisting living matter89
