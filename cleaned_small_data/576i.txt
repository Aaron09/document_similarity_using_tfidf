speedupedit
motion pictures typically shot film frames second telecined played back pals standard frames second films faster also applies series shot film digital 24p3 unlike ntscs telecine system uses pulldown convert frames second frame rate speedup results telecined video running shorter original film well equivalent ntsc telecined video
depending sound system also slightly increases pitch soundtrack 7067 cents 07067 semitone recently digital conversion methods used algorithms preserve original pitch soundtrack although frame rate conversion still results faster playback
conversion methods exist convert frames second video frames second speed increase however image quality suffers conversions type used method commonly employed conversions done digitally using computer software like virtualdub employed situations importance preserving speed video outweighs need image quality
many movie enthusiasts prefer ntsc despite formers speedup latter results telecine judder visual distortion present spedup video4 states majority authorities subject favour ntsc playback quality also reviewers often make mention cause example ntsc article5 founder michaeldvd says personally find pulldown intolerable find hard watch movie ntsc review frequency6 reviewers mentions pulldown artefacts associated ntsc format prefer pretty much week issue modern upconverting players personal computers play back 2397 framesâ€“encoded video true frame rate without pulldown
