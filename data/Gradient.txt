This article is about the gradient of a multivariate function. For direction and steepness of a line on a graph, see Slope. For the slope of a road or other physical feature, see Grade (slope). For the similarly spelled unit of angle also known as gon, see Gradian. For other uses, see Gradient (disambiguation).




In the above two images, the values of the function are represented in black and white, black representing higher values, and its corresponding gradient is represented by blue arrows.


In mathematics, the gradient is a multi-variable generalization of the derivative. While a derivative can be defined on functions of a single variable, for functions of several variables, the gradient takes its place. The gradient is a vector-valued function, as opposed to a derivative, which is scalar-valued.
Like the derivative, the gradient represents the slope of the tangent of the graph of the function. More precisely, the gradient points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the function, and its magnitude is the slope of the graph in that direction. The components of the gradient in coordinates are the coefficients of the variables in the equation of the tangent space to the graph. This characterizing property of the gradient allows it to be defined independently of a choice of coordinate system, as a vector field whose components in a coordinate system will transform when going from one coordinate system to another.
The Jacobian is the generalization of the gradient for vector-valued functions of several variables and differentiable maps between Euclidean spaces or, more generally, manifolds. A further generalization for a function between Banach spaces is the Fréchet derivative.

Motivation[edit]




Gradient of the 2D function f(x, y) = xe−(x2 + y2) is plotted as blue arrows over the pseudocolor plot of the function.


Consider a room in which the temperature is given by a scalar field, T, so at each point (x, y, z) the temperature is T(x, y, z). (Assume that the temperature does not change over time.) At each point in the room, the gradient of T at that point will show the direction in which the temperature rises most quickly. The magnitude of the gradient will determine how fast the temperature rises in that direction.
Consider a surface whose height above sea level at point (x, y) is H(x, y). The gradient of H at a point is a vector pointing in the direction of the steepest slope or grade at that point. The steepness of the slope at that point is given by the magnitude of the gradient vector.
The gradient can also be used to measure how a scalar field changes in other directions, rather than just the direction of greatest change, by taking a dot product. Suppose that the steepest slope on a hill is 40%. If a road goes directly up the hill, then the steepest slope on the road will also be 40%. If, instead, the road goes around the hill at an angle, then it will have a shallower slope. For example, if the angle between the road and the uphill direction, projected onto the horizontal plane, is 60°, then the steepest slope along the road will be 20%, which is 40% times the cosine of 60°.
This observation can be mathematically stated as follows. If the hill height function H is differentiable, then the gradient of H dotted with a unit vector gives the slope of the hill in the direction of the vector. More precisely, when H is differentiable, the dot product of the gradient of H with a given unit vector is equal to the directional derivative of H in the direction of that unit vector.
Definition[edit]




The gradient of the function f(x,y) = −(cos2x + cos2y)2 depicted as a projected vector field on the bottom plane.


The gradient (or gradient vector field) of a scalar function f(x1, x2, x3,... xn) is denoted ∇f or ∇→f where ∇ (the nabla symbol) denotes the vector differential operator, del. The notation grad f is also commonly used for the gradient. The gradient of f is defined as the unique vector field whose dot product with any unit vector v at each point x is the directional derivative of f along v. That is,

{\displaystyle {\big (}\nabla f(x){\big )}\cdot \mathbf {v} =D_{\mathbf {v} }f(x).}



When a function also depends on a parameter such as time, the gradient often refers simply to the vector of its spatial derivatives only (see Spatial gradient).

In the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with a Euclidean metric, the gradient, if it exists, is given by:

where i, j, k are the standard unit vectors in the directions of the x, y and z coordinates, respectively. For example, the gradient of the function

where φ is the azimuthal or azimuth angle, z is the axial coordinate, and eρ, eφ and ez are unit vectors pointing along the coordinate directions.

Linear approximation to a function[edit]
The gradient of a function f from the Euclidean space ℝn to ℝ at any particular point x0 in ℝn characterizes the best linear approximation to f at x0. The approximation is as follows:

)

f

(

{\displaystyle f(x)\approx f(x_{0})+(\nabla f)_{x_{0}}\cdot (x-x_{0})}



for x close to x0, where (∇f )x0 is the gradient of f computed at x0, and the dot denotes the dot product on ℝn. This equation is equivalent to the first two terms in the multivariable Taylor series expansion of f at x0.
Differential or (exterior) derivative[edit]
The best linear approximation to a differentiable function





f

{\displaystyle f:\mathbb {R} ^{n}\to \mathbb {R} }



at a point x in ℝn is a linear map from ℝn to ℝ which is often denoted by dfx or Df(x) and called the differential or (total) derivative of f at x. The gradient is therefore related to the differential by the formula

for any v ∈ ℝn. The function df, which maps x to dfx, is called the differential or exterior derivative of f and is an example of a differential 1-form.
If ℝn is viewed as the space of (dimension n) column vectors (of real numbers), then one can regard df as the row vector with components

so that dfx(v) is given by matrix multiplication. Assuming the standard Euclidean metric on ℝn, the gradient is then the corresponding column vector, i.e.,

Gradient as a derivative[edit]
Let U be an open set in ℝn. If the function f : U → ℝ is differentiable, then the differential of f is the (Fréchet) derivative of f. Thus ∇f is a function from U to the space ℝ such that






lim

h

{\displaystyle \lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {\|f(x+h)-f(x)-\nabla f(x)\cdot h\|}{\|h\|}}=0}



where · is the dot product.
As a consequence, the usual properties of the derivative hold for the gradient:
Linearity[edit]
The gradient is linear in the sense that if f and g are two real-valued functions differentiable at the point a ∈ ℝn, and α and β are two constants, then αf + βg is differentiable at a, and moreover

{\displaystyle \nabla \left(\alpha f+\beta g\right)(a)=\alpha \nabla f(a)+\beta \nabla g(a).}



Product rule[edit]
If f and g are real-valued functions differentiable at a point a ∈ ℝn, then the product rule asserts that the product fg is differentiable at a, and

{\displaystyle \nabla (fg)(a)=f(a)\nabla g(a)+g(a)\nabla f(a).}



Chain rule[edit]
Suppose that f : A → ℝ is a real-valued function defined on a subset A of ℝn, and that f is differentiable at a point a. There are two forms of the chain rule applying to the gradient. First, suppose that the function g is a parametric curve; that is, a function g : I → ℝn maps a subset I ⊂ ℝ into ℝn. If g is differentiable at a point c ∈ I such that g(c) = a, then

{\displaystyle (f\circ g)'(c)=\nabla f(a)\cdot g'(c),}



where ∘ is the composition operator: ( f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)).
More generally, if instead I ⊂ ℝk, then the following holds:

{\displaystyle \nabla (f\circ g)(c)={\big (}Dg(c){\big )}^{\mathsf {T}}{\big (}\nabla f(a){\big )}}



where (Dg)T denotes the transpose Jacobian matrix.
For the second form of the chain rule, suppose that h : I → ℝ is a real valued function on a subset I of ℝ, and that h is differentiable at the point f(a) ∈ I. Then





∇
(
h

{\displaystyle \nabla (h\circ f)(a)=h'{\big (}f(a){\big )}\nabla f(a).}



Further properties and applications[edit]
Level sets[edit]
See also: Level set § Level sets versus the gradient
A level surface, or isosurface, is the set of all points where some function has a given value.
If f is differentiable, then the dot product (∇f )x ⋅ v of the gradient at a point x with a vector v gives the directional derivative of f at x in the direction v. It follows that in this case the gradient of f is orthogonal to the level sets of f. For example, a level surface in three-dimensional space is defined by an equation of the form F(x, y, z) = c. The gradient of F is then normal to the surface.
More generally, any embedded hypersurface in a Riemannian manifold can be cut out by an equation of the form F(P) = 0 such that dF is nowhere zero. The gradient of F is then normal to the hypersurface.
Similarly, an affine algebraic hypersurface may be defined by an equation F(x1,... xn) = 0, where F is a polynomial. The gradient of F is zero at a singular point of the hypersurface (this is the definition of a singular point). At a non-singular point, it is a nonzero normal vector.
Conservative vector fields and the gradient theorem[edit]
Main article: Gradient theorem
The gradient of a function is called a gradient field. A (continuous) gradient field is always a conservative vector field: its line integral along any path depends only on the endpoints of the path, and can be evaluated by the gradient theorem (the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals). Conversely, a (continuous) conservative vector field is always the gradient of a function.
Generalizations[edit]
Gradient of a vector[edit]
See also: Covariant derivative
Since the total derivative of a vector field is a linear mapping from vectors to vectors, it is a tensor quantity.

where gjk are the components of the inverse metric tensor and the ei are the coordinate basis vectors.

Riemannian manifolds[edit]

where gx( , ) denotes the inner product of tangent vectors at x defined by the metric g and ∂X f is the function that takes any point x ∈ M to the directional derivative of f in the direction X, evaluated at x. In other words, in a coordinate chart φ from an open subset of M to an open subset of ℝn, (∂X f )(x) is given by:
