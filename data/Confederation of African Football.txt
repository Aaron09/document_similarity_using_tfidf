The Confederation of African Football (CAF, /kæf/; French: Confédération Africaine de Football; Arabic: الإتحاد الأفريقي لكرة القدم‎) is the administrative and controlling body for African association football.
CAF represents the national football associations of Africa, runs continental, national, and club competitions, and controls the prize money, regulations and media rights to those competitions.
CAF is the biggest of the six continental confederations of FIFA. Since the expansion of the number of teams at the World Cup finals to 32 in 1998, CAF has been allocated five places, though this was expanded to six for the 2010 tournament in South Africa, to include the hosts.
CAF was established on 8 February 1957 in Khartoum, Sudan,[1] by Egyptian, Ethiopian, South African and Sudanese[2] FAs, following former discussions between the Egyptian, Somali, South African and Sudanese FAs earlier on 7 June 1956 at the Avenida Hotel in Lisbon, Portugal. Its first headquarters was situated in Khartoum for some months until a fire outbreak in the offices of the Sudanese Football Association when the organization moved near Cairo, Egypt. Youssef Mohammad was the first General Secretary and Abdel Aziz Abdallah Salem the president. Since 2002, the administrative center has been located in 6th of October City, Cairo, Egypt. CAF currently has 56 member associations: 55 are full members, including former associate Zanzibar (admitted in March 2017),[3] while Réunion remains an associate member (see the CAF Members and Zones section below).
The current CAF President is Ahmad Ahmad, who was elected on 16 March 2017.[4] The 1st Vice-President is Kwesi Nyantakyi from Ghana, the 2nd vice president is called Constant Omari Selemani from RD Congo and the 3rd Vice president is Fouzi Lekjaa from Morocco[5]. Current CAF General Secretary is Egyptian Amr Fahmy since 16 November 2017.[6]

Competitions[edit]
International[edit]
The main competition for men's national teams is the Africa Cup of Nations, started in 1957. In 2009, CAF will be organising another competition for men's national teams, the African Nations Championship composed exclusively of national players playing in the national championship. CAF also runs national competitions at Under-20 and Under-17 levels. For women's national teams, CAF operates the Africa Women Cup of Nations for senior national sides and the African U-20 Cup of Nations for Women at under-20 level, since 2008 there is an African U-17 Cup of Nations for Women for under-17 sides.
Club[edit]
CAF also runs the two main club competitions in Africa: the CAF Champions League was first held in 1964, and was known as the African Cup of Champions Clubs (or just African Cup) until 1997; and the CAF Confederation Cup, for national cup winners and high-placed league teams, was launched by CAF in 2004 as a successor to the African Cup Winners' Cup (begun in 1975). A third competition, the CAF Cup, started in 1992 and was absorbed into the CAF Confederation Cup in 2004.[8]
The CAF Super Cup, which pits the winners of the Champions League against the winners of the CAF Confederation Cup (previously the winners of the Cup Winners' Cup), came into being in 1992.
The Afro-Asian Club Championship was jointly organised with AFC between the winners of the CAF Champions League and the winners of the AFC Champions League. The last Afro-Asian Club Championship took place in 1998.
