History[edit]
For more details on AllMovie's history, see All Media Network § History.
AllMovie was founded by popular-culture archivist Michael Erlewine, who also founded AllMusic and AllGame.
The AllMovie database was licensed to tens of thousands of distributors and retailers for point-of-sale systems, websites and kiosks. The AllMovie database is comprehensive, including basic product information, cast and production credits, plot synopsis, professional reviews, biographies, relational links and more.
AllMovie data was accessed on the web at the AllMovie.com website. It was also available via the AMG LASSO media recognition service, which can automatically recognize DVDs.
In late 2007, Macrovision (now Rovi Corporation) acquired AMG for a reported $72 million.[5]
The AMG consumer facing web properties AllMusic.com, AllMovie.com and AllGame.com were sold by Rovi in August 2013 to All Media Network, LLC. The buyers also include the original founders of SideReel and Ackrell Capital investor Mike Ackrell.[6]
All Media Network offices are located in San Francisco, California, and Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States.
