History[edit]
The roots of the company date back to 1923, when William Warder Norton founded the firm with his wife Mary Norton, and became its first president.[1] Storer D. Lunt took over in 1945 after Norton's death, and was succeeded by George Brockway (1957–1976), Donald S. Lamm (1976–1994), and now W. Drake McFeely (1994–present).[2]
Publishing[edit]
W. W. Norton & Company is an employee-owned publisher in the United States,[3] which publishes fiction, nonfiction, poetry, college textbooks, cookbooks, art books, and professional books.[4]
Series[edit]
Norton Anthologies[edit]
Norton Anthologies collect canonical works from various literatures; perhaps the best known anthology in the series is the Norton Anthology of English Literature, now in its 9th edition. Norton Anthologies offer general headnotes on each author, a general introduction to each period of literature, and annotations for every anthologised text.
Norton Critical Editions[edit]
Like Penguin Classics, Norton Critical Editions provide reprints of classic literature (and in some cases, classic non-fiction works, such as the writings of Darwin). However, unlike most critical editions, all Norton Critical Editions provide a selection of contextual documents, and critical essays along with an edited text. Annotations to the text are provided as footnotes, rather than endnotes as well.
