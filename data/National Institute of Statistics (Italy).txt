History[edit]
Istat was created in 1926 as "Central Institute of Statistics" (Istituto Centrale di Statistica), to collect and organize essential data about the nation. It took its current denomination with the reform of 1989. This also gave Istat statutory responsibility for the coordination and standardization of official statistics collected or published under the aegis of the national statistical system SISTAN, whose membership includes the statistical offices of ministries, national agencies, regions, provinces, communes, chambers of commerce, and similar bodies. Since 4 August 2009, Enrico Giovannini, former Chief statistician of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), has been the President of the institute.
