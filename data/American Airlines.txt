History[edit]
Main article: History of American Airlines
American Airlines was started in 1930 via a union of more than eighty small airlines.[10]
The two organizations from which American Airlines was originated were Robertson Aircraft Corporation and Colonial Air Transport. The former was first formed in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company The Aviation Corporation. This in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as American Airways. In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system, and was renamed American Airlines. Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing Trans World Airlines in 2001.
In 2011, due to a downturn in the airline industry, American Airlines' parent company AMR Corporation filed for bankruptcy protection. In 2013, US Airways and American Airlines merged. Eventually US Airways management and operations from both airlines were merged under one operating certificate to create the largest United States airline which kept the American Airlines brand name.[11]
Corporate affairs[edit]
Headquarters[edit]
American Airlines is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, adjacent to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.[12] The headquarters is located in two office buildings in the CentrePort office complex and these buildings together have about 1,400,000 square feet (130,000 m2) of space. As of 2014[update] over 4,300 employees work at this complex.[13]
Before it was headquartered in Texas, American Airlines was headquartered at 633 Third Avenue in the Murray Hill area of Midtown Manhattan, New York City.[14][15] In 1979, American moved its headquarters to a site at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, which affected up to 1,300 jobs. Mayor of New York City Ed Koch described the move as a "betrayal" of New York City.[16] American moved to two leased office buildings in Grand Prairie, Texas.[17] On January 17, 1983, the airline finished moving into a $150 million ($369,000,000 when adjusted for inflation), 550,000-square-foot (51,000 m2) facility in Fort Worth; $147 million (about $361,000,000 when adjusted for inflation) in Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport bonds financed the headquarters. The airline began leasing the facility from the airport, which owns the facility.[17]
As of 2015 American Airlines is the corporation with the largest presence in Fort Worth.[18]
New headquarters[edit]
In 2015, the airline announced it will build a new headquarters in Fort Worth. Groundbreaking began in the spring of 2016 and occupancy is scheduled for summer 2019.[19] The airline plans to house 5,000 new workers in the building.[18]
It will be located on a 41-acre (17 ha) property adjacent to the airline's flight academy and conference and training center, west of Texas State Highway 360, 2 miles (3.2 km)[19] west from the current headquarters. The airline will lease a total of 300 acres (120 ha) from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and this area will include the headquarters.[18]Construction of the new headquarters began after the demolition of the Sabre facility previously on the site.[19]
The airline considered developing a new headquarters in Irving, on the Texas Stadium site, before deciding to keep the headquarters in Fort Worth.[18]
U.S. federal government subsidies[edit]
As of November 2013 American Airlines and American Eagle received $10,011,836 in annual federal subsidies for Essential Air Services.[20] These subsidies are awarded by public tender and ensure that small, rural airports can be connected to the national air network.
Labor unions[edit]

The Allied Pilots Association (APA) is an in-house union which represents the nearly 15,000 American Airlines pilots; it was created in 1963 after the pilots left the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA).[21] The majority of American Eagle pilots are ALPA members.[22]
The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA) represents American Airlines flight attendants, including former USAirways flight attendants.[23]
Flight Attendants at American wholly owned Regional Carriers (Envoy - former American Eagle), Piedmont and PSA are all represented by Association of Flight Attendants - Communications Workers of America (AFA-CWA). USAirways Flight Attendants were active members of AFA-CWA prior to the merger. They are honorary lifetime members. AFA-CWA is the largest Flight Attendant Union in the industry and is operated by Flight Attendants.
The Transport Workers Union-International Association of Machinists alliance (TWU-IAM) represents the majority of American Airlines employed fleet service clerks, mechanics and other ground workers.[24]
American's customer service and gate employees belong to the Communications Workers of America/International Brotherhood of Teamsters Passenger Service Association.[25]

Environmental record[edit]
Violations occurring over a 4½ year period—from October 1993 to July 1998—targeted American Airlines for using high-sulfur fuel in motor vehicles at 10 major airports around the country. Under the federal Clean Air Act high sulfur fuel cannot be used in motor vehicles. American Airlines promptly identified and corrected these violations of the Clean Air Act.[26]
American Airlines' wastewater treatment plant recycles water used at the base to wash aircraft, process rinse water tanks, and irrigate landscape. That alone has saved almost $1 million since 2002. In addition to that, American Airlines has also won the award for the reduction of hazardous waste that saved them $229,000 after a $2,000 investment. A bar code system is used to track hazardous waste. It has led to reduction of waste by 50 percent since 2000.[27]

Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]




American Airlines' fourth logo, used from 1967 until 2013


In 1931, Goodrich Murphy, an American employee, designed the AA logo.[33] The logo was redesigned by Massimo Vignelli in 1967.[34][35] Thirty years later, in 1997, American Airlines was able to make its logo Internet-compatible by buying the domain AA.com. AA is also American's two-letter IATA airline designator.
On January 16, 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign with FutureBrand dubbed, "A New American". This included a new logo replacing the logo used since 1967. American Airlines calls the new logo the "Flight Symbol, incorporating the eagle, star, and the letter “A” of the classic logo.[36]
Livery[edit]

American's early liveries varied widely, but a common livery was adopted in the 1930s, featuring an eagle painted on the fuselage.[37] The eagle became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of American Eagle Airlines. Propeller aircraft featured an international orange lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage, which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets.

In the late 1960s, American commissioned designer Massimo Vignelli to develop a new livery. The original design called for a red, white, and blue stripe on the fuselage, and a simple "AA" logo, without an eagle, on the tail; instead, Vignelli created a highly stylized eagle, which remained the company's logo until 2013. In 1999, American painted a new Boeing 757 (N679AN) in its 1959 international orange livery. One Boeing 777 and one Boeing 757 were painted in standard livery with a pink ribbon on the sides and on the tail, in support of Susan G. Komen for the Cure. One Boeing 757 is painted with a yellow ribbon on the tailfin on the aircraft and on the side of the body says "Flagship Freedom". American Eagle, the airline's regional airline has the same special livery on ERJ-145 aircraft.

On January 17, 2013, American unveiled a new livery.[38] Before then, American had been the only major U.S. airline to leave most of its aircraft surfaces unpainted. This was because C. R. Smith hated painted aircraft, and refused to use any liveries that involved painting the entire plane. Robert "Bob" Crandall later justified the distinctive natural metal finish by noting that less paint reduced the aircraft's weight, thus saving on fuel costs.[39]

In January 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign dubbed, "The New American". In addition to a new logo, American Airlines introduced a new livery for its fleet. The airline calls the new livery and branding "a clean and modern update".[36] The current design features an abstract American flag on the tail, along with a silver-painted fuselage, as a throw-back to the old livery. The new design was painted by Leading Edge Aviation Services in California.[40] Doug Parker, the incoming CEO indicated that the new livery could be short-lived, stating that "maybe we need to do something slightly different than that ... The only reason this is an issue now is because they just did it right in the middle, which kind of makes it confusing, so that gives us an opportunity, actually, to decide if we are going to do something different because we have so many airplanes to paint".[41]
In the end, American let its employees decide the new livery's fate. On an internal website for employees, American posted two options, one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery. All of the American Airlines Group employees (including US Airways and other affiliates) were able to vote.[42] American ultimately decided to keep the new look. Parker announced that American would keep a US Airways heritage aircraft in the fleet, with plans to add a heritage TWA aircraft and a heritage American plane with the old livery.[43]

Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport – American closed its San Juan hub in 2012. American used San Juan as a connection point for Caribbean destinations using ATR-72 commuter aircraft.

American operated interchange flight services in conjunction with Alaska Airlines during the 1970s between Texas and Alaska during the construction of the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. This interchange agreement allowed for single, no change of aircraft service between Houston, Texas and Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, and Anchorage, Alaska and Fairbanks, Alaska. The round trip routing of this interchange flight was Houston-Dallas/Fort Worth-Seattle-Anchorage-Fairbanks with Seattle, Washington serving as the interchange point where flight and cabin crews were changed from one airline to the other. Boeing 727-200 jetliners provided by both American and Alaska Airlines were utilized to provide this interchange service.[citation needed]
American Airlines is the only US carrier that flies to Barranquilla, Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Cali, Cap-Haitien, Caracas, Cienfuegos, Fort-de-France, Guayaquil, La Paz, Manaus, Maracaibo, Montevideo, Pointe-a-Pitre, San Salvador (Bahamas), Santa Cruz de la Sierra and Varadero. It is also the leading U.S. carrier to Cuba in terms of passenger volume.

Main article: American Airlines fleet




An American Airlines Boeing 777-300ER in the new livery landing at London Heathrow Airport in 2013.


As of October 2017, American Airlines operates a fleet of 947 aircraft, making it the largest commercial fleet in the world. It operates a mix of Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, and McDonnell Douglas aircraft.
Over two thirds of American's aircraft are narrow-bodies, mainly Airbus A320 series and Boeing 737-800. It also operates Boeing 757, Embraer 190 and McDonnell Douglas MD-82/83, but most of them are planned to be phased out within five years.
Its wide-body aircraft are mainly Boeing airliners. It is the third-largest operator of the Boeing 767 series and the fifth-largest operator of the Boeing 777 series. It also operates the Airbus A330.
On July 20, 2011, American announced an order for 460 narrowbody jets including 260 Airbus A320s.[88] The order broke Boeing's monopoly with the airline and forced Boeing into the re-engined 737 MAX.[89] As this sale included a Most-Favoured-Customer Clause, the European airframer has to refund any difference to American if it sells to another airline at a lower price, so Airbus can't give a competitive price to competitor United Airlines, leaving it to a Boeing-skewed fleet.[90]

Transcontinental[edit]
American has dedicated 17 Airbus A321s (A321T) in its fleet for the specific use of flying transcontinental routes between New York JFK - Los Angeles LAX and New York JFK - San Francisco SFO. These aircraft offer two premium cabins, First Class and Business Class, which are unique among domestic mainline aircraft in American's fleet:
• First Class: Fully lie-flat seats manufactured by Zodiac Seats France and designed for and designed for American Airlines with direct aisle access in a 1-1 reverse herringbone configuration.

• Early boarding
• First Class/Business Class amenity kit
• A pair of Bose QuietComfort Acoustic Noise Canceling Headsets to use during flight
• Premium alcoholic beverages and wine selections (including pre-departure beverage service)
• Chef-inspired dining options
Domestic First Class[edit]
First Class is offered on all domestic mainline aircraft, as well as regional aircraft with more than 50 seats. When such aircraft are used on flights to international destinations including Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, the First Class cabin is branded as Business Class. Seats range from 19–21 inches (48–53 cm) in width and have 37–42 inches (94–106 cm) of pitch.[91] Dining options include free snacks, beverages, and alcohol on all flights, with three-course meals offered on flights 900 miles (1,448 km) or longer (select routes under 900 miles offer meal service).[92]
Premium Economy[edit]
On December 9, 2015, American announced a new Premium Economy product for most long-haul widebody aircraft. This new product will debut on the new 787-9s in late 2016 and will be available on the new A350s in 2018. It will also be retrofitted to all other widebody aircraft within the next three years, excluding 767s due to their upcoming retirement. The seats will be wider than standard Main Cabin seats and will offer 38" of pitch, 2" more than Main Cabin Extra seats, as well as a footrest. Premium Economy customers will also get two free checked bags, priority boarding, and enhanced food and drink service including free alcohol. This product will make American Airlines the first U.S. carrier to offer a four-cabin aircraft.[93]
Main Cabin Extra[edit]
American's economy plus product (not to be confused with premium economy), Main Cabin Extra, is available on most of the mainline fleet and American Eagle regional aircraft with more than 50 seats. Exceptions include a majority of former US Airways aircraft (as of May 2014), US Airways Express regional aircraft, and a handful of 777-200ERs that have yet to be retrofitted. Seats range from 17.2–19.5 inches (44–47 cm) in width and have 34–38 inches (86–97 cm) of pitch, which is 5–6 more inches of pitch offered in regular economy seating.[91] American will retain Main Cabin Extra when the new Premium Economy product enters service in late 2016.[93]
Main Cabin[edit]
Main Cabin is American's economy product, and is found on all mainline and regional aircraft in its fleet. Seats range from 17–18.5 inches (43–47 cm) in width and have 30–32 inches (76–81 cm) of pitch.[91] Newer aircraft, including all Boeing 777-300ER, refurbished Boeing 777-200ER's, all Boeing 787 Dreamliners, all Airbus A330s, all newly delivered Airbus A319s and Boeing 737s, and most newly delivered Airbus A321s, include seatback TVs, featuring AVOD in each seat.[citation needed]
Basic Economy[edit]
American's basic economy product, Basic Economy, is available on select routes. It is American's lowest main cabin fare. Basic economy is located in main cabin, but comes with restrictions. These restrictions include assigned seat at check in, no access to overhead bins, no upgrades or refunds, and boarding in the last group.[94]
American Airlines marketed increased legroom in economy class as "More Room Throughout Coach", also referred to as "MRTC" starting in February 2000.[95] Two rows of economy class seats were removed on Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft.[96] Amid financial losses, this scheme was discontinued in 2004.[96][97]
In May 2017, American announced they would be adding more seats to some of its Boeing 737 Max jetliners and reducing overall legroom in the basic economy class. The last three rows will lose two inches; going from the current 31 to 29 inches. The remainder of the economy cabin will have 30 inches of legroom. This compares to JetBlue with 34 inches of legroom and Spirit with 28 inches.[98]

Admirals Club[edit]




Admirals Club logo



Inside an Admirals Club



The Admirals Club was conceived by AA president C.R. Smith as a marketing promotion shortly after he was made an honorary Texas Ranger. Inspired by the Kentucky colonels and other honorary organizations, Smith decided to make particularly valued passengers "admirals" of the "Flagship fleet" (AA called its aircraft "Flagships" at the time).[99] The list of Admirals included many celebrities, politicians, and other VIPs, as well as more "ordinary" customers who had been particularly loyal to the airline.
There was no physical Admirals Club until shortly after the opening of LaGuardia Airport. During the airport's construction, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia had an upper-level lounge set aside for press conferences and business meetings. At one such press conference, he noted that the entire terminal was being offered for lease to airline tenants; after a reporter asked whether the lounge would be leased as well, LaGuardia replied that it would, and a vice president of AA immediately offered to lease the premises. The airline then procured a liquor license and began operating the lounge as the "Admirals Club" in 1939.[citation needed]
The second Admirals Club opened at Washington National Airport. Because it was illegal to sell alcohol in Virginia at the time, the club contained refrigerators for the use of its members, so they could store their own liquor at the airport.[citation needed] For many years, membership in the Admirals Club (and most other airline lounges) was by the airline's invitation. After a passenger sued for discrimination,[100] the Club (and most other airline lounges) switched to a paid membership program.
Flagship Lounge[edit]
Though affiliated with the Admirals Club and staffed by many of the same employees, the Flagship Lounge is a separate lounge specifically designed for customers flying in First Class on international flights and transcontinental domestic flights, as well as AAdvantage Executive Platinum and Oneworld Emerald frequent flyers. As of January 2018, Flagship Lounges are located at four airports: Chicago-O'Hare, Miami International, Los Angeles and New York-JFK.[101]
Accidents and incidents[edit]
Main article: List of American Airlines accidents and incidents
As of January 2018, the airline has had almost sixty aircraft hull losses due to all causes since the crash of an American Airways Ford 5-AT-C Trimotor in August 1931.[102][103] Of these most were propeller driven aircraft, including three Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop aircraft (of which one, the crash in 1959 of Flight 320, resulted in fatalities).[103] Seventeen jet aircraft have been written off due to crashes – including Flight 587 in 2001, Flight 965 in 1995, Flight 191 in 1979, Flight 1 in 1962 and two aircraft destroyed in the September 11 attacks – and other accidents (such as the Flight 383 engine failure and fire in 2016); two of these were training flights in which only the crew were killed and six resulted in no fatalities.[103] Another four jet aircraft have been written off due to incidents while they were parked between flights or while undergoing maintenance.[103]
In popular culture[edit]

In the 1960s, Mattel released a series of American Airlines Stewardess Barbie dolls.[104]
Throughout the 1990s, American Airlines was featured in John Hughes' Home Alone trilogy of movies.[105][106][107]
In August 2008, in a Season 2 episode of Mad Men (Episode 2, titled "Flight 1"), Pete Campbell's father is a passenger on American Airlines Flight 1 which crashes shortly after takeoff from Idlewild Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport), killing all the passengers and crew on board.
American Airlines was a sponsor of a travelogue segment of the Univision show Sábado Gigante titled La Cámara Viajera.
American Airlines was extensively featured in the 2009 movie Up in the Air as part of a marketing tie-in between the airline and Paramount Pictures.[108]
In 2013, American Airlines collaborated with Disney to promote Planes by featuring a cameo appearance of a passenger airliner named Tripp, with the American Airlines livery to promote its new image.[109]
Airport 1975 used a Boeing 747-123 Freighter (cargo variant) s/n 20390 (registration N9675), leased from American Airlines.[110]
