This is a list of ruling political parties by country, in the form of a table with a link to an overview of political parties in each country and showing which party system is dominant in each country. A political party is a political organization subscribing to a certain ideology or formed around very special issues with the aim to participate in power, usually by participating in elections. Individual parties are properly listed in separate articles under each nation.
The ruling party in a parliamentary system is the political party or coalition of the majority in parliament. It generally forms the central government.
