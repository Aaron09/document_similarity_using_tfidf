A size comparison of four of the largest aircraft.


This is a list of large aircraft.
The US Federal Aviation Administration defines a large aircraft as any aircraft with a certificated maximum takeoff weight of more than 12,500 lb (5,700 kg) [1]
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) defines a large aircraft as either "an aeroplane with a maximum take-off mass of more than 5,700 kilograms (12,600 pounds) or a multi-engined helicopter."[2]

Experimental and prototypes[edit]


Aircraft
First flight
Note


Bristol Brabazon[10]
19490994 !4 September 1949

Stratolaunch is an aircraft currently under construction in Mojave, CA. With a wingspan of 385 ft (117 m), it will be the world’s largest aircraft by wingspan and the largest all-composite aircraft ever built. It is designed as an aerial launch platform, capable of lifting orbital launch vehicles weighing up to 550,000 lb (250 t) to an altitude of 45,000 ft (14,000 m). A nearly-complete aircraft was first shown on 1 June 2017.


Projects[edit]


Aircraft
Design or Conception
Note


Airbus A380-900
20060000 !2006 development
Announced in 2006 as a derivative of the Airbus A380-800. World's highest-capacity passenger aircraft in history. In May 2010, Airbus announced that A380-900 development was postponed, until production of the A380-800 has stabilised.[13]


Beriev Be-2500
19800000 !1980s proposal
Would be the largest aircraft ever, if built; development started in the 1980s


Boeing New Large Airplane
19900000 !1990s proposal
Planned as a replacement for the 747, to be powered by the same engines used on the 777. Project canceled in the 1990s due to the airline industry's lack of interest for very large aircraft.


Boeing Pelican
19900000 !1990s proposal
Concept only for ground effect transport


Boeing 2707 SST
19600000 !1960s design. A mockup was built but no prototype.
Planned as an answer to the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic transport (SST). At 306 feet (93 m) long it would have been one of the longest airframes ever flown. Problems with the weight of the swing-wing mechanism and air friction heating in Mach 3 flight provoked a drastic redesign, by which time airline interest in SSTs was dropping because of environmental concerns. There was also political opposition to funding private industry. The U.S. Congress cut government funding in 1971 and airlines began canceling orders.


McDonnell Douglas MD-12
19900000 !1990 proposal
Proposed passenger aircraft, Designed to compete with the 747, project canceled in mid-1990s


Sukhoi KR-860
19900000 !1990s proposal
KR-860 (Kryl'ya Rossii or "Wings of Russia") early named as SKD-717 is super large transport aircraft with weights about 650 tonnes (Antonov An-225 weight is 600 tonnes), payload about 300 tonnes (An-225 payload is 250 tonnes) and 860 to 1000 passengers, a proposed Double decker wide-body superjumbo jet by Russian aerospace company Sukhoi.


Conroy Virtus
19740000 !1974
Proposed 140-metre wingspan aircraft capable of carrying Space Shuttle orbiter, or boosters, or Shuttle main tank


"Victory Bomber"
19400000 !1940/41
Proposed 50-ton 52-metre wingspan design by Barnes Wallis able to carry a ten-ton earthquake bomb (of his own design) and drop it from 14,000 m on strategic targets in Germany. Rejected by RAF due to lack of usefulness for other types of missions and unlikely to be completed before end of war.[14]


Skylon
current
Proposed 345-tonne reusable spaceplane
