History[edit]
The GRI was originally called the "Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities", and was first discussed in 1983.[2] Located in Santa Monica,[3] its first director (beginning in 1985) was Kurt W. Forster.[4] GRI's library had 30,000 volumes in 1983, but grew to 450,000 volumes by 1986.[5]
In a statement upon his departure in 1992, Forster summarized his tenure as "Beginning with the rudiments of a small museum library... the center grew... to become one of the nation's preeminent research centers for arts and culture...".[4] In 1994, Salvatore Settis, a professor of the history of classical art and archeology in Italy, became the director of the Center.[6] By 1996, the Center's name had been changed to "Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities",[7] and by 1999 it was known simply as "Getty Research Institute".[8]
Among GRI's special projects was "L.A. as Subject: The Transformative Culture of Los Angeles Communities" conducted between 1995 and 1999, whose purposes included "enhanc[ing] existing resources and develop new resources that support new research scholarship on LA and also encourag[ing] the preservation, conservation, and display of local material culture".[9]
In collaboration with local organizations, GRI published Cultural Inheritance/L.A.: A Resource Directory of Less Visible Archives and Collections in the Los Angeles Region in 1999.[10] In 2000, the L.A. as Subject project was transferred to the University of Southern California, which continues to update and expand an online version of the resource directory.[11]
When the Getty Information Institute (formerly the Art History Information Program, established in 1983) was dissolved in 1999 as a "result of a change of leadership at the Getty Trust",[12] GRI absorbed "many of its functions".[13][14]
In 2000, Thomas E. Crow was selected as GRI director to replace Settis who had resigned in 1999.[15] Crow announced in October 2006 that he would be leaving for New York University.[16] Since November 2007 Thomas W. Gaehtgens has been GRI's director;[17] he was previously (1985–86) a visiting scholar with the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities.[5][16]

Library[edit]




Inside the Getty Research Institute Library


Among other holdings, GRI's research library contains over 1 million volumes of books, periodicals, and auction catalogs; special collections; and two million photographs of art and architecture.[18]
Already by 1985, the Getty had acquired the complete archive of the American sculptor Malvina Hoffman. In 2011, it acquired Harald Szeemann’s substantial archive, consisting of more than 1,000 boxes of correspondence, research files, drawings, and ephemera, as well as some 28,000 books and 36,000 photographs.[19] It also owns several art dealers' archives, including records for the Goupil & Cie and Boussod Valadon galleries, Knoedler Gallery, and the Duveen Brothers.[20]
The library is located at the Getty Center, and does not circulate its collections, but does extend library privileges to any visitor.[21]
Exhibitions and other events[edit]
GRI holds two public exhibitions per year in its two galleries which "focus primarily on the special collections of the Research Library or on work produced by artists in residence".[22] For example, in 2005–2006 GRI held an exhibition entitled "Julius Shulman, Modernity and the Metropolis".[23] The exhibition traveled to the National Building Museum[24] and to the Art Institute of Chicago.[25]
In addition to exhibitions, GRI organizes lectures (open to the public), colloquia (most open to the public), workshops (by invitation only), and screenings of films and videos (open to the public).[26]
Residential scholars program[edit]
The residential scholars program seeks to "integrate the often isolated territory of art history into the wider sphere of the humanities".[5] The first class of scholars arrived in 1985–1986; they had their salaries paid for and their housing provided but were under "absolutely no obligation to produce".[5] Among the notable scholars was German writer Christa Wolf in 1993–1994, who wrote the novel Medea: a modern retelling during her year at GRI.[27][28][29]
Each year the scholars are invited to work on projects related to an annual theme.[30] In 2008–2009, the theme for the Getty Center was "Networks and Boundaries" and for the Getty Villa "The Power and Function of Ancient Images".[30] The lengths of stay vary: Getty scholars are in residence for three, six or nine months,[31] visiting scholars for one to three months,[32] and predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows for a nine-month academic year.[33] In 2011–12, the theme was "Artistic Practice".[34]
Publications[edit]
GRI publishes "Series Imprints" books in the categories of "Issues and Debates", "Texts & Documents", "Introduction To" (on "cultural heritage information in electronic form"), and "ReSources" (on the library's special collections).[35] In addition, GRI publishes exhibition catalogs and other materials in hardcopy form.[35]
Here are selected books published by GRI, by the Getty Research Institute for the History of Art and the Humanities, by the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, by the Getty Information Institute, or by the Art History Information Program.

Electronic databases[edit]
Among the electronic databases from the former Getty Information Institute that GRI continues to produce are:

Getty Vocabulary Program databases (Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), and Union List of Artist Names (ULAN))[36]
Bibliography of the History of Art[37]
Getty Provenance Index which holds records of collections, auction sales and other information for researching the art market and the provenance of works.[38]
The Getty Research Portal provides free access to fully digitized art history texts in the public domain. The database launched in 2012 and is a collaboration with libraries that are digitizing art history books. Initial contributors include the Avery Architectural & Fine Arts Library at Columbia University, the Biblioteca de la Universidad de Málaga, the Frick Art Reference Library, the Getty Research Institute, the Heidelberg University Library, the Institut national d'histoire de l'art, members of the New York Art Resources Consortium, and the Thomas J. Watson Library at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[39]

In 2006, GRI and the OCLC Online Computer Library Center announced that the Getty Vocabularies (Art & Architecture Thesaurus, Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names, and Union List of Artist Names) will be available as a Web service.[40]
Until July 1, 2009, the Getty Information Institute and later GRI co-produced the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals with the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library. On that date, GRI transferred the database back to Columbia University, which continues to maintain it.[41]
The Getty Research Institute also participates in the German/American Provenance Research Exchange Program (PREP), which trains researchers specializing in Holocaust-era provenance projects.[42]

GRI's senior staff includes:[43]
