This is a list of properties and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland. There are approximately 1,500 listed sites in Maryland.

This National Park Service list is complete through NPS recent listings posted December 22, 2017.[1]



Current listings by county[edit]
The following are approximate tallies of current listings in Maryland on the National Register of Historic Places. These counts are based on entries in the National Register Information Database as of April 24, 2008,[2] and new weekly listings posted since then on the National Register of Historic Places web site.[3] There are frequent additions to the listings and occasional delistings, and the counts here are not official. Also, the counts in this table exclude boundary increase and decrease listings which modify the area covered by an existing property or district and which carry a separate National Register reference number.
