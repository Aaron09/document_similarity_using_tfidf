Road
From
To
Notes


 A4 road
City of London (Holborn Circus)
Avonmouth
Originally London to Bath


 A40 road
City of London (near St. Paul's Cathedral)
Fishguard
The longest A road in Zone 4 at 256 miles long


 A41 road
Central London (near Marble Arch)
Birkenhead
A large section of the former A41, from Bicester to Solihull, was downgraded when the northern extension of the M40 motorway was opened, as was a section in Birmingham due to other road improvements; most of it is now the non-contiguous B4100.


 A42 road
Kegworth
Appleby Magna
A continuation of the M42, hence the use of A42 despite being entirely in Zone 5. Early road atlases show the A42 running along the present A4074 and A34 from Reading to Birmingham.


 A43 road
M40 motorway Junction 10 north of Bicester
Stamford

Most of the section betweens Evesham and Leicester replaced by new-build sections, as well as the M69 motorway between Coventry and Leicester. The section from Cheltenham to Heath End (North of Stratford on Avon) was mostly reclassified as B4632 and much of what was previously the A435 from Cheltenham to Bidford was renamed the A46. A piece of A438 from M5 J9 to Toddington also became part of the A46, and the current section of the A46 round Stratford was new build.


 A47 road
Leicester
Great Yarmouth
The section between Birmingham and Nuneaton has been now de-classified to B-roads, while the section between Nuneaton and Leicester via Hinckley has been largely de-trunked since the M69 runs a similar route.
