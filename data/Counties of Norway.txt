Norway is divided into 18 administrative regions, called counties (singular Norwegian: fylke, plural Norwegian: fylker (Bokmål) / fylke (Nynorsk) from Old Norse: fylki from the word "folk"); until 1918, they were known as amter. The counties form the first-level subdivisions of Norway and are further divided into 422 municipalities (kommune, pl. kommuner / kommunar). The island territories of Svalbard and Jan Mayen are outside the county division and ruled directly at the national level. The capital Oslo is considered both a county and a municipality.
In 2017 the government decided to abolish the current counties and to replace them with fewer, larger administrative regions (regioner).[1]

List of counties[edit]
Below is a list of the Norwegian counties, with their current administrative centres. Note that the counties are administered both by appointees of the national government and to a lesser extent by their own elected bodies. The county numbers are from the official numbering system ISO 3166-2:NO, which originally was set up to follow the coastline from the Swedish border in the southeast to the Russian border in the northeast, but with the numbering has changed with county mergers. The number 13, 16, and 17 were dropped and the number 50 was added to account for changes over the years. (There is no connection between the lack of a county number 13 and the belief that 13 is an unlucky number.)

Map[edit]

Responsibilities and significance[edit]
Every county has two main organisations, both with underlying organisations.

The county municipality (no: Fylkeskommune) has a county council (Norwegian: Fylkesting), whose members are elected by the inhabitants. The county municipality is responsible mainly for some medium level schools, public transport organisation, regional road planning, culture and some more areas.
The county governor (no: Fylkesmannen) is an authority directly overseen by the Norwegian government. It surveills the municipalities and receive complaints from people over their actions. It also controls areas where the government needs local direct ruling outside the municipalities.

History[edit]
Fylke (1st period)[edit]
From the consolidation to a single kingdom, Norway was divided into a number of geographic regions that had its own legislative assembly or Thing, such as Gulating (Western Norway) and Frostating (Trøndelag). The second-order subdivision of these regions was into fylker, such as Egdafylke and Hordafylke. In 1914, the historical term fylke was brought into use again to replace the term amt introduced during the union with Denmark. Current day counties (fylker) often, but not necessarily, correspond to the historical areas.

Syssel[edit]
Syssel in 1300[edit]
From the end of the 12th century, Norway was divided into several syssel. The head of the various syssel was the syslemann, who represented the king locally. The following shows a reconstruction of the different syssel in Norway c. 1300, including sub-syssel where these seem established.[4]

Len[edit]
From 1308, the term len (plural len) in Norway signified an administrative region roughly equivalent to today's counties. The historic len was an important administrative entity during the period of Dano-Norwegian unification after their amalgamation as one state, which lasted for the period 1536[5]–1814.
At the beginning of the 16th century the political divisions were variable, but consistently included four main len and approximately 30 smaller sub-regions with varying connections to a main len. Up to 1660 the four principal len were headquartered at the major fortresses Bohus Fortress, Akershus Fortress, Bergenhus Fortress and the fortified city of Trondheim.[6] The sub-regions corresponded to the church districts for the Lutheran church in Norway.
Len in 1536[edit]

Båhus len (later termed Bohuslän after Denmark-Norway ceded it to Sweden by the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658)
Akershus len
Trondheim len
Bergenhus len (which included Northern Norway)

These four principal len were in the 1530s divided into approximately 30 smaller regions. From that point forward through the beginning of the 17th century the number of subsidiary len was reduced, while the composition of the principal len became more stable.[7]
Len in 1660[edit]
From 1660 Norway had nine principal len comprising 17 subsidiary len:




Akershus len
Tunsberg len
Bratsberg len
Agdesiden len
Stavanger len





Bergenhus len
Trondheim len
Nordlandene len
Vardøhus len




Len written as län continues to be used as the administrative equivalent of county in Sweden to this day. Each len was governed by a lenman.[8]
Amt[edit]
With the royal decree of February 19, 1662, each len was designated an amt (plural amt) and the lenmann was titled amtmann, from German Amt (office), reflecting the bias of the Danish court of that period.[9]
Amt in 1671[edit]
After 1671 Norway was divided into four principal amt or stiftsamt and there were nine subordinate amt:




Akershus amt

Smålenene amt
Brunla amt


Agdesiden amt

Bratsberg amt
Stavanger amt







Bergenhus amt

Halsnøy klostergods
Hardanger amt
Nordlandene amt


Trondheim amt

Romsdalen amt
Vardøhus amt






Amt in 1730[edit]
From 1730 Norway had the following amt:




Vardøhus amt
Tromsø amt
Nordlands amt
Nordre Trondhjems amt
Søndre Trondhjems amt
Romsdalen amt
Nordre Bergenhus amt
Søndre Bergenhus amt
Stavanger amt





Lister og Mandals amt
Nedenes amt
Bratsberg amt
Buskerud amt
Oplandenes amt
Hedemarkens amt
Akershus amt
Smaalenenes amt




At this time there were also two counties (grevskap) controlled by actual counts, together forming what is now Vestfold county:

Laurvigen county
Jarlsberg county

Amt in 1760[edit]
In 1760 Norway had the following stiftamt and amt:[10]




Akershus stiftamt

Opplands amt
Akershus amt
Smålenenes amt
Laurvigen county
Jarlsberg county
Bratsberg amt (eastern half)







Agdesiden stiftamt

Bratsberg amt (western half)
Nedenes amt
Lister and Mandal amt
Stavanger amt







Bergenhus stiftamt

Romsdal amt (southern half)


Trondheim stiftamt

Romsdal amt (northern half)
Nordlands amt
Vardøhus amt






Fylke (2nd period)[edit]
From 1919 each amt was renamed a fylke (plural fylker) (county) and the amtmann was now titled fylkesmann (county governor).




Østfold fylke
Akershus fylke
Oslo fylke
Hedmark fylke
Oppland fylke
Buskerud fylke
Vestfold fylke
Telemark fylke
Aust-Agder fylke





Vest-Agder fylke

Møre og Romsdal fylke
Sør-Trøndelag fylke (Merged to Trøndelag fylke in 2018)





Nord-Trøndelag fylke (Merged to Trøndelag fylke in 2018)
Trøndelag fylke (Created in 2018)[11]
Nordland fylke
Troms fylke
Finnmark fylke




Region[edit]
Main articles: no:Regionreformen i Norge and no:Regioner i Norge
See also: no:Kommunereformen i Norge
In 2017 the Norwegian government announced the merge of the existing 19 fylker into 11 regions by 2020 (and Trøndelag by 2018). Each region (plural regioner) would be led by a regionleder (region leader), which would be equivalent to the current position of fylkesmann.[12]
