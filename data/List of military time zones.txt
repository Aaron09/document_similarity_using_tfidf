This is a list of military time zones as defined in the ACP 121(I) standard.[1] It is used by the U.S. military, as well as the other members Combined Communications Electronics Board. The names are identical to the NATO phonetic alphabet, but with "A" spelled as "Alfa", instead of NATO's "Alpha".
Going east from the prime meridian at Greenwich, letters "Alfa" through to "Mike" (skipping "J", see below) are used for the 12 time zones with positive GMT offsets until reaching the international Date Line. Going west from Greenwich, letters "November" through to "Yankee" are used for zones with negative offsets.
The system apparently originates from Nathaniel Bowditch's 1802 American Practical Navigator book,[citation needed] where time zones were labelled with letters and "J" was skipped[2] to avoid confusion with "I"[citation needed] and because some alphabets don't have one,[citation needed] such as Cyrillic.[citation needed]
The letter "J" ("Juliet"), originally skipped, may now be used to indicate the observer's local time.[3] Such practice is not standardized, though. Letter "L" is commonly mistaken for "local".[4]
The letter "Z" ("Zulu") indicates the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
They are used in conjunction with military time: for instance, 6:00 a.m. in zone GMT−5 is written "0600R" and spoken "zero six hundred Romeo".
