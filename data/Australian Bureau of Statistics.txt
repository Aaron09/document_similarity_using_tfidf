History[edit]
In 1901, statistics were collected by each state for their individual use. While attempts were made to coordinate collections through an annual Conference of Statisticians, it was quickly realised that a National Statistical Office would be required to develop nationally comparable statistics.[4]
The Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics (CBCS) was established under the Census and Statistics Act in 1905. Sir George Knibbs was appointed as the first Commonwealth Statistician. Initially, the Bureau was located in Melbourne and was attached to the Department of Home Affairs. In 1928, the Bureau was relocated to Canberra and in 1932, it moved to the Treasury portfolio.[4]
Initially, the states maintained their own statistical offices and worked together with the CBCS to produce national data. However, some states found it difficult to resource a state statistical office to the level required for an adequate statistical service. In 1924, the Tasmanian Statistical Office transferred to the Commonwealth. Unification of the state statistical offices with the CBCS was finally achieved in the late 1950s under the stewardship of Sir Stanley Carver, who was both NSW Statistician and Acting Commonwealth Statistician.[4]
In 1974, the CBCS was abolished and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) was established in its place. The Australian Bureau of Statistics Act in 1975, established the ABS as a statutory authority headed by the Australian Statistician and responsible to the Treasurer.[4]
Organisational vision and values[edit]
The ABS purpose is to "inform Australia's important decisions by partnering and innovating to deliver relevant, trusted, objective data, statistics and insights".[5]
The ABS values work in conjunction with the broader Australian Public Service (APS) values[6] and include Impartiality, Commitment to Service, Accountability, Respect and Ethical Behaviour.[7]
Modernisation[edit]
From 2015 an investment of $250 million over five years by the Australian Government[7] is being used to modernise ABS systems and processes, with the aim of delivering the best possible statistical program in more efficient and innovative ways.[7]
Census of population and housing[edit]
The ABS undertakes the Australian Census of population and housing. The Census is conducted every five years under the authority of the federal Census and Statistics Act 1905.[8]
The last Australian Census was held on 9 August 2016. This was Australia's 17th national census.
The census of population and housing is the largest statistical collection undertaken by the ABS and one of the most important. The census aims to accurately measure the number of people and dwellings in Australia on census night, and a range of their key characteristics. This information is used to inform public policy as well as electoral boundaries, infrastructure planning and the provision of community services. Users of Census data include government, the media, not for profit organisations, researchers and academics, among others.
Results from the 2016 census were available on the ABS website from 27 June 2017.[9]
2016 Census[edit]
Main article: 2016 Australian census
A move was undertaken by the ABS to largely implement the Census online through their website and logins rather than through traditional paper forms.[10] The 2016 census was unavailable for 43 hours from 7.30 pm on 9 August due to a series of events which prompted the ABS to take the form offline.[11] The Chief Statistician, David Kalisch, said the website was closed after multiple internet (distributed) denial-of-service attacks targeted the online form. The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) confirmed the incident was a DDoS attack and that it did not result in any unauthorised access to, or extraction of, any personal information.[12][13]
The online census webpage was back up at 2:30 pm on 11 August.[14] A Senate Inquiry was held into the Census events.[15] An independent panel established by the Australian Statistician to quality assure the data from the 2016 Census found it was fit for purpose, comparable to previous Australian and international censuses and can be used with confidence.[16]
Work program[edit]
The ABS has an extensive work program covering a vast range of topics, and releases several hundred publications yearly. Topics include:

Economy
Industry
People
Labour
Health
Environment
Snapshots of Australia.

Main economic indicators[edit]
The ABS publishes a suite of monthly and quarterly economic publications that are part of the core of the organisation's work program. These statistics are integral to the functioning of Australia's economy and impact areas such as interest rates, property prices, employment, the value of the Australian dollar, commodity prices and many more areas. Popular publications include:

Key Economic Indicators
Consumer Price Index
Australian National Accounts
Average Weekly Earnings
Labour Force

Other major publications Outside the main economic indicators, the ABS has a number of other major publications covering diverse topics including:

Health: The 2011–12 Australian Health Survey was the most comprehensive survey on health and wellbeing ever conducted in Australia. For the first time, the survey also included a biomedical component with respondents having the option of providing biomedical samples such as blood and urine for testing. This allowed the survey to capture detailed health information from Australians such as the prevalence of conditions such as diabetes in the community. Many individuals were subsequently informed that they had medical conditions they were not aware of prior to testing.[17] Another component of the Australian Health Survey asked respondents to keep a food diary which was then used to obtain a rich picture of the nutritional intake and dietary preferences of the nation.[18]
Crime: The ABS publishes a suite of crime publications including individual releases covering offenders,[19] crime victims,[20] the corrections system[21] and prisons.[22]
Demography: The ABS publishes a number of demography releases including data on population,[23] population growth[24] and projections,[25] interstate and overseas migration,[26] births,[27] deaths[28] and overseas arrivals and departures.[29]
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander statistics: The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS) collects information on the social situation of Indigenous Australians including on health, education, culture and labour force participation. The ABS also collects data related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders through the Australian Health Survey[30] as well as in many other regular publications in the areas of demography, education, employment and more.
Education: The major education publications are Childhood Education and Care,[31] Schools,[32] and Education and Work.[33] They look at all aspects of education in Australia from preschool up to undergraduate and postgraduate study.
Environment: The ABS has a comprehensive range of publications on environmental topics covering energy and water use, conservation activities undertaken by households, land management and farming and more. The innovative Land Account publication covering the Great Barrier Reef and utilising Google Maps technology was released in 2011.[34]
Research and Innovation: The ABS has been undertaking surveys to collect estimates from Australian organisations regarding expenditure on and human resources devoted to research and development (R&D) in Australia since 1978. The results allow the nature and distribution of Australia's R&D activity to be monitored by government policy analysts and advisers to government, businesses and economists.[35]

In August 2017 the Treasurer issued a direction to the ABS to undertake a statistical collection in to the views of Australians on the electoral roll about same sex marriage.[36] This is now referred to as the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey.
International engagement[edit]

International engagement is important to the ABS for a number of reasons. The ABS shapes, influences and leads the development of international statistical standards in order to enhance Australia's international comparability, and improve the utility of international statistics for Australian decision makers across economic, environmental, population and social statistics. ABS international engagement helps make the global statistical picture more reliable and useful for Australia and its region. These enhanced international statistics inform the full spectrum of Australian policy making.[37]
During 2013–14, the ABS continued its focus on building capability in Asia and the Pacific region and leading work in statistical standards and methodology within the global statistical community. ABS executive and senior personnel chaired and actively participated in key international committees and working groups, providing leadership, influencing global standards and assisting regional outcomes.[37]
The ABS also continued its partnership with AusAID to deliver statistical programs for Indonesia and the Pacific region through leadership and technical capability building programs both in country, and by hosting development visits. Over this period, the ABS also hosted international development and study visits from a range of countries including China, Thailand, Canada, Samoa and Singapore.[37]
Australian Statistician[edit]
Main article: Australian Statistician
Since 1975, the head of the ABS has been known as the Australian Statistician. Previously, the office was titled the Commonwealth Statistician.
The incumbent since 15 December 2014 is David Kalisch.[2] The previous incumbent (since March 2007) was Brian Pink.[38] Pink retired in January 2014.[3] Ian Ewing acted in the role from 13 January to 14 February 2014, and Jonathan Palmer acted from 17 February to 12 December 2014.
Social media and multimedia[edit]
The ABS maintains a social media presence on Facebook, Twitter and Google+ with the aim of increasing the accessibility of official statistics while engaging with the Australian community. The organisation also has a number of other online initiatives, outlined below.
Run That Town iPhone app[edit]
Run That Town is a strategy game that uses real ABS data to illustrate the practical application of statistics to decision making within the community. Since May 2013, it has been downloaded over 70,000 times and has won numerous awards including in the Australian Mobile Awards, Epica Awards, Favourite Website Awards and the Interactive Advertising Bureau Awards.[39] It is available for free download from the Apple App store.
ABS Statistics app[edit]
Available for free download on iOS and Android devices, the ABS mobile application features Key Economic Indicators, a Population Clock, and the ability to compare 2011 Census data for postal areas

Divisions.

Census Spotlight[edit]
Spotlight is an interactive application on the ABS website that takes some of the data from the 2011 census and turns it into an interactive movie to show the interesting things that the census captures about Australia's people and population. Spotlight can be used to create a personal infographic that can be shared with friends.
Other interactive features[edit]
Other interactive innovations from the ABS include the animated Population Pyramid – Australia showing change in the population distribution over time and the Consumer Price Index Inflation Calculator which shows the purchasing power of an amount of money between two chosen dates.
