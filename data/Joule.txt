The joule (/dʒuːl/); symbol: J), is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units.[1] It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N⋅m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818–1889).[2][3][4]

where kg is the kilogram, m is the metre, s is the second, N is the newton, Pa is the pascal, W is the watt, C is the coulomb, and V is the volt.
One joule can also be defined as:

The work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt, or one "coulomb-volt" (C⋅V). This relationship can be used to define the volt.
The work required to produce one watt of power for one second, or one "watt-second" (W⋅s) (compare kilowatt-hour –  3.6 megajoules). This relationship can be used to define the watt.

Usage[edit]
This SI unit is named after James Prescott Joule. As with every International System of Units (SI) unit named for a person, the first letter of its symbol is upper case (J). However, when an SI unit is spelled out in English, it should always begin with a lower case letter (joule)—except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized, such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case. Note that "degree Celsius" conforms to this rule because the "d" is lowercase.— Based on The International System of Units, section 5.2.
Confusion with newton metre[edit]
Main article: newton metre
In mechanics, the concept of force (in some direction) has a close analog in the concept of torque (about some angle):


Linear
Angular


force
torque


mass
moment of inertia


distance
angle


A result of this similarity is that the SI unit for torque is the newton metre, which works out algebraically to have the same dimensions as the Joule. But they are not interchangeable. The CGPM has given the unit of energy the name Joule, but has not given the unit of torque any special name, hence it is simply the newton metre (N⋅m) – a compound name derived from its constituent parts.[5] The use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications.[5]
The distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar – the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement. By contrast, torque is a vector – the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector. Torque and energy are related to one another by the equation





E
=
τ
θ
 
,


{\displaystyle E=\tau \theta \ ,}



where E is energy, τ is (the vector magnitude of) torque, and θ is the angle swept (in radians). Since radians are dimensionless, it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions.
Practical examples[edit]
One joule in everyday life represents approximately:

The energy required to lift a medium-size tomato (100 g) 1 m vertically from the surface of the Earth.[6]
The energy released when that same tomato falls back down to the ground.
The energy required to accelerate a 1 kg mass at 1 m⋅s−2 through a distance of 1 m.
The heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 0.24 °C.[7]
The typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1/60 s (approximately 17 ms).[8]
The kinetic energy of a 50 kg human moving very slowly (0.2 m/s or 0.72 km/h).
The kinetic energy of a 56 g tennis ball moving at 6 m/s (22 km/h).[9]
The kinetic energy of an object with mass 1 kg moving at √2 ≈ 1.4 m/s.
The amount of electricity required to light a 1 W LED for 1 s.

Since the joule is also a watt-second and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kW⋅h (kilowatt-hour), a kW⋅h is thus 1000 W × 3600 s = 3.6 MJ (megajoules).

Zeptojoule[edit]
The zeptojoule (zJ) is equal to one sextillionth (10−21) of one joule. 160 zeptojoules is about one electronvolt.
Nanojoule[edit]
The nanojoule (nJ) is equal to one billionth (10−9) of one joule. 160 nanojoules is about the kinetic energy of a flying mosquito.[10]
Microjoule[edit]
The microjoule (μJ) is equal to one millionth (10−6) of one joule. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) produces collisions of the microjoule order (7 TeV) per particle.
Millijoule[edit]
The millijoule (mJ) is equal to one thousandth (10−3) of a joule.
Kilojoule[edit]
The kilojoule (kJ) is equal to one thousand (103) joules. Nutritional food labels in most countries express energy in kilojoules (kJ).[11]
One square metre of the Earth receives about 1.4 kilojoules of solar radiation every second in full daylight.[12]
Megajoule[edit]
The megajoule (MJ) is equal to one million (106) joules, or approximately the kinetic energy of a one megagram (tonne) vehicle moving at 161 km/h.
The energy required to heat 10 liters of liquid water at constant pressure from 0 °C (32 °F) to 100 °C (212 °F) is approximately 4.2 MJ.
One kilowatt hour of electricity is 3.6 megajoules.
Gigajoule[edit]
The gigajoule (GJ) is equal to one billion (109) joules. 6 GJ is about the chemical energy of combusting 1 barrel (159 l) of crude oil.[13] 2 GJ is about the Planck energy unit.
Terajoule[edit]
The terajoule (TJ) is equal to one trillion (1012) joules; or about 0.278 GWh (which is often used in energy tables). About 63 TJ of energy was released by the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima.[14] The International Space Station, with a mass of approximately 450 megagrams and orbital velocity of 7.7 km/s,[15] has a kinetic energy of roughly 13 TJ. In 2017 Hurricane Irma was estimated to have a peak wind energy of 112 TJ.[16][17]
Petajoule[edit]
The petajoule (PJ) is equal to one quadrillion (1015) joules. 210 PJ is about 50 megatons of TNT. This is the amount of energy released by the Tsar Bomba, the largest man-made explosion ever.
Exajoule[edit]
The exajoule (EJ) is equal to 1018 (one quintillion) joules. The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan had 1.41 EJ of energy according to its rating of 9.0 on the moment magnitude scale. Yearly U.S. energy consumption amounts to roughly 94 EJ.
Zettajoule[edit]
The zettajoule (ZJ) is equal to one sextillion (1021) joules. The human annual global energy consumption is approximately 0.5 ZJ.
Yottajoule[edit]
The yottajoule (YJ) is equal to one septillion (1024) joules. This is approximately the amount of energy required to heat all the water on Earth by 1 °C. The thermal output of the Sun is approximately 400 YJ per second.

Joule, for example, may formally be written newton metre, or kilogram metre squared per second squared. This, however, is an algebraic freedom to be governed by common sense physical considerations; in a given situation some forms may be more helpful than others.
