Geography[edit]




Torre Sant'Andrea, Salento


Puglia's coastline is longer than that of any other mainland Italian region. In the north, the Gargano promontory extends out into the Adriatic while in the south, the dry Salento area forms the 'tacco' of Italy's boot. [3]
It is home to two national parks, the Alta Murgia National Park and Gargano National Park.[4]

History[edit]




Castel del Monte, built by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II between 1240 and 1250 in Andria






The medieval town of Ostuni


Apulia is one of the richest archaeological regions in Italy. It was first colonized by Mycenaean Greeks.[5]
A number of castles were built in the area by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, including Castel del Monte,[6] sometimes called the "Crown of Apulia".[7]
After 1282, when the island of Sicily was lost, Apulia was part of the Kingdom of Naples (confusingly known also as the Kingdom of Sicily), and remained so until the unification of Italy in the 1860s. This kingdom was independent under the House of Anjou from 1282 to 1442, then was part of Aragon until 1458, after which it was again independent under a cadet branch of the House of Trastámara until 1501. As a result of the French–Spanish war of 1501–1504, Naples again came under the rule of Aragon and the Spanish Empire from 1504 to 1714. When Barbary pirates of North Africa sacked Vieste in 1554, they took an estimated 7,000 slaves.[8] The coast of Apulia was occupied at times by the Turks and at other times by the Venetians.[9]
In 1861 the region became part of the Kingdom of Italy, with the new capital city at Turin. In the words of one historian, Turin was "so far away that Otranto is today closer to seventeen foreign capitals than it is to Turin".[10]
Economy[edit]
The region's contribution to Italy's gross value added was around 4.6% in 2000, while its population was 7% of the total. The per capita GDP is low compared to the national average and represents about 68.1% of the EU average.[11]
The share of gross value added by the agricultural and services sectors was above the national average in 2000. The region has industries specialising in particular areas, including food processing and vehicles in Foggia; footwear and textiles in the Barletta area, and wood and furniture in the Murge area to the west.[12]
Between 2007 and 2013 the economy of Apulia expanded more than that of the rest of southern Italy.[13] Such growth, over several decades, is a severe challenge to the hydrogeological system.[14]
Transport[edit]
The region has a good network of roads, but the railway network is less comprehensive, particularly in the south.[12]< The region is crossed northwest to southeast by the A14 highway (Bologna–Taranto), which connects the region capital, Bari, to Taranto, the second most populous city in the region. The A14 also connects Foggia and points further north along the Adriatic coast to Pescara, Ancona, Rimini and eventually, Bologna. The only other highway in the region is the A16 (Napoli–Canosa), which crosses the Italian peninsula east–west and links the region with Napoli.
There are two international airports in the region, Karol Wojtyla Airport in Bari and Brindisi Airport in Brindisi.

Emigration from the region's depressed areas to northern Italy and the rest of Europe was very intense in the years between 1956 and 1971. Subsequently, the trend declined as economic conditions improved, to the point where there was net immigration in the years between 1982 and 1985. Since 1986 the stagnation in employment has led to a new inversion of the trend, caused by a decrease in immigration.[15]
Government and politics[edit]
Main article: Politics of Apulia
Since 1 June 2015, former judge and mayor of Bari Michele Emiliano of the Democratic Party has served as President.[16][17]
Culture[edit]
Cuisine[edit]
Cuisine plays an important role throughout Apulia. The key locally produced ingredients used there include olive oil, artichokes, tomatoes, aubergine, asparagus, and mushrooms.[18]
Language[edit]
As with the other regions of Italy, the national language (since 1861) is Italian. However, because of its long and varied history, other historical languages have been spoken in this region for centuries.[citation needed]
In isolated pockets of the southern part of Salento, a dialect of modern Greek called Griko is spoken by a few thousand people.[19] In addition, rare dialects of the Franco-Provençal language called Faetar and the closely related Cellese are spoken by a dwindling number of individuals in the towns of Faeto and Celle Di San Vito, in the Province of Foggia.[20] The Arbëreshë dialect of the Albanian language has been spoken by a small community since refugees settled there in the 15th century.[21]
