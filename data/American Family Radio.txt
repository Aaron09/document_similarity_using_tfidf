American Family Radio (AFR) is a network of more than 160 radio stations broadcasting Christian-oriented programming to over 40 states. AFR is also available to both watch and listen worldwide on their website.
Overview[edit]
AFR was launched by Rev. Donald Wildmon in 1991 as a ministry of the American Family Association, with the flagship station being WAFR in Tupelo, Mississippi. It is split between three networks--"AFR Talk," which airs mostly conservative-leaning Christian talk and teaching; "AFR Music," which airs contemporary Christian music 24 hours a day; and "Urban Family Talk," which airs programming aimed at black conservatives.
AFR airs original programs such as Today's Issues, hosted by AFA president Tim Wildmon, AFA Report, "a daily panel discussion with members of the AFA staff regarding hot-button issues of the day", formerly hosted by AFA founder Don Wildmon and Focal Point, hosted by Bryan Fischer. AFR also airs nationally syndicated programs such as Focus on the Family, as well as contemporary Christian music by various artists.
In 2009, AFR acquired the rights to its first politically oriented talk show when it picked up Michael Reagan's syndicated program (this show is no longer available on AFR as of Spring 2010).
