Saint Martin (French: Saint-Martin), officially the Collectivity of Saint Martin (Collectivité de Saint-Martin) is an overseas collectivity of France in the Caribbean. With a population of 36,286 (as of January 2011)[2] on an area of 53.2 square kilometres (20.5 sq mi), it encompasses the northern 60% of the divided island of Saint Martin, and some neighbouring islets, the largest of which is Île Tintamarre. The southern 40% of the island of Saint Martin constitutes Sint Maarten, since 2010 a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
Before 2007, the French part of Saint Martin formed a part of the French overseas région and département of Guadeloupe. Saint Martin is separated from the island of Anguilla by the Anguilla Channel. Its capital is Marigot.
Hurricane Irma hit the island on 6–7 September 2017 with Category 5 winds which caused widespread and significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. [3] [4] As of 10 September, reports indicated that ten deaths were attributed to the storm on this island and on Saint Barthelemy (combined) and that seven people were still missing.[5]

Politics and government[edit]
Saint Martin was for many years a French commune, forming part of Guadeloupe, which is an overseas région and département of France. In 2003 the population of the French part of the island voted in favour of secession from Guadeloupe in order to form a separate overseas collectivity (COM) of France.[6] On 9 February 2007, the French Parliament passed a bill granting COM status to both the French part of Saint Martin and (separately) the neighbouring Saint Barthélemy.[7] The new status took effect on 15 July 2007, once the local assemblies were elected,[8] with the second leg of the vote ultimately occurring on 15 July 2007.[9] Saint Martin remains part of the European Union.[10]
The new governance structure befitting an overseas collectivity took effect on 15 July 2007 with the first session of the Territorial Council (French: Conseil territorial) and the election of Louis-Constant Fleming as president of the Territorial Council. On 25 July 2008 Fleming resigned after being sanctioned by the Conseil d'État for one year over problems with his 2007 election campaign.[11] On 7 August, Frantz Gumbs was elected as President of the Territorial Council.[12] However, his election was declared invalid on 10 April 2009 and Daniel Gibbs appointed as Acting President of the Territorial Council on 14 April 2009.[13] Gumbs was reelected on 5 May 2009.[14]
Before 2007, Saint Martin was coded as GP (Guadeloupe) in ISO 3166-1. In October 2007, it received the ISO 3166-1 code MF (alpha-2 code), MAF (alpha-3 code), and 663 (numeric code).[15]

Coat of arms[edit]
The coat of arms of the French overseas collectivity Saint-Martin features a ship, a palm and a sun, and reads "Collectivité de Saint Martin".[16] The commune that existed until 22 February 2007, used similar arms but with the legend "Ville de Saint Martin".[17][18]
Demographics[edit]
The French part of the island has a land area of 53.2 square kilometres (20.5 sq mi). A local English-based dialect is spoken in informal situations on both the French and Dutch sides of the island.[19] At the January 2011 French census, the population in the French part of the island was 36,286[2] (up from only 8,072 inhabitants at the 1982 census), which means a population density of 682 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,770/sq mi) in 2011.
During the 1980s, the population more than tripled; at the time, the collectivity was administered as a part of Guadeloupe.

Economy[edit]
Main article: Economy of Saint Martin




Flags flying in Marigot harbour, Saint-Martin.


The official currency of Saint Martin is the euro, though the US dollar is also widely accepted. Tourism is the main economic activity.
INSEE estimated that the total GDP of Saint Martin amounted to 421 million euros in 1999 (US$449 million at 1999 exchanges rates; US$599 million at Oct. 2007 exchange rates).[20] In that same year the GDP per capita of Saint Martin was 14,500 euros (US$15,500 at 1999 exchanges rates; US$20,600 at Oct. 2007 exchange rates), which was 39% lower than the average GDP per capita of metropolitan France in 1999.[20] In comparison, the GDP per capita on the Dutch side of the island, Sint Maarten, was 14,430 euros in 2004.[21]
Education[edit]
The collectivity has seven public preschools (maternelles) and seven public elementary schools:[22]

Preschools: Emile Choisy, Nina Duverly, Eli Gibs, Quartier d'Orléans 1, Sandy Ground, Hervé Williams 1, Hervé Williams 2
Elementary schools: Grand Case, Eveline Halley, Morne O'Reilly, Quartier d'Orléans 1, Quartier d'Orléans 2, Sandy Ground, Simeone Trott

There are three junior high schools (collège) and one senior high school:[23]

Junior highs: #1 Des Accords, #2 Soualiaga, #3 Quartier d'Orleans
Lycée des Îles Nord (senior high/sixth-form)

Hurricane Irma[edit]
Hurricane Irma hit Saint Martin on 6 and 7 September, 2017. France's Minister of the Interior said on 8 September that most of the schools were destroyed. In addition to damage caused by high winds, there were reports of serious flood damage to businesses in the village of Marigot. Looting was also a serious problem. France sent aid as well as additional police and emergency personnel to the island.[24][25][26] 95% of the structures on the French side had been damaged or destroyed. [27] [28] Looting or "pillaging" was a problem initially; France was sending 240 gendarmes to help control the situation.[29]
On 10 September, France announced that it was sending additional emergency supplies, including water and electrical equipment to help restore the power supply, to St. Martin, as an early step to helping the residents to survive and later, to rebuild.[30] By 11 September, President Emmanuel Macron was flying to the area to view the damage and to assure residents of support for relief efforts.[31] At that time, only tourists and visitors from France (mainlanders) had been evacuated from St. Martin, leading to complaints by black and mixed-race residents that whites were being given priority.[32] Macron arrived on 12 September with emergency supplies and said that by the weekend "many things will be reopened".[33] He pledged 50 million euros of aid for the French islands and said the rebuilding will be done quickly but very well.[34]
