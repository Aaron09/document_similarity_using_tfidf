The Argentina national football team (Spanish: Selección de fútbol de Argentina) represents Argentina in football and is controlled by the Argentine Football Association (AFA), the governing body for football in Argentina. Argentina's home stadium is Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti in Buenos Aires.
La Selección (national team), also known as the Albicelestes , has appeared in five World Cup finals, including the first final in 1930, which they lost 4–2 to Uruguay. Argentina won in their next final appearance in 1978, beating the Netherlands at extra time, 3–1. Argentina, led by Diego Maradona won again in 1986, a 3–2 victory over West Germany. They again made the World Cup finals in 1990, and lost 1–0 to West Germany following a controversial penalty call in the 87th minute. Argentina, led by Lionel Messi made their fifth appearance in a World Cup final in 2014, again losing to Germany, 1–0 during extra-time. Argentina's World Cup winning managers are César Luis Menotti in 1978, and Carlos Bilardo in 1986.
Argentina has been very successful in the Copa América, winning it 14 times and also winning the 'extra' South American Championships in 1941, 1945 and 1946. The team also won the FIFA Confederations Cup and the Kirin Cup, both in 1992, and the Argentine olympic team won the Olympics football tournaments in Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008.[2]
Argentina, Brazil, Germany[note 2] and France are the only national teams that have won the three most important men's titles recognized by FIFA: the World Cup, the Confederations Cup, and the Olympic tournament. They have also won their respective continental championship (Copa América for Argentina and Brazil, and UEFA European Championship for Germany and France).[4][5]
Argentina is known for having rivalries with Brazil, Uruguay, England and Germany due to historic occurrences with one another throughout football history.[6][7]

History[edit]
Main article: History of the Argentina national football team
Further information: Football in Argentina
The first match ever recorded by Argentina was against Uruguay.[note 1] The game was held in Montevideo on 16 May 1901 and Argentina won 3–2. During the first years of its existence, the Argentina national team only played friendly matches against other South American teams. The reasons for this varied, including long travel times between countries and World War I.[10]
La Selección (national team), also known as the Albicelestes (sky blue and whites), has appeared in five World Cup finals, including the first final in 1930, which they lost, 4–2, to Uruguay. Argentina won in their next final in 1978, beating the Netherlands, 3–1. Argentina, led by Diego Maradona won again in 1986, a 3–2 victory over West Germany. Their most recent World Cup final was in 2014, which they lost 1–0 to Germany. Previous to this their last World Cup final was in 1990, which they lost, 1–0, to Germany by a much disputed penalty. Argentina's World Cup winning managers are César Luis Menotti in 1978, and Carlos Bilardo in 1986.
Argentina has been very successful in the Copa América, winning it 14 times and also winning the "extra" South American Championships in 1941, 1945 and 1946. The team also won the FIFA Confederations Cup and the Kirin Cup, both in 1992, and an Argentina team (with only three players of over 23 years of age included in the squad) won the Olympics football tournaments in Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008.[11]
Argentina also won six of the 14 football competitions at the Pan American Games, winning in 1951, 1955, 1959, 1971, 1995 and 2003.
In March 2007, Argentina reached the top of the FIFA World Rankings for the first time.[12]
Kit history[edit]
The first jersey wore by Argentina was a white one, when the national side officially debuted against Uruguay in 1902.[13] In September 1908, Argentina wore the white and light blue in vertical stripes jersey for the first time.[14] That kit would become the official kit since then. The away kits usually have been in dark blue tones, varying the colors of shorts and socks.
Nevertheless, Argentina wore other uniforms a few times. One of them was on 3 June 1919 in Rio de Janeiro playing the "Roberto Chery Cup" against Brazil. That time Argentina wore a light blue kit, similar to Uruguay.[15] The trophy was established by Brazilian Football Confederation for the benefit of Roberto Chery's relatives. Chery was Uruguay's substitute goalkeeper and died during the 1919 South American Championship after collapsing in a game against Chile.[16]
At the 1958 World Cup, Argentina wore Swedish club IFK Malmö's yellow jersey in the match against West Germany, as the team did not bring away uniforms to Sweden.[17]

Brazil[edit]
Main article: Argentina–Brazil football rivalry
Argentina have a long and fierce rivalry with their South American neighbours.[citation needed]
England[edit]
Main article: Argentina–England football rivalry
With a rivalry stemming from the 1966 World Cup and intensified by the Falklands War of 1982, Argentina and England have had numerous confrontations in World Cup tournaments. Perhaps the most notable was the quarter-final match in 1986, where Diego Maradona scored two goals against England.
Germany[edit]
Argentina have played Germany in three FIFA World Cup finals. In 1986 and 1990 the two teams played each other in two consecutive World Cup finals. After that, in 2006, Argentina lost on penalties after a 1–1 draw and lost again in 2010, this time with a 4–0 victory for Germany. They played each other for the third consecutive World Cup when they met at the 2014 World Cup final match, where they were defeated by Germany in extra time by a score of 1–0.
Uruguay[edit]
Argentina have a long-standing rivalry with their neighbors, that came into existence from the early South American Championships, the 1928 Summer Olympics and the first World Cup final, held in 1930.
Argentina and Uruguay hold the record for most international matches played between two countries.[1] The two teams have faced each other 198 times since 1901. The first match between Argentina and Uruguay was also the first official international match to be played outside the United Kingdom.[note 4]

^ Includes Olympic Gold won by East Germany in 1976.[3]
^ Although FIFA recognises two goals Batistuta scored in a 6–0 home win against the Slovakia national youth side on 22 June 1995, the Argentine Football Association does not recognise these goals.[26]
^ Although Canada and the United States played two internationals in 1885 and 1886, neither match is considered official; Canada did not play an official international until 1904 and the USA did not play one until 1916.[citation needed]
