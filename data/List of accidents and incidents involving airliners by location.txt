This list of accidents and incidents on airliners by location summarizes airline accidents by states location, airline company with flight number, date, and cause.
There are 380 listed at the last count, as of 1.11.2015, not including those on linked articles.
It is also available grouped

by year as List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft;
by airline;
by category.

Aviation Safety Network.

Airlines often seem to be remembered by their worst accidents and incidents. In that sense this list presents a good overview. While all the accidents and incidents in this list are noteworthy, not all involve fatalities.
If the aircraft crashed on land, it will be listed under a continent and a country. If the aircraft crashed on a body of water, it will be listed under that body of water (except if that body of water included in an area of a country). Accidents and incidents written in bold were the deadliest in that country.
