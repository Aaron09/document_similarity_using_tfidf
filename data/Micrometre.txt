The micrometre (International spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures;[1] SI symbol: μm) or micrometer (American spelling), also commonly known as a micron, is an SI derived unit of length equaling 6994100000000000000♠1×10−6 metre (SI standard prefix "micro-" = 10−6); that is, one millionth of a metre (or one thousandth of a millimetre, 0.001 mm, or about 0.000039 inch).[1]
The micrometre is a common unit of measurement for wavelengths of infrared radiation as well as sizes of biological cells and bacteria,[1] and for grading wool by the diameter of the fibres.[2] The width of a single human hair ranges from approximately 10 to 200 μm. The first and longest human chromosome is approximately 10μm in length.

Examples[edit]
Between 1 μm and 10 μm:

1–10 μm – length of a typical bacterium
10 μm – Size of fungal hyphae
5 μm – length of a typical human spermatozoon's head [3]
3–8 μm – width of strand of spider web silk[4]
about 10 μm – size of a fog, mist or cloud water droplet

For more examples of things measuring between one and ten micrometres, see Orders of magnitude (length) § 1 micrometre.
Between 10 μm and 100 μm

10 to 55 μm – width of wool fibre[5]
17 to 181 μm – diameter of human hair [6]
70 to 180 μm – thickness of paper

For more examples of things measuring between ten and 100 micrometres, see Orders of magnitude (length) § 10 micrometres.
SI standardization[edit]
The term micron and the symbol μ were officially accepted for use in isolation to denote the micrometre in 1879, but officially revoked by the International System of Units (SI) in 1967.[7] This became necessary because the older usage was incompatible with the official adoption of the unit prefix micro-, denoted μ, during the creation of the SI in 1960. In the SI, the systematic name micrometre became the official name of the unit, and μm became the official unit symbol.
 Nevertheless, in practice, "micron" remains a widely used term in preference to "micrometre" in many English-speaking countries, both in academic science (including geology, biology, physics, and astronomy) and in applied science and industry (including machining, the semiconductor industry, and plastics manufacturing).[citation needed] Additionally, in American English the use of "micron" helps differentiate the unit from the micrometer, a measuring device, because the unit's name in mainstream American spelling is a homograph of the device's name. In spoken English, they may be distinguished by pronunciation, as the name of the measuring device is invariably stressed on the second syllable, whereas the systematic pronunciation of the unit name, in accordance with the convention for pronouncing SI units in English, places the stress on the first syllable.
The plural of micron is normally "microns", though "micra" was occasionally used before 1950.[8][9][10]
Symbol[edit]
See also: Micro- § Symbol encoding in character sets
The official symbol for the SI prefix micro- is a Greek lowercase mu (μ).[11] In Unicode, there is also a micro sign with the codepoint U+00B5 (µ), distinct from the codepoint U+03BC (μ) of the Greek letter lowercase mu, so that machines can recognize it as the SI prefix symbol rather than as a letter. According to The Unicode Consortium, the Greek letter character is preferred,[12] but implementations must recognize the micro sign as well. Most fonts use the same glyph for the two characters.
