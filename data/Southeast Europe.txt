The European regional grouping according to The World Factbook:
  Central Europe
  Eastern Europe
  Southeastern Europe



Southeast Europe or Southeastern Europe is a geographical region of Europe, consisting primarily of the coterminous Balkan peninsula. There are many overlapping and conflicting definitions as to where exactly Southeastern Europe begins or ends or how it relates to other regions of the continent. Sovereign states that are most frequently included in the region are, in alphabetical order: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo,[a] Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia.
These boundaries can vary greatly due to political, economic, historical, cultural, and geographical considerations of the observer and as such are widely disputed.

Definition[edit]
The first known use of the term "Southeast Europe" was by Austrian researcher Johann Georg von Hahn (1811–1869) as a broader term than the traditional "Balkans".[1]
Balkans model[edit]
Main article: Balkans




The Balkan Peninsula, as defined by the Danube-Sava-Kupa line


This concept is based on the boundaries of the Balkan peninsula. The countries that have been described as being entirely within the region are: Albania, Kosovo,[a] Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Montenegro.[2]
Geographical Southeast Europe[edit]
Countries that are geographically, at least partially, described to be within the region are as follows:[3]

 Albania
 Bosnia and Herzegovina
 Bulgaria
 Croatia[4][5][6][7]
 Greece
 Kosovo[a]
 Macedonia
 Montenegro
 Romania
 Serbia
 Slovenia
 Turkey – only East Thrace is included, the area immediately west of the waterways of the Turkish Straits (Bosphorus and Dardanelles), constituting approximately 3% of Turkey's land area and 14% of the country's population. East Thrace comprises Edirne Province, Kırklareli Province, Tekirdağ Province, and part of Istanbul Province.[3]

Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe model[edit]




Another map of European regions.


The Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe was an institution aimed at strengthening peace, democracy, human rights and economy in the countries of South Eastern Europe from 1999 to 2008. It was replaced by the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) in February 2008. The RCC replaced the Stability Pact, which was driven more by outside partners such as the EU, the US, Japan and Turkey, and the countries included were: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, and Serbia.
South East Europe Transnational Cooperation Program[edit]
The South East Europe (SEE) program is a program set up within the framework of the Regional Policy's Territorial Cooperation Objective of the European Union in order to improve integration and competitiveness in the area. It had 235.6 million euro of funding available from 2007–2013.[8]

Notes[edit]



^ a b c Kosovo is the subject of a territorial dispute between the Republic of Kosovo and the Republic of Serbia. The Republic of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence on 17 February 2008, but Serbia continues to claim it as part of its own sovereign territory. The two governments began to normalise relations in 2013, as part of the Brussels Agreement. Kosovo has received formal recognition as an independent state from 112 out of 193 United Nations member states.
