The Cinema of India[8] consists of films produced across India.[9] Cinema is immensely popular in India, with as many as 1,600 films produced in various languages every year.[10][11] In terms of the number of films produced and the number of tickets sold, Indian cinema is the largest film industry in the world; in 2011, over 3.5 billion tickets were sold across the globe, which is 900,000 more tickets than Hollywood.[12] Indian films have a wide following throughout Southern Asia, and is available in mainstream cinemas across other parts of Asia, Europe, the Greater Middle East, North America, Eastern Africa, and elsewhere. Dadasaheb Phalke is known as the "Father of Indian cinema".[13][14][15][16] The Dadasaheb Phalke Award, for lifetime contribution to cinema, was instituted in his honour, by the Government of India in 1969, and is the most prestigious and coveted award in Indian cinema.[17]
In the 20th century, Indian cinema, along with the Hollywood and Chinese film industries, became a global enterprise.[18] As of 2013, in terms of annual film output, India ranks first, followed by Nollywood,[10][19] Hollywood and China.[20] In 2012, India produced 1,602 feature films.[10] The Indian film industry reached overall revenues of $1.86 billion (₹93 billion) in 2011. This is projected to rise to $3 billion (₹200 billion) in 2016.[21] In 2015, India had a total box office gross of US$2.1 billion,[7] one of the largest in the world.[22] Enhanced technology paved the way for upgrading from established cinematic norms of delivering product, altering the manner in which content reached the target audience. Biopics like Dangal emerged as transnational blockbusters grossing over $300 million worldwide[23] in the early 21st century.[18] Indian cinema found markets in over 90 countries where films from India are screened.[24] The Indian government extended film delegations to foreign countries such as the United States of America and Japan while the country's Film Producers Guild sent similar missions through Europe.[25]
The provision of foreign direct investment has made the Indian film market attractive to foreign enterprises such as 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures[26][27] and Warner Bros.[28] Indian enterprises such as AVM Productions, Prasad's Group, Sun Pictures, PVP Cinemas, Zee, UTV, Suresh Productions, Eros Films, Ayngaran International, Pyramid Saimira, Aascar Films and Adlabs also participated in producing and distributing films.[28] Tax incentives to multiplexes have aided the multiplex boom in India.[28] By 2003 as many as 30 film production companies had been listed in the National Stock Exchange of India, making the commercial presence of the medium felt.[28]
Bollywood refers to the Hindi language film industry based in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), which is the largest Indian film industry, representing 43% of Indian net box office revenue.[29] The South Indian film industry defines the five film cultures of South India as a single entity: Telugu cinema (Tollywood), Tamil cinema (Kollywood), Kannada cinema (Sandalwood), Malayalam cinema (Mollywood) and Tulu cinema (Coastalwood). Telugu and Tamil cinema represent 36% of Indian net box office revenue.[29] In the early decades of Indian cinema, the largest Indian film industry was Bengali cinema (Tollywood, based in Tollygunge).[30] Although developed independently over a long period, gross exchange of film performers and technicians as well as globalisation has helped to shape a new identity for Indian cinema.[31][32]
The Indian diaspora consists of millions of Indians overseas for which films are made available both through media such as DVDs and by screening of films in their country of residence wherever commercially feasible.[33] These earnings, accounting for some 12% of the revenue generated by a mainstream film, contribute substantially to the overall revenue of Indian cinema, the net worth of which was found to be US$1.3 billion in 2000.[34] Music in Indian cinema is another substantial revenue generator with the music rights alone accounting for 4–5% of the net revenues generated by a film in India.[34]

Following the screening of the Lumière and Robert Paul moving pictures in London (1896), animated photography became a worldwide sensation and by mid-1896 both Lumière and Robert Paul films had been shown in Bombay.[35] In the next year a film presentation by one Professor Stevenson featured a stage show at Calcutta's Star Theatre. With Stevenson's encouragement and camera Hiralal Sen, an Indian photographer, made a film of scenes from that show, namely The Flower of Persia (1898).[36] The Wrestlers (1899) by H. S. Bhatavdekar showing a wrestling match at the Hanging Gardens in Bombay was the first film ever to be shot by an Indian. It was also the first Indian documentary film.
The first Indian film released in India was Shree Pundalik a silent film in Marathi by Dadasaheb Torne on 18 May 1912 at 'Coronation Cinematograph', Bombay.[37][38] Some have argued that Pundalik does not deserve the honour of being called the first Indian film because it was a photographic recording of a popular Marathi play, and because the cameraman—a man named Johnson—was a British national and the film was processed in London.[39][40]
The first full-length motion picture in India was produced by Dadasaheb Phalke, Dadasaheb is the pioneer of Indian film industry a scholar on India's languages and culture, who brought together elements from Sanskrit epics to produce his Raja Harishchandra (1913), a silent film in Marathi. The female roles in the film were played by male actors.[41] The film marked a historic benchmark in the film industry in India. Only one print of the film was made and shown at the Coronation Cinematograph on 3 May 1913. It was a commercial success and paved the way for more such films. The first silent film in Tamil, Keechaka Vadham was made by R. Nataraja Mudaliar in 1916.[42]
The first Indian chain of cinema theatres, Madan Theatre was owned by the Parsi entrepreneur Jamshedji Framji Madan, who oversaw production of 10 films annually and distributed them throughout the Indian subcontinent starting from 1902.[41] He founded Elphinstone Bioscope Company in Calcutta. Elphinstone merged into Madan Theatres Limited in 1919 which brought many of Bengal's most popular literary works to the stage. He also produced Satyawadi Raja Harishchandra in 1917, a remake of Phalke's Raja Harishchandra (1913).
Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu was an Indian artist and a pioneer in the production of silent Indian movies and talkies.[43] Starting from 1909, he was involved in many aspects of Indian cinema's history, like travelling to different regions in Asia, to promote film work. He was the first to build and own cinema halls in Madras. He was widely known as the father of Telugu cinema . In South India, the first Tamil talkie Kalidas which released on 31 October 1931, barely 7 months after India's first talking picture Alam Ara[44] Nataraja Mudaliar also established South India's first film studio in Madras.[45]
During the early twentieth century cinema as a medium gained popularity across India's population and its many economic sections.[35] Tickets were made affordable to the common man at a low price and for the financially capable additional comforts meant additional admission ticket price.[35] Audiences thronged to cinema halls as this affordable medium of entertainment was available for as low as an anna (one-sixteenth of a rupee) in Bombay.[35] The content of Indian commercial cinema was increasingly tailored to appeal to these masses.[35] Young Indian producers began to incorporate elements of India's social life and culture into cinema.[46] Others brought with them ideas from across the world.[46] This was also the time when global audiences and markets became aware of India's film industry.[46]
In 1927, the British Government, to promote the market in India for British films over American ones, formed the Indian Cinematograph Enquiry Committee. The ICC consisted of three British and three Indians, led by T. Rangachari, a Madras lawyer.[47] This committee failed to support the desired recommendations of supporting British Film, instead recommending support for the fledgling Indian film industry. Their suggestions were shelved.
Early sound cinema (1930s–mid-1940s)[edit]
Ardeshir Irani released Alam Ara which was the first Indian talkie film, on 14 March 1931.[41] Irani later produced the first south Indian talkie film Kalidas directed by H. M. Reddy released on 31 October 1931.[48][49] Jumai Shasthi was the first Bengali talkie. Following the inception of 'talkies' in India some film stars were highly sought after and earned comfortable incomes through acting.[41] Actor of the time, Chittor V. Nagaiah, was one of the first multilingual film actor, singer, music composer, producer and directors in India. He was known as the Paul Muni of India in the media.[50][51]
In 1932, the name "Tollywood" was coined for the Bengali film industry due to Tollygunge rhyming with "Hollywood" and because it was the centre of the Indian film industry at the time. It later inspired the name "Bollywood", as Bombay later overtook Tollygunge as the center of the Indian film industry, and many other Hollywood-inspired names.[30]
In 1933, East India Film Company has produced its first Indian film in Telugu Savitri. Based on a noted stage play by Mylavaram Bala Bharathi Samajam, the film was directed by C. Pullaiah casting stage actors Vemuri Gaggaiah and Dasari Ramathilakam as Yama and Savithri, respectively and shot in Calcutta on a budget of ₹ 75,000.[52] The blockbuster film has received an honorary diploma at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival.[53] The first film studio in South India, Durga Cinetone was built in 1936 by Nidamarthi Surayya in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh.[54] As sound technology advanced, the 1930s saw the rise of music in Indian cinema with musicals such as Indra Sabha and Devi Devyani marking the beginning of song-and-dance in India's films.[41] Studios emerged across major cities such as Madras, Calcutta and Bombay as film making became an established craft by 1935, exemplified by the success of Devdas, which had managed to enthrall audiences nationwide.[55] In 1937, Kisan Kanya directed by Moti B was released. It is the first colour film made in India.[56] 1940 film, Vishwa Mohini, is the first Indian film, depicting the Indian movie world. The film was directed by Y. V. Rao and scripted by Balijepalli Lakshmikanta Kavi.[57]
Swamikannu Vincent, who had built the first cinema of South India in Coimbatore, introduced the concept of "Tent Cinema" in which a tent was erected on a stretch of open land close to a town or village to screen the films. The first of its kind was established in Madras, called "Edison's Grand Cinemamegaphone". This was due to the fact that electric carbons were used for motion picture projectors.[58] Bombay Talkies came up in 1934 and Prabhat Studios in Pune had begun production of films meant for the Marathi language audience.[55] Filmmaker R. S. D. Choudhury produced Wrath (1930), banned by the British Raj in India as it depicted actors as Indian leaders, an expression censored during the days of the Indian independence movement.[41] Sant Tukaram, a 1936 film based on the life of Tukaram (1608–50), a Varkari Sant and spiritual poet, was screened at the 1937 edition of Venice Film Festival and thus became the first Indian film to be screened at an international film festival. The film was subsequently adjudged as one of the three best films of the year in the World.[59] In 1938, Gudavalli Ramabrahmam, has co-produced and directed the social problem film, Raithu Bidda, which was banned by the British administration in the region, for depicting the uprise of the peasantry among the Zamindars during the British raj.[60][61]
The Indian Masala film—a slang term used for commercial films with a mix of song, dance, romance etc.—arose following World War II.[55] South Indian cinema gained prominence throughout India with the release of S.S. Vasan's Chandralekha.[55] During the 1940s cinema in South India accounted for nearly half of India's cinema halls and cinema came to be viewed as an instrument of cultural revival.[55] The partition of India following its independence divided the nation's assets and a number of studios went to the newly formed Pakistan.[55] The strife partition would become an enduring subject for film making during the decades that followed.[55]
After Indian independence the cinema of India was inquired by the S. K. Patil Commission.[62] S.K. Patil, head of the commission, viewed cinema in India as a 'combination of art, industry, and showmanship' while noting its commercial value.[62] Patil further recommended setting up of a Film Finance Corporation under the Ministry of Finance.[63] This advice was later taken up in 1960 and the institution came into being to provide financial support to talented filmmakers throughout India.[63] The Indian government had established a Films Division by 1948 which eventually became one of the largest documentary film producers in the world with an annual production of over 200 short documentaries, each released in 18 languages with 9000 prints for permanent film theatres across the country.[64]
The Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA), an art movement with a communist inclination, began to take shape through the 1940s and the 1950s.[62] A number of realistic IPTA plays, such as Bijon Bhattacharya's Nabanna in 1944 (based on the tragedy of the Bengal famine of 1943), prepared the ground for the solidification of realism in Indian cinema, exemplified by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas's Dharti Ke Lal (Children of the Earth) in 1946.[62] The IPTA movement continued to emphasize realism and went on to produce Mother India and Pyaasa, among India's most recognizable cinematic productions.[65]
Golden Age of Indian cinema (late 1940s–1960s)[edit]
Following India's independence, the period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s are regarded by film historians as the Golden Age of Indian cinema.[66][67][68] Some of the most critically acclaimed Indian films of all time were produced during this period.




Satyajit Ray is recognized as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century.[69][70][71][72][73][74]


This period saw the emergence of a new Parallel Cinema movement, mainly led by Bengali cinema,[75] which accounted for a quarter of India's film output at the time.[76] The movement emphasized social realism. Early examples of films in this movement include Dharti Ke Lal (1946) directed by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and based on the Bengal famine of 1943,[77] Neecha Nagar (1946) directed by Chetan Anand and written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas,[78] Ritwik Ghatak's Nagarik (1952),[79][80] and Bimal Roy's Do Bigha Zamin (1953), laying the foundations for Indian neorealism[81] and the "Indian New Wave".[82] Pather Panchali (1955), the first part of The Apu Trilogy (1955–1959) by Satyajit Ray, marked his entry in Indian cinema.[83] The Apu Trilogy won major prizes at all the major international film festivals and led to the Parallel Cinema movement being firmly established in Indian cinema. Its influence on world cinema can also be felt in the "youthful coming-of-age dramas that have flooded art houses since the mid-fifties" which "owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy".[84]
The cinematographer Subrata Mitra, who made his debut with Satyajit Ray's The Apu Trilogy, also had an important influence on cinematography across the world. One of his most important techniques was bounce lighting, to recreate the effect of daylight on sets. He pioneered the technique while filming Aparajito (1956), the second part of The Apu Trilogy.[85] Some of the experimental techniques which Satyajit Ray pioneered include photo-negative flashbacks and X-ray digressions while filming Pratidwandi (1972).[86] Ray's 1967 script for a film to be called The Alien, which was eventually cancelled, is also widely believed to have been the inspiration for Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).[87][88][89] Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak went on to direct many more critically acclaimed art films, and they were followed by other acclaimed Indian independent filmmakers such as M. S. Sathyu, Mrinal Sen, Mani Kaul, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, G. Aravindan, Girish Kasaravalli and Buddhadeb Dasgupta.[75] During the 1960s, Indira Gandhi's intervention during her reign as the Information and Broadcasting Minister of India further led to production of off-beat cinematic expression being supported by the official Film Finance Corporation.[63]
Commercial Hindi cinema also began thriving, with examples of acclaimed films at the time include Pyaasa (1957) and Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959) directed by Guru Dutt and written by Abrar Alvi, and Awaara (1951) and Shree 420 (1955) directed by Raj Kapoor and written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas. These films expressed social themes mainly dealing with working-class urban life in India; Awaara presented the city as both a nightmare and a dream, while Pyaasa critiqued the unreality of city life.[75] Some epic films were also produced at the time, including Mehboob Khan's Mother India (1957), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film,[90] and K. Asif's Mughal-e-Azam (1960).[91] V. Shantaram's Do Aankhen Barah Haath (1957) is believed to have inspired the Hollywood film The Dirty Dozen (1967).[92]
Mehboob Khan's Mother India (1957), a remake of his earlier Aurat (1940), was the first Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Mother India was also an important film that defined the conventions of Hindi cinema for decades.[93][94][95] It spawned a new genre of dacoit films, which was further defined by Gunga Jumna (1961).[96] Written and produced by Dilip Kumar, Gunga Jumna was a dacoit crime drama about two brothers on opposite sides of the law, a theme that later became common in Indian films since the 1970s.[97] Madhumati (1958), directed by Bimal Roy and written by Ritwik Ghatak, popularised the theme of reincarnation in Western popular culture.[98] Other mainstream Hindi filmmakers at the time included Kamal Amrohi and Vijay Bhatt.
Dilip Kumar (Muhammad Yusuf Khan), who debuted in the 1940s and rose to fame in the 1950s, was one of the biggest Indian movie stars. He was a pioneer of method acting, predating Hollywood method actors such as Marlon Brando. Much like Brando's influence on New Hollywood actors such as Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Kumar inspired many famous Indian actors, from Amitabh Bachchan and Naseeruddin Shah to Shah Rukh Khan to Nawazuddin Siddiqui.[99] Kumar was described as "the ultimate method actor" (natural actor) by Satyajit Ray.[100]
Ever since the social realist film Neecha Nagar, directed by Chetan Anand and written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas, won the Grand Prize (Palme d'Or) at the first Cannes Film Festival in 1946,[78] Indian films were frequently in competition for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for nearly every year in the 1950s and early 1960s, with a number of them winning major prizes at the festival. Satyajit Ray also won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for Aparajito (1956), the second part of The Apu Trilogy, and the Golden Bear and two Silver Bears for Best Director at the Berlin International Film Festival.[101] The films of Khwaja Ahmad Abbas were nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival three times, with Neecha Nagar winning it, along with nominations for Awaara and Pardesi (1957).
Ray's contemporaries, Ritwik Ghatak and Guru Dutt, were overlooked in their own lifetimes but had belatedly generated international recognition much later in the 1980s and 1990s.[101][102] Ray is regarded as one of the greatest auteurs of 20th century cinema,[103] with Dutt[104] and Ghatak.[105] In 1992, the Sight & Sound Critics' Poll ranked Ray at No. 7 in its list of "Top 10 Directors" of all time,[106] while Dutt was ranked No. 73 in the 2002 Sight & Sound greatest directors poll.[104]
A number of Indian films from this era are often included among the greatest films of all time in various critics' and directors' polls. A number of Satyajit Ray films appeared in the Sight & Sound Critics' Poll, including The Apu Trilogy (ranked No. 4 in 1992 if votes are combined),[107] Jalsaghar (ranked No. 27 in 1992), Charulata (ranked No. 41 in 1992)[108] and Aranyer Din Ratri (ranked No. 81 in 1982).[109] The 2002 Sight & Sound critics' and directors' poll also included the Guru Dutt films Pyaasa and Kaagaz Ke Phool (both tied at #160), the Ritwik Ghatak films Meghe Dhaka Tara (ranked #231) and Komal Gandhar (ranked #346), and Raj Kapoor's Awaara, Vijay Bhatt's Baiju Bawra, Mehboob Khan's Mother India and K. Asif's Mughal-e-Azam all tied at #346.[110] In 1998, the critics' poll conducted by the Asian film magazine Cinemaya included The Apu Trilogy (ranked No. 1 if votes are combined), Ray's Charulata and Jalsaghar (both tied at #11), and Ghatak's Subarnarekha (also tied at #11).[105]
At this juncture, South Indian cinema saw the production works based on the epic Mahabharata, such as Mayabazar, listed by IBN Live's 2013 Poll as the greatest Indian film of all time,[111] and Narthanasala received awards for best production design and best actor to S. V. Ranga Rao, at the Indonesian Film Festival.[112] Sivaji Ganesan became India's first actor to receive an international award when he won the "Best Actor" award at the Afro-Asian film festival in 1960 and was awarded the title of Chevalier in the Legion of Honour by the French Government in 1995.[113] Tamil cinema is also influenced by Dravidian politics,[114] with prominent film personalities like C N Annadurai, M G Ramachandran, M Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa becoming Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu.[115]
Contemporary Indian cinema (1970s–present)[edit]
Some filmmakers such as Shyam Benegal continued to produce realistic Parallel Cinema throughout the 1970s,[116] alongside Satyajit Ray, M. S. Sathyu, Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Buddhadeb Dasgupta and Gautam Ghose in Bengali cinema; K Balachandar, Balu Mahendra, Bharathiraaja and Mani Ratnam in Tamil cinema, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Shaji N. Karun, John Abraham and G. Aravindan also Bharathan and Padmarajan in Malayalam cinema; Nirad Mohapatra in Oriya cinema; K. N. T. Sastry and B. Narsing Rao in Telugu cinema; Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, Ketan Mehta, Govind Nihalani, Ram Gopal Varma and Vijaya Mehta in Hindi cinema.[75] However, the art film bent of the Film Finance Corporation came under criticism during a Committee on Public Undertakings investigation in 1976, which accused the body of not doing enough to encourage commercial cinema.[117]
The late 1960s to early 1970s saw the rise of Hindi commercial cinema in form of enduring films such as Aradhana (1969), Sachaa Jhutha (1970), Haathi Mere Saathi (1971), Anand (1971), Kati Patang (1971) and Amar Prem (1972), Dushman (1972), Daag (1973), establishing Rajesh Khanna as the first actor to be labeled a "superstar" in Indian cinema.









The screenwriting duo Salim-Javed, consisting of Salim Khan (l) and Javed Akhtar (r), revolutionized Indian cinema in the 1970s,[118] and are considered Bollywood's greatest screenwriters.[119]


By the early 1970s, Hindi cinema was experiencing thematic stagnation,[120] dominated by musical romance films.[121] The arrival of screenwriter duo Salim-Javed, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar, marked a paradigm shift, revitalizing the industry.[120] They began the genre of gritty, violent, Bombay underworld crime films in the early 1970s, with films such as Zanjeer (1973) and Deewaar (1975).[122][123] They reinterpreted the rural themes of Mehboob Khan's Mother India (1957) and Dilip Kumar's Gunga Jumna (1961) in a contemporary urban context reflecting the socio-economic and socio-political climate of 1970s India,[120][124] channeling the growing discontent and disillusionment among the masses,[120] and unprecedented growth of slums,[125] and dealing with themes involving urban poverty, corruption, and crime,[126] as well as anti-establishment themes.[127] This resulted in their creation of the "angry young man", personified by Amitabh Bachchan,[127] who reinterpreted Dilip Kumar's performance in Gunga Jumna in a contemporary urban context,[120][124] and giving a voice to the angst of the urban poor.[125]
By the mid-1970s, crime-action films like Zanjeer and Sholay (1975) solidified Amitabh Bachchan's position as a lead actor.[117] The devotional classic Jai Santoshi Ma made on a shoe-string budget was also released in 1975 and became a box office success and a cult classic.[117] Another important film from 1975 was Deewar, directed by Yash Chopra and written by Salim-Javed, inspired by inspired by Gunga Jumna.[97] A crime film pitting "a policeman against his brother, a gang leader based on the real-life smuggler Haji Mastan", portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan, it was described as being "absolutely key to Indian cinema" by Danny Boyle.[128]
The 1970s was also when the name "Bollywood" was coined,[129][130] and when the quintessential conventions of commercial Bollywood films were established.[131] Key to this was the emergence of the masala film genre, which combines elements of multiple genres (action, comedy, romance, drama, melodrama, musical). The masala film was pioneered in the early 1970s by filmmaker Nasir Hussain,[132] along with screenwriter duo Salim-Javed,[131] pioneering the Bollywood blockbuster format.[131] Yaadon Ki Baarat (1973), directed by Hussain and written by Salim-Javed, has been identified as the first masala film and the "first" quintessentially "Bollywood" film.[133][131] Salim-Javed went on to write more successful masala films in the 1970s and 1980s.[131] Masala films launched Amitabh Bachchan into the biggest Bollywood movie star of the 1970s and 1980s. A landmark for the masala film genre was Amar Akbar Anthony (1977),[134][133] directed by Manmohan Desai and written by Kader Khan. Manmohan Desai went on to successfully exploit the genre in the 1970s and 1980s.
Their work of Salim-Javed was also highly influential in South Indian cinema. In addition to writing two Kannada films, many of their Bollywood films had remakes produced in other South Indian film industries, including Tamil cinema, Telugu cinema and Malayalam cinema. While the Bollywood directors and producers held the rights to their films in Northern India, it was Salim-Javed who held the rights to their films in South India, where they sold the remake rights to various South Indian filmmakers, usually for around ₹1 lakh (equivalent to ₹27 lakh or US$42,000 in 2016) each, for films such as Zanjeer, Yaadon Ki Baarat, and Don.[135] Several of these remakes became breakthroughs for Rajinikanth, who was cast in Amitabh Bachchan's role for several Tamil remakes.[121][136]
1980 Telugu film, Sankarabharanam, which dealt with the revival of Indian classical music, has won the Prize of the Public at the Besancon Film Festival of France in 1981.[137] 1970 Kannada film, Samskara directed by Pattabhirama Reddy, pioneered the parallel cinema movement in south Indian cinema. The film won Bronze Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival.[138]
Many Tamil-language films have premiered or have been selected as special presentations at various film festivals across the globe, such as Mani Ratnam's Kannathil Muthamittal, Vasanthabalan's Veyyil and Ameer Sultan's Paruthiveeran. Kanchivaram (2009) was selected to be premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Tamil films have been a part of films submitted by India for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language on eight occasions, next only to Hindi.[139] Kamal Hassan's Nayagan (1987) was included in Time magazine's "All-TIME" 100 best movies list.[140] In 1991, Marupakkam directed by K.S. Sethu Madhavan, became the first Tamil film to win the National Film Award for Best Feature Film, the feat was repeated by Kanchivaram in 2007.[141]
Malayalam cinema of Kerala experienced its own 'Golden Age' in the 1980s and early 1990s. Some of the most acclaimed Indian filmmakers at the time were from the Malayalam industry, including Adoor Gopalakrishnan, G. Aravindan, T. V. Chandran and Shaji N. Karun.[142] Adoor Gopalakrishnan, who is often considered to be Satyajit Ray's spiritual heir,[143] directed some of his most acclaimed films during this period, including Elippathayam (1981) which won the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival, as well as Mathilukal (1989) which won major prizes at the Venice Film Festival.[144]
Shaji N. Karun's debut film Piravi (1989) won the Camera d'Or at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, while his second film Swaham (1994) was in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival.[145] Commercial Malayalam cinema also began gaining popularity with the action films of Jayan, a popular stunt actor whose success was short-lived when he died while filming a dangerous helicopter stunt.
Commercial Hindi cinema further grew throughout the 1980s and the 1990s with the release of films such as Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981), Mr India (1987), Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988), Tezaab (1988), Chandni (1989), Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), Baazigar (1993), Darr (1993),[117] Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994), Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Pyar Kiya Toh Darna Kya (1998) and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), many of which starred Anil Kapoor, Salman Khan, Sridevi, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit and Kajol. At this juncture, Shekhar Kapur's cult classic, Bandit Queen (1994) which received international recognition, has also garnered high criticism by Arundhati Roy in her film review entitled "The Great Indian Rape-Trick". However, the film highlighted the revival of feminist themes.[146][147]
In the late 1990s, 'Parallel Cinema' began experiencing a resurgence in Hindi cinema, largely due to the critical and commercial success of Satya (1998), a crime film based on the Bombay underworld, written and directed by Ram Gopal Varma, with screenplay by Anurag Kashyap. The film's success led to the emergence of a distinct genre known as Mumbai noir,[148] urban films reflecting social problems in Bombay city.[149] Later films made on organised crime in Bombay include Madhur Bhandarkar's Chandni Bar (2001) and Traffic Signal (2007), Ram Gopal Varma's Company (2002) and its sequel D (2005), as well as Anurag Kashyap's Black Friday (2004).
Since the 1990s, the three biggest Bollywood movie stars have been the "Three Khans": Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, and Salman Khan.[150][151] Combined, they have starred in the top ten highest-grossing Bollywood films. The three Khans have had successful careers since the late 1980s,[150] and have dominated the Indian box office since the 1990s,[152] across three decades.[153] Shah Rukh Khan was the most successful Indian actor for most of the 1990s and 2000s, while Aamir Khan has been the most successful Indian actor since the late 2000s;[154] according to Forbes, Aamir Khan is "arguably the world's biggest movie star" as of 2017, due to his immense popularity in the world's two most populous nations, India and China.[155]
Vishal Bhardwaj's 2014 film Haider, the third instalment of Indian Shakespearean Trilogy after Maqbool (2003) and Omkara (2006),[156] won the People's Choice Award at the 9th Rome Film Festival in the Mondo Genere category making it the first Indian film to achieve this feat.[157] Other art film directors active today include Mrinal Sen, Mir Shaani, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, Gautam Ghose, Sandip Ray and Aparna Sen in Bengali cinema; Puttanna Kanagal, Dore Bhagavan, Siddalingaiah in Kannada; Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Shaji N. Karun and T.V. Chandran in Malayalam cinema; Nirad Mohapatra in Oriya cinema; Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, Ketan Mehta, Govind Nihalani, Shyam Benegal,[75] Mira Nair, Nagesh Kukunoor, Sudhir Mishra and Nandita Das in Hindi cinema; K. N. T. Sastry, B. Narsing Rao, Akkineni Kutumba Rao, Deva Katta in Telugu cinema and Santosh Sivan in Tamil cinema. Deepa Mehta, Anant Balani, Homi Adajania, Vijay Singh and Sooni Taraporevala have garnered recognition in Indian English cinema.
Global discourse[edit]
Indians during the colonial rule bought film equipment from Europe.[46] The British funded wartime propaganda films during World War II, some of which showed the Indian army pitted against the axis powers, specifically the Empire of Japan, which had managed to infiltrate into India.[158] One such story was Burma Rani, which depicted civilian resistance offered to Japanese occupation by the British and Indians present in Myanmar.[158] Pre-independence businessmen such as J. F. Madan and Abdulally Esoofally traded in global cinema.[41]
Indian cinema's early contacts with other regions became visible with its films making early inroads into the Soviet Union, Middle East, Southeast Asia,[159] and China. Some mainstream Indian movie stars, like the Akshay Kumar, Khans of Bollywood (Aamir Khan,[160] Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Dilip Kumar), the Kapoor family (Raj Kapoor,[161] Rishi Kapoor),[162] Nargis,[161] Mithun Chakraborty,[163] Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Rajnikanth, Madhuri Dixit and Aishwarya Rai gained international fame across Asia[164][165][166] and Eastern Europe.[167][168] For example, Indian films were popular in the Soviet Union, more so than Hollywood films[169][170] and occasionally even domestic Soviet films.[171] From 1954 to 1991, 206 Indian films (175 of which were Bollywood films) were imported in the Soviet Union, drawing higher average audience figures than domestic Soviet productions,[170][172] with 50 Indian films drawing more than 20 million viewers (compared to 41 Hollywood films),[173][174] with some such as Awaara (1951) and Disco Dancer (1982) drawing more than 60 million viewers,[175][176] establishing Indian actors like Raj Kapoor, Nargis,[176] Rishi Kapoor[162] and Mithun Chakroborty as household names in the country.[163] The Hindi film actors Raj Kapoor[177] and Aamir Khan also became very popular in China, with films such as Awaara, 3 Idiots (2009), and Dangal (2016),[160][177] one of the top 20 highest-grossing films in China.[178]
Indian films frequently appeared in international fora and film festivals.[159] This allowed Parallel Bengali filmmakers such as Satyajit Ray to achieve worldwide fame, with his films gaining success among European, American and Asian audiences.[179] Ray's work subsequently had a worldwide impact, with filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese,[180] James Ivory,[181] Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan, François Truffaut,[182] Steven Spielberg,[87][88][89] Carlos Saura,[183] Jean-Luc Godard,[184] Isao Takahata,[185] Gregory Nava, Ira Sachs and Wes Anderson[186] being influenced by his cinematic style, and many others such as Akira Kurosawa praising his work.[187] The "youthful coming-of-age dramas that have flooded art houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy".[84] Subrata Mitra's cinematographic technique of bounce lighting also originates from The Apu Trilogy.[85] Ray's film Kanchenjungha (1962) also introduced a narrative structure that resembles later hyperlink cinema.[188] Since the 1980s, some previously overlooked Indian filmmakers such as Ritwik Ghatak[189] and Guru Dutt[190] have posthumously gained international acclaim.
Tamil films have enjoyed consistent popularity among populations in South East Asia and many parts of the world. Since Chandralekha, Muthu was the second Tamil film to be dubbed into Japanese (as Mutu: Odoru Maharaja[191]) and grossed a record $1.6 million in 1998.[192] In 2010, Enthiran grossed a record $4 million in North America.
Many Asian and South Asian countries increasingly came to find Indian cinema as more suited to their sensibilities than Western cinema.[159] Jigna Desai holds that by the 21st century, Indian cinema had managed to become 'deterritorialized', spreading over to the many parts of the world where Indian diaspora was present in significant numbers, and becoming an alternative to other international cinema.[193]
Indian cinema has more recently begun influencing Western musical films, and played a particularly instrumental role in the revival of the genre in the Western world. Baz Luhrmann stated that his successful musical film Moulin Rouge! (2001) was directly inspired by Bollywood musicals.[194] The critical and financial success of Moulin Rouge! renewed interest in the then-moribund Western musical genre, subsequently fuelling a renaissance of the genre.[195] Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire (2008) was also directly inspired by Indian films,[128][196] and is considered to be a "homage to Hindi commercial cinema".[197] Other Indian filmmakers are also making attempts at reaching a more global audience, with upcoming films by directors such as Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Jahnu Barua, Sudhir Mishra and Pan Nalin.[198]
Indian Cinema was also recognised at the American Academy Awards. Indian films, Mother India (1957), Salaam Bombay! (1988) and Lagaan (2001), were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Indian winners of the Academy Awards include Bhanu Athaiya (costume designer), Satyajit Ray (filmmaker), A. R. Rahman (music composer), Resul Pookutty (sound editor) and Gulzar (lyricist), Cottalango Leon and Rahul Thakkar Sci-Tech Award.[199]
Netflix have also entered India.[200]

Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake identify six major influences that have shaped the conventions of Indian popular cinema:[205]

The first was the ancient Indian epics of Mahabharata and Ramayana which have exerted a profound influence on the thought and imagination of Indian popular cinema, particularly in its narratives. Examples of this influence include the techniques of a side story, back-story and story within a story. Indian popular films often have plots which branch off into sub-plots; such narrative dispersals can clearly be seen in the 1993 films Khalnayak and Gardish.
The second influence was the impact of ancient Sanskrit drama, with its highly stylised nature and emphasis on spectacle, where music, dance and gesture combined "to create a vibrant artistic unit with dance and mime being central to the dramatic experience." Sanskrit dramas were known as natya, derived from the root word nrit (dance), characterising them as spectacular dance-dramas which has continued in Indian cinema.[206] The Rasa method of performance, dating back to ancient Sanskrit drama, is one of the fundamental features that differentiate Indian cinema from that of the Western world. In the Rasa method, empathetic "emotions are conveyed by the performer and thus felt by the audience," in contrast to the Western Stanislavski method where the actor must become "a living, breathing embodiment of a character" rather than "simply conveying emotion." The rasa method of performance is clearly apparent in the performances of popular Hindi film actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan. It is also evident in the nationally acclaimed Hindi films like Rang De Basanti (2006) starring Aamir Khan in the lead role,[207] and internationally acclaimed Bengali films directed by Satyajit Ray.[208]
The third influence was the traditional folk theatre of India, which became popular from around the 10th century with the decline of Sanskrit theatre. These regional traditions include the Yatra of West Bengal, the Ramlila of Uttar Pradesh, Yakshagana of Karnataka, 'Chindu Natakam' of Andhra Pradesh, and the Terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu.
The fourth influence was Parsi theatre, which "blended realism and fantasy, music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic discourse of melodrama. The Parsi plays contained crude humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and dazzling stagecraft."[206] All of these influences are clearly evident in the masala film genre of the 1970s and early 1980s, such as Coolie (1983), and to an extent in more recent critically acclaimed films such as Rang De Basanti.[207]
The fifth influence was Hollywood, where musicals were popular from the 1920s to the 1950s, though Indian filmmakers departed from their Hollywood counterparts in several ways. "For example, the Hollywood musicals had as their plot the world of entertainment itself. Indian filmmakers, while enhancing the elements of fantasy so pervasive in Indian popular films, used song and music as a natural mode of articulation in a given situation in their films. There is a strong Indian tradition of narrating mythology, history, fairy stories and so on through song and dance." In addition, "whereas Hollywood filmmakers strove to conceal the constructed nature of their work so that the realistic narrative was wholly dominant, Indian filmmakers made no attempt to conceal the fact that what was shown on the screen was a creation, an illusion, a fiction. However, they demonstrated how this creation intersected with people's day-to-day lives in complex and interesting ways."[209]
The final influence was Western musical television, particularly MTV, which has had an increasing influence since the 1990s, as can be seen in the pace, camera angles, dance sequences and music of recent Indian films. An early example of this approach was in Mani Ratnam's Bombay (1995).[210]

Sharmistha Gooptu and Bhaumik also identify Indo-Persian/Islamicate culture as a major influence. In the early 20th century, Urdu was the lingua franca of popular cultural performances across northern India, established in popular performance art traditions such as nautch dancing, Urdu poetry, and Parsi theater. Urdu and related Hindi dialects were the most widely understood across northern India, thus Hindi-Urdu became the standardized language of early Indian talkies. The One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights) also had a strong influence, on Parsi theater which performed "Persianate adventure-romances" that were adapted into films, and on early Bombay cinema where "Arabian Nights cinema" was a popular genre.[211] Todd Stadtman identifies several foreign influences on commercial Bollywood masala films in the 1970s: New Hollywood, Hong Kong martial arts cinema, and Italian exploitation films.[212]
Like mainstream Indian popular cinema, Indian Parallel Cinema was also influenced also by a combination of Indian theatre (such as Sanskrit drama and Parsi theater) and Indian literature (such as Bengali literature and Urdu poetry), but differs when it comes to foreign influences, where it is more influenced by European cinema (particularly Italian neorealism and French poetic realism) rather than Hollywood. Satyajit Ray cited Italian filmmaker Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948) and French filmmaker Jean Renoir's The River (1951), which he assisted, as influences on his debut film Pather Panchali (1955). Besides the influence of European cinema and Bengali literature, Ray is also indebted to the Indian theatrical tradition, particularly the Rasa method of classical Sanskrit drama. The complicated doctrine of Rasa "centers predominantly on feeling experienced not only by the characters but also conveyed in a certain artistic way to the spectator. The duality of this kind of a rasa imbrication" shows in The Apu Trilogy.[208] Bimal Roy's Two Acres of Land (1953) was also influenced by De Sica's Bicycle Thieves and in turn paved the way for the Indian New Wave, which began around the same time as the French New Wave and the Japanese New Wave.[82] Ray known as one of the most important influences to Parallel Cinema, was depicted as an auteur (Wollen). The focus of the majority of his stories portrayed the lower middle class and the unemployed (Wollen). It wasn't until the late 1960s that Parallel Cinema support grew (Wollen).[213]
Multilinguals[edit]
Some Indian films are known as "multilinguals," having been filmed in similar but non-identical versions in different languages. This was done in the 1930s. According to Rajadhyaksha and Willemen in the Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema (1994), in its most precise form, a multilingual is

a bilingual or a trilingual [that] was the kind of film made in the 1930s in the studio era, when different but identical takes were made of every shot in different languages, often with different leading stars but identical technical crew and music.[214]:15

Rajadhyaksha and Willemen note that in seeking to construct their Encyclopedia, they often found it "extremely difficult to distinguish multilinguals in this original sense from dubbed versions, remakes, reissues or, in some cases, the same film listed with different titles, presented as separate versions in different languages ... it will take years of scholarly work to establish definitive data in this respect."[214]:15
Regional industries[edit]
Films are made in many cities and regions in India including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Assam, Bengal, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu, Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Konkan (Goa), Northern Telengana, Northern Karnataka & Ranchi(Jharkhand), Kerala, Maharashtra, Meitei, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu among others.

Assamese cinema[edit]

First Assamese motion picture, Joymati, filmed in 1935


The Assamese language film industry traces its origin to the works of revolutionary visionary Rupkonwar Jyotiprasad Agarwala, who was also a distinguished poet, playwright, composer and freedom fighter. He was instrumental in the production of the first Assamese film Joymati[216] in 1935, under the banner of Critrakala Movietone. Due to the lack of trained technicians, Jyotiprasad, while making his maiden film, had to shoulder the added responsibilities as the script writer, producer, director, choreographer, editor, set and costume designer, lyricist and music director. The film, completed with a budget of 60,000 rupees, was released on 10 March 1935. The picture failed miserably. Like so many early Indian films, the negatives and complete prints of Joymati are missing. Some effort has been made privately by Altaf Mazid to restore and subtitle whatever is left of the prints. Despite the significant financial loss from Joymati, the second picture, Indramalati, was filmed between 1937 and 1938, and was finally released in 1939. The beginning of the 21st century has seen Bollywood-style Assamese movies hitting the screen.[217]
Bengali cinema (Tollywood)[edit]




A scene from Dena Paona, 1931, the first Bengali talkie


Main article: Cinema of West Bengal
The Bengali language cinematic tradition of Tollygunge located in West Bengal has had reputable filmmakers such as Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen among its most acclaimed.[218] Recent Bengali films that have captured national attention include Rituparno Ghosh's Choker Bali, starring Aishwarya Rai.[219] Bengali filmmaking also includes Bengali science fiction films and films that focus on social issues.[220] In 1993, the Bengali industry's net output was 57 films.[221]
The history of cinema in Bengal dates back to the 1890s, when the first "bioscopes" were shown in theatres in Calcutta. Within five years, the first seeds of the industry were sown by Hiralal Sen, considered a stalwart of Victorian era cinema when he set up the Royal Bioscope Company, producing scenes from the stage productions of a number of popular shows at the Star Theatre, Calcutta, Minerva Theatre, Classic Theatre. Following a long gap after Sen's works, Dhirendra Nath Ganguly (Known as D.G.) established Indo British Film Co, the first Bengali owned production company, in 1918. However, the first Bengali Feature film Billwamangal was produced in 1919 under the banner of Madan Theatre. Bilat Ferat was the IBFC's first production in 1921. Madan Theatres production of Jamai Shashthi was the first Bengali talkie.[222]
In 1932, the name "Tollywood" was coined for the Bengali film industry due to Tollygunge rhyming with "Hollywood" and because it was the centre of the Indian film industry at the time. It later inspired the name "Bollywood", as Bombay later overtook Tollygunge as the center of the Indian film industry, and many other Hollywood-inspired names.[30] The 'Parallel Cinema' movement began in the Bengali film industry in the 1950s. A long history has been traversed since then, with stalwarts such as Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak and others having earned international acclaim and securing their place in the history of film and actors like Uttam Kumar and Soumitra Chatterjee were the greatest actor in Bengali film industry.
Brajbhasha cinema[edit]
Braj Bhasha language films present Brij culture mainly to rural people, predominant in the nebulous Braj region centred around Mathura, Agra, Aligarh and Hathras in Western Uttar Pradesh and Bharatpur & Dholpur in Rajasthan. It is the predominant language in the central stretch of the Ganges-Yamuna Doab in Uttar Pradesh. The first Brij Bhasha movie produced in India was Brij Bhoomi (1982), which was a success throughout the country.[223] made by actor, producer & director Shiv Kumar in banner of "Ocaon Movies".[224] Later Brij Bhasha cinema saw the production of films like Jamuna Kinare, Brij Kau Birju, Bhakta Surdas, and Jesus.[225][226] The culture of Brij is presented in the films Krishna Tere Desh Main (Hindi), Kanha Ki Braj Bhumi,[227]Brij ki radha dwarika ke shyam[228] and Bawre Nain,[229]
Bhojpuri cinema[edit]
Main article: Bhojpuri cinema
Bhojpuri language films predominantly cater to people who live in the regions of western Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh and also have a large audience in Delhi and Bombay due to migration of Bhojpuri speakers to these metros. Besides India, there is a large market for these films in other Bhojpuri speaking countries of the West Indies, Oceania, and South America.[230] Bhojpuri language film's history begins in 1962 with the well-received film Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo ("Mother Ganges, I will offer you a yellow sari"), which was directed by Kundan Kumar.[231] Throughout the following decades, films were produced only in fits and starts. Films such as Bidesiya ("Foreigner" 1963, directed by S. N. Tripathi) and Ganga ("Ganges," 1965, directed by Kundan Kumar) were profitable and popular, but in general Bhojpuri films were not commonly produced in the 1960s and 1970s.
The industry experienced a revival in 2001 with the super hit Saiyyan Hamar ("My Sweetheart," directed by Mohan Prasad), which shot the hero of that film, Ravi Kissan, to superstardom.[232] This success was quickly followed by several other remarkably successful films, including Panditji Batai Na Biyah Kab Hoi ("Priest, tell me when I will marry") in 2005, directed by Mohan Prasad, and Sasura Bada Paisa Wala ("My father-in-law, the rich guy") in 2005. In a measure of the Bhojpuri film industry's rise, both of these did much better business in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar than mainstream Bollywood hits at the time, and both films, made on extremely tight budgets, earned back more than ten times their production costs.[233] Although a smaller industry compared to other Indian film industries, the extremely rapid success of their films has led to dramatic increases in Bhojpuri cinema's visibility, and the industry now supports an awards show[234] and a trade magazine, Bhojpuri City.[235]
Chhattisgarhi cinema[edit]
Main article: Chhollywood
Chhollywood was born in 1965 with the first Chhattisgarhi film Kahi Debe Sandesh ("In Black and White"), directed and produced by Manu Nayak.[236] It was a story of intercaste love and it is said that former Indian Prime minister Indira Gandhi watched the movie.[citation needed] Naidu[who?] wrote the lyrics for the film,[237] and two songs of the movie were sung by Indian singer Mohammad Rafi. Niranjan Tiwari directed Ghar Dwar in 1971, produced by Vijay Kumar Pandey. However, both movies did not do well at the box office, and disappointed the producers. No movie was produced[clarification needed] for nearly 30 years thereafter.[238]
Gujarati cinema[edit]
Main article: Gujarati cinema
Before the arrival of talkies, several silent films were closely related with Gujarati people and culture. Many film directors, producers and actors who are associated with silent films were Gujarati and Parsi. There were twenty leading film company and studios owned by Gujaratis between 1913 and 1931. They were mostly located in Bombay (now Mumbai). There were at least forty-four leading Gujarati directors during this period.[239]
Gujarati cinema dates back to 9 April 1932, when the first Gujarati film, Narsinh Mehta, was released.[239][240][241] Leeludi Dharti (1968) was the first colour film of Gujarati cinema.[242] After flourishing through the 1960s to 1980s, the industry saw a decline. The industry has been revived in recent times. The film industry has produced more than one thousand films since its inception.[243] In 2005, the Government of Gujarat announced a 100% entertainment tax exemption for Gujarati films.[244]
Gujarati cinema is chiefly based on scripts which range from mythology to history and social to political. Since its origin Gujarati cinema has experimented with stories and issues from Indian society. The films are generally targeted at a rural audience but after a recent revival also caters to an audience with urban subjects.[239]
Hindi cinema (Bollywood)[edit]
Main article: Bollywood




Amitabh Bacchan has been a popular Bollywood actor for over 45 years.[245]


The Hindi language film industry of Bombay—also known as[246] Bollywood—is the largest and most powerful branch and controls Indian cinema.[247] Hindi cinema initially explored issues of caste and culture in films such as Achhut Kanya (1936) and Sujata (1959).[248] International visibility came to the industry with Raj Kapoor's Awara and later in Shakti Samantha's Aradhana starring Rajesh Khanna and Sharmila Tagore.[249] Hindi cinema grew during the 1990s with the release of as many as 215 films.
In 1995 the Indian economy began showing sustainable annual growth, and Hindi cinema, as a commercial enterprise, grew at a growth rate of 15% annually.[33] The salary of lead stars increased greatly. Many actors signed contracts for simultaneous work in 3–4 films.[34] Institutions such as the Industrial Development Bank of India also came forward to finance Hindi films.[34] A number of magazines such as Filmfare, Stardust, and Cine Blitz became popular.[250]
The audience's reaction towards Hindi cinema is distinctive, with involvement in the films via clapping, singing, and reciting familiar dialogue with the actors.[251]

Main article: Masala (film genre)

Parallel cinema[edit]
Main article: Parallel Cinema
Parallel Cinema, also known as Art Cinema or the Indian New Wave, is a specific movement in Indian cinema, known for its serious content of realism and naturalism, with a keen eye on the social-political climate of the times. This movement is distinct from mainstream Bollywood cinema and began around the same time as the French New Wave and Japanese New Wave. The movement was initially led by Bengali cinema (which has produced internationally acclaimed filmmakers such as Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, and Ritwik Ghatak) and then gained prominence in the other film industries of India. Some of the films in this movement have garnered commercial success, successfully straddling art and commercial cinema. An early example of this was Bimal Roy's Do Bigha Zamin (1953), which was both a commercial and critical success, winning the International Prize at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. The film's success paved the way for the Indian New Wave.[81][82][304]
The neo-realist filmmakers were the Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray, closely followed by Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Shyam Benegal, Shaji N.Karun, Adoor Gopalakrishnan[75] and Girish Kasaravalli[305] Ray's films include The Apu Trilogy, consisting of Pather Panchali (1955), Aparajito (1956) and The World of Apu (1959).

Music in Indian cinema is a substantial revenue generator, with the music rights alone accounting for 4–5% of the net revenues generated by a film in India.[34] The major film music companies of India are Saregama and Sony Music.[34] Commercially, film music accounts for 48% India's net music sales.[34] A typical Indian film may have around 5–6 choreographed songs spread throughout the film's length.[311]
The demands of a multicultural, increasingly globalized Indian audience often led to a mixing of various local and international musical traditions.[311] Local dance and music nevertheless remain a time tested and recurring theme in India and have made their way outside of India's borders with its diaspora.[311] Playback singers such as Mohammad Rafi,kishore kumar,Lata Mangeshkar, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, Yesudas drew large crowds with national and international film music stage shows.[311] The end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st saw extensive interaction between artists from India and the western world.[312] Artists from Indian diaspora blended the traditions of their heritage to those of their country to give rise to popular contemporary music.[312]
Film location in India[edit]
In filmmaking, a location is any place where a film crew will be filming actors and recording their dialog. A location where dialog is not recorded may be considered as a second unit photography site. Filmmakers often choose to shoot on location because they believe that greater realism can be achieved in a "real" place, however location shooting is also often motivated by the film's budget.
The most popular locations for film shooting in India are typically the centres of Indian cinema - Mumbai for Hindi and Marathi cinema, Kochi for Malayalam cinema, Chennai for Tamil cinema, Hyderabad for Telugu cinema, Calcutta for Bengali cinema, Bangalore for Kannada cinema, and so on. Apart from these there are several national locations which are prominently used by Indian filmmakers. These include Manali and Shimla in Himachal Pradesh, Srinagar and Ladakh in Jammu & Kashmir, Lucknow, Agra and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Ooty in Tamil Nadu, Amritsar in Punjab, Darjeeling in West Bengal, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Jaipur in Rajasthan, Delhi, Kerala and Goa.[313][314]
