For other uses, see Aggregate (disambiguation).
In statistics, aggregate data are data combined from several measurements. When data are aggregated, groups of observations are replaced with summary statistics based on those observations.[1]
In a data warehouse, the use of aggregate data dramatically reduces the time to query large sets of data. Developers pre-summarize queries that are regularly used, such as Weekly Sales across several dimensions such as by item hierarchy or geographical hierarchy.
In economics, aggregate data or data aggregates are high-level data that are composed from a multitude or combination of other more individual data, such as:

in macroeconomics, data such as the overall price level or overall inflation rate; and
in microeconomics, data of an entire sector of an economy composed of many firms, or of all households in a city or region.
