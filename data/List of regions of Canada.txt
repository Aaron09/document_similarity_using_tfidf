The list of regions of Canada is a summary of geographical areas on a hierarchy that ranges from national (groups of provinces and territories) at the top to local regions and sub-regions of provinces at the bottom. Administrative regions that rank below a province and above a municipality are also included if they have a comprehensive range of functions compared to the limited functions of specialized government agencies. Some provinces and groups of provinces are also quasi-administrative regions at the federal level for purposes such as representation in the Senate of Canada. However regional municipalities (or regional districts in British Columbia) are included with local municipalities in the article List of municipalities in Canada.

National regions[edit]
Although most of these regions have no official status or defined boundaries the Provinces and territories are sometimes informally grouped into regions (generally from west to east by Provinces, followed by the three Territories). Seats in the Senate are equally divided among four regions: Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario, and the West, with special status for Newfoundland and Labrador, and Northern Canada ('the North'). These are the only national regions that have any official status. Regional representation on the Supreme Court of Canada is based on the standard six-region model and is governed more by convention than by law. Quebec is the only region with a legally guaranteed quota of three judges on the bench. The other regions are usually represented by three judges from Ontario and one each from British Columbia, the Prairie provinces, and the Atlantic provinces. The three territories do not have any separate representation on the supreme court.

Inter-provincial regions[edit]
An inter-provincial region includes more than one province but doesn't usually include the entirety of each province or territory in the group. However, the geographic features that characterize this type of region can sometimes lead to the relevant provinces or territories being seen seen as regional groups like British Columbia-Yukon and Alberta-Northwest Territories.

French Canada, centered in Quebec but has scattered populations in Manitoba, Ontario, and the Maritime provinces.
English Canada, sometimes known as the Rest of Canada (excluding Quebec) when considering topics of language

Canadian Shield, a vast region centered around Hudson Bay that includes parts of every province except British Columbia and the Maritimes, and every territory except Yukon.
Acadia that links parts of the Maritimes and parts of eastern Quebec.
Quebec City–Windsor Corridor that links southern Ontario with southern Quebec.

National Capital Region, a federal administrative region that straddles the Ottawa River on the Ontario-Quebec border and includes the cities of Ottawa and Gatineau. It is also part of the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor.


Palliser's Triangle that links the main agricultural regions of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. It is roughly co-terminus with the grasslands of the Canadian Prairies.

Cypress Hills that links the hilly areas of southern Alberta with their counterparts in southern Saskatchewan. The Cypress Hills are also part of Palliser's Triangle.


Mackenzie River Valley which includes the Peace River Country of northern Alberta and northeastern British Columbia and the Mackenzie-Slave-Athabaska river system in the Northwest Territories. They combine into a single large valley region that occupies much of the combined inter-provincial region. Some mountainous areas of British Columbia and Yukon are technically part of the watershed but are not generally considered part of the valley region.
Canadian Rockies which link most of British Columbia and Yukon Territory into a single mountainous region.



Provincial regions[edit]
The provinces and territories are nearly all sub-divided into regions for a variety of official and unofficial purposes. The geographic regions are largely unofficial (and therefore somewhat open to interpretation). The largest provinces can be divided into a number of primary geographic regions of comparatively large size (e.g. southern Ontario), and subdivided into a greater number of smaller secondary regions (e.g. southwestern Ontario). In geographically diverse provinces, the secondary regions can be further subdivided into numerous local regions and even sub-regions. British Columbia has a much greater number of local regions and sub-regions than the other provinces and territories due to its mountainous terrain where almost every populated lake, sound, and river valley, and every populated cape and cluster of small islands can claim a distinct geographical identity. At the other extreme, Prince Edward Island is not divided into any widely recognized geographic regions or sub-regions because of its very small size and lack of large rivers or rugged terrain. New Brunswick's small size renders it dividable into local geographic region only.
In Quebec, Nunavut, and the Northwest Territories, the regions have been officially defined by their respective governments for supra-municipal administrative purposes. Most of these jurisdictions are smaller in land area than the primary geographic regions in other provinces, so they have been listed here as equivalent to secondary regions.
