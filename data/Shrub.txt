A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. Unlike herbs, shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground. They are distinguished from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, and are usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall.[1] Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed "subshrubs".[2]

Use in parks[edit]
An area of cultivated shrubs in a park or a garden is known as a shrubbery.[3] When clipped as topiary, suitable species or varieties of shrubs develop dense foliage and many small leafy branches growing close together.[4] Many shrubs respond well to renewal pruning, in which hard cutting back to a "stool" results in long new stems known as "canes".[clarification needed] Other shrubs respond better to selective pruning to reveal their structure and character.
Shrubs in common garden practice are generally considered broad-leaved plants, though some smaller conifers such as mountain pine and common juniper are also shrubby in structure. Species that grow into a shrubby habit may be either deciduous or evergreen.[5]
Botanical structure[edit]

Shrub vegetation (with some cactus) in Webb County, Texas.


In botany and ecology, a shrub is more specifically used to describe the particular physical structural or plant life-form of woody plants which are less than 8 metres (26 ft) high and usually have many stems arising at or near the base.
For example, a descriptive system widely adopted in Australia is based on structural characteristics based on life-form, plus the height and amount of foliage cover of the tallest layer or dominant species.[6]
For shrubs 2–8 metres (6.6–26.2 ft) high the following structural forms are categorized:

dense foliage cover (70–100%) — closed-shrub
mid-dense foliage cover (30–70%) — open-shrub
sparse foliage cover (10–30%) — tall shrubland
very sparse foliage cover (<10%) — tall open shrubland

For shrubs less than 2 metres (6.6 ft) high the following structural forms are categorized:

dense foliage cover (70–100%) — closed-heath or closed low shrubland—(North America)
mid-dense foliage cover (30–70%) — open-heath or mid-dense low shrubland—(North America)
sparse foliage cover (10–30%) — low shrubland
very sparse foliage cover (<10%) — low open shrubland
