The liberalisation of Bangladesh's telecommunications sector began with small steps in 1989 with the issuance of a licence to a private operator for the provision of inter alia cellular mobile services to compete with Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB), the previous monopoly provider of telecommunications services within Bangladesh. Significant changes in the number of fixed and mobile services deployed in Bangladesh occurred in the late 1990s and the number of services in operation have subsequently grown exponentially in the past five years.
The incentives both from government and public sectors have helped the industry grow and it is now one of the biggest industries in Bangladesh. As a populous country, its huge market has attracted many foreign investors.

Bangladesh Telecom Network Topology


As defined in the National Telecommunications Policy 1998 and International Long Distance Telecommunications Services (ILDTS) Policy 2007, all mobile operators is to interconnect through Interconnection Exchange (ICX) and all international calls to be handled by International Gateway (IGW) which is to be connected to the mobile and fixed operators through the ICXs.
The Interconnection Exchange (ICX) will receive all calls from the mobile and fixed operators whenever the call is made to other network and will pass it to the destination network if the call is local, and will pass to the IGWs if the call is international. ICX will also deliver calls received from IGWs where the call is destined.[4]
Below illustrate the structure of interconnection between different interfaces.

Main article: Television in Bangladesh
As of 2012 there are 23 broadcast television stations in Bangladesh, including the state-run BTV and BTV World, with 20 million television sets in the country.
The number of private satellite channels is growing. The first private channel in Bangladesh was ATN Bangla. There are 5 full-fledged news channels (Somoy TV, ATN News, Independent Television, Ekattor TV and Jamuna TV). Gaan Bangla, the first full-time music channel in Bangladesh, commenced operations by October 2013.
Internet[edit]
Main article: Internet in Bangladesh
The first connectivity in Bangladesh with the internet was in 1996. Though it was somewhat late, over the past few years growth has been rapid. The government's high internet tariff is impeding the growth of this sector.[citation needed] Recently the government has decided to reduce the tariff 50%.[10]
The internet country code of Bangladesh is .bd.
As of 2005 more than 180 Internet Service Providers are operating in the country.[11] ISP's are regulated by the Bangladesh telecommunication regulatory commission (BTRC).
The number of internet users in Bangladesh as of March 2009 is over 600,000, compared to 100,000 in 2000.[12] However, only 0.3% of the population use the internet, thus making Bangladesh the lowest usage percentage per population of the internet in the world with the exception of North Korea, Myanmar and Sierra Leone.[13]
In April 2010 Akhtaruzzaman Manju, president of the Internet Service Providers' Association of Bangladesh, told Xinhua that the country's six cell phone operators and Internet Service Providers have so far provided over 800,000 internet connections. "We've estimated that nearly 10 million people in the country are using 800,000 internet connections on a shared basis," he said, adding the number of internet users in the country is increasing yearly by around 15–16 percent.[14]
A 2009 study by the Boston Consulting Group found that the number of Internet subscribers in Bangladesh is likely to reach 18.3 million by the year 2020, equivalent to a 32 percent household Internet penetration, which will result in a 2.6 per cent contribution to the country’s GDP while creating 129,000 more jobs, the research added.[15]
Broadband Internet access[edit]
Though broadband internet access is available, the cost of high speed connection is higher than in other south Asian countries. Broadband internet and e-commerce in Bangladesh is slowly progressing. WiMAX service is now available from some internet service providers. In Bangladesh broadband is legally defined as 128/128 kbit/s, which is not in line with ITU standards.[16]
The ISPs currently providing broadband services in Bangladesh are:

Banglalion
Infocom Limited

International[edit]
There are 6 satellite earth stations. Talimabad, Betbunia are two of them. Some info shows that the number is now 7. Bangladesh will send its first ever satellite Bangabandhu-1 into space in 2017.
Submarine cables[edit]
Bangladesh is connected to SEA-ME-WE 4 or SMW-4 (South-East Asia – Middle East – Western Europe 4) and SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable systems. The landing site of the SMW-4 Bangladesh branch is located in Cox's Bazaar and the landing site of the SMW-5 Bangladesh branch is located in Kuakata. The two submarine cables provide the Country with Redundancy to support uninterrupted internet and long distance communications and also with a huge bandwidth. The company, BSCCL is the only submarine cable operator in Bangladesh.[17]
