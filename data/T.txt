History[edit]


Phoenician
Taw
Etruscan
T
Greek
Tau







Taw was the last letter of the Western Semitic and Hebrew alphabets. The sound value of Semitic Taw, Greek alphabet TŒ±œÖ (Tau), Old Italic and Latin T has remained fairly constant, representing [t] in each of these; and it has also kept its original basic shape in most of these alphabets.
Use in writing systems[edit]
English[edit]
In English, ‚ü®t‚ü© usually denotes the voiceless alveolar plosive (International Phonetic Alphabet and X-SAMPA: /t/), as in tart, tee, or ties, often with aspiration at the beginnings of words or before stressed vowels.
The digraph ‚ü®ti‚ü© often corresponds to the sound / É/ (a voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant) word-medially when followed by a vowel, as in nation, ratio, negotiation, and Croatia.
The letter ‚ü®t‚ü© corresponds to the affricate /tÕ° É/ in some words as a result of yod-coalescence (for example, in words ending in "-ture", such as future).
A common digraph is ‚ü®th‚ü©, which usually represents a dental fricative, but occasionally represents /t/ (as in Thomas and thyme.)
Other languages[edit]
In the orthographies of other languages, ‚ü®t‚ü© is often used for /t/, the voiceless dental plosive /tÃ™/ or similar sounds.
Other systems[edit]
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, ‚ü®t‚ü© denotes the voiceless alveolar plosive.
