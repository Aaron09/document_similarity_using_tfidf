History[edit]
The DfE was formed on 12 May 2010 by the incoming Cameron ministry, taking on the responsibilities and resources of the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF).
In June 2012 the Department for Education committed a breach of the UK's Data Protection Act due to a security flaw on its website which made email addresses, passwords and comments of people responding to consultation documents available for download.[1]
In July 2016, the Department took over responsibilities for higher and further education and for apprenticeship from the dissolved Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.[2]

Agencies and public bodies[edit]
Agencies[edit]
Education and Skills Funding Agency[edit]
The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA)[9] was formed on 1 April 2017 following the merger of the Education Funding Agency and the Skills Funding Agency.[10] Previously the Education Funding Agency (EFA) was responsible for distributing funding for state education in England for 3-19 year olds, as well as managing the estates of schools, and colleges and the Skills Funding Agency was responsible for funding skills training for further education in England and running the National Apprenticeship Service and the National Careers Service. The EFA was formed on 1 April 2012 by bringing together the functions of two non-departmental public bodies, the Young People's Learning Agency and Partnerships for Schools.[11] The SFA was formed on 1 April 2010, following the closure of the Learning and Skills Council.[12] Peter Lauener is the agency's Chief Executive.[13]
National College for Teaching and Leadership[edit]
The National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) is responsible for administering the training of new and existing teachers in England, as well as the regulation of the teaching profession and offers headteachers, school leaders and senior children's services leaders opportunities for professional development. It was established on 1 April 2013, when the Teaching Agency (which replaced the Training and Development Agency for Schools and parts of the General Teaching Council for England) merged with the National College for School Leadership.
Standards and Testing Agency[edit]
The Standards and Testing Agency (STA) is responsible for developing and delivering all statutory assessments for school pupils in England.[14] It was formed on 1 October 2011 and took over the functions of the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency. The STA is regulated by the examinations regulator, Ofqual.[15]
Public bodies[edit]
The DfE is also supported by 10 public bodies:


Non-ministerial departments
Ofqual; Ofsted


Executive non-departmental public bodies
Equality and Human Rights Commission; Higher Education Funding Council for England; Office for Fair Access; Office of the Children's Commissioner; Student Loans Company


Advisory non-departmental public bodies
School Teachers' Review Body


Other
Government Equalities Office; Office of the Schools Adjudicator


Devolution[edit]
Education, youth and children's policy is devolved elsewhere in the UK. The department's main devolved counterparts are as follows:
Scotland

Scottish Government – Learning and Justice Directorates

Northern Ireland

Department of Education
Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (children and young people)[16]

Wales

Welsh Government – Department for Education and Skills[17]

National Curriculum 2014[edit]
The Department for Education released a new National Curriculum for schools in England for September 2014, which included 'Computing'.[18] Following Michael Gove's speech in 2012,[19] the subject of Information Communication Technology (ICT) has been disapplied and replaced by Computing. With the new curriculum, materials have been written by commercial companies, to support non-specialist teachers, for example, '100 Computing Lessons' by Scholastic. The Computing at Schools organisation[20] has created a 'Network of Teaching Excellence'[21] to support schools with the new curriculum.[dead link]
Post-16 area reviews[edit]
In 2015, the Department announced a major restructuring of the further education sector, through 37 area reviews of post-16 provision.[22] The proposals were criticised by NUS Vice President for Further Education Shakira Martin for not sufficiently taking into account the impact on learners;[23][24] the Sixth Form Colleges' Association similarly criticised the reviews for not directly including providers of post-16 education other than colleges, such as school and academy sixth forms and independent training providers.[25]
