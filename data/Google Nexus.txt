Google Nexus is a line of consumer electronic devices that run the Android operating system. Google manages the design, development, marketing, and support of these devices, but some development and all manufacturing are carried out by partnering with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). As of August 2016[update], the devices currently available in the line are two smartphones, the Nexus 6P (made with Huawei) and Nexus 5X (made with LG). The line has also included tablets and streaming media players, though neither type of device is currently available. The most recent tablet was the Nexus 9 (made with HTC), and the most recent streaming media player the Nexus Player (made with Asus).
Devices in the Nexus line[2] are considered Google's flagship Android products. They contain little to no manufacturer or wireless carrier modifications to Android (such as custom user interfaces[3]), although devices sold through carriers may be SIM locked and may bear some extra branding. Nexus 6 devices sold through AT&T, for example, are SIM locked and feature a custom boot splash screen and a logo on the back of the device, despite having otherwise identical hardware to the unlocked variant.[citation needed] The Verizon Galaxy Nexus featured a Verizon logo on the back and received software updates at a slower pace than the unlocked variant, though it featured different hardware to accommodate Verizon's CDMA network. All Nexus devices feature an unlockable bootloader[4] to allow further development and end-user modification.[5] Nexus devices are often among the first Android devices to receive updates to the operating system.[6][7][8]
With the expansion of the Google Pixel product line in late 2016, Google stated that they "don’t want to close a door completely, but there is no plan right now to do more Nexus devices."[9] In 2017 Google partnered with HMD Global in making new Nokia phones, which have been considered by some as a revival of Nexus.[10][11][12][13]
