This is a list of properties and historic districts in Oregon that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. There are listings in all of Oregon's 36 counties.
The National Register of Historic Places recognizes buildings, structures, objects, sites, and districts of national, state, or local historic significance across the United States.[1] Out of over 90,000 National Register sites nationwide,[2] Oregon is home to more than 2,000 NRHP listings.[3]
Over one-fourth of the NRHP listings in the state are found in Multnomah County. In turn, the large majority (over 90%) of Multnomah's NRHP sites are situated within the city of Portland.



This National Park Service list is complete through NPS recent listings posted December 22, 2017.[4]

Notes[edit]



^ These counts are based on entries in the National Register Information Database as of April 24, 2008 and new weekly listings posted since then on the National Register of Historic Places web site. There are frequent additions to the listings and occasional delistings and the counts here are approximate and not official. New entries are added to the official Register on a weekly basis. Also, the counts in this table exclude boundary increase and decrease listings which only modify the area covered by an existing property or district, although such increases and decreases carry a separate National Register reference number.
^ Several historic resources within Multnomah County are included on multiple area lists:

Portland Skidmore/Old Town Historic District: Northwest and Southwest Portland
Broadway Bridge: North and Northwest Portland
Burnside Bridge: Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest Portland
Morrison Bridge: Southeast and Southwest Portland
Hawthorne Bridge: Southeast and Southwest Portland


^ Several historic resources in Oregon, mostly of a linear nature, are included on multiple county lists:

Barlow Road: Clackamas, Hood River, and Wasco
Columbia River Highway Historic District: Hood River, Multnomah, and Wasco
Jacksonville-to-Fort Klamath Military Wagon Road: Jackson and Klamath
McKenzie Highway Historic District: Deschutes, Lane, and Linn
