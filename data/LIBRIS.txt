LIBRIS (Library Information System) is a Swedish national union catalogue maintained by the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm.[1] It is possible to freely search about 6.5 million titles nationwide.[2]
In addition to bibliographic records, one for each book or publication, LIBRIS also contains an authority file of people. For each person there is a record connecting name, birth and occupation with a unique identifier.[citation needed]
The MARC Code for the Swedish Union Catalog is SE-LIBR, normalized: selibr.[3]
The development of LIBRIS can be traced to the mid-1960s.[4] While rationalization of libraries had been an issue for two decades after World War II, it was in 1965 that a government committee published a report on the use of computers in research libraries.[5] The government budget of 1965 created a research library council (Forskningsbiblioteksrådet, FBR).[6] A preliminary design document, Biblioteksadministrativt Information System (BAIS) was published in May 1970, and the name LIBRIS, short for Library Information System, was used for a technical subcommittee that started on 1 July 1970.[7] The newsletter LIBRIS-meddelanden (ISSN 0348-1891) has been published since 1972[8] and is online since 1997.[9]
