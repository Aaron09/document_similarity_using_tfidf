^ a b The approximate counts are the best available. There are frequent additions to the listings, and occasional delistings, and the counts here may not be perfectly updated. Also, not counted are most boundary increase listings, which increase the area covered by a historic district and which carry a separate National Register reference number. An exception is Grand Central Terminal Park Avenue Viaduct which is treated here as a separate property, although it was added to the National Register as a boundary increase to the Grand Central Terminal.
