Telecommunications in Norway are relatively advanced. There are about as many cellular phone subscription as there are inhabitants in the country (4.7 million), while the number of fixed line telephone subscriptions is declining towards 2 million.[1] As of 2006, 79% of the population had access to internet at home, rising to 95% by 2012.[2][3]
Norway was the first non-English-speaking country on the net. In 1971 NORSAR (Norwegian Seismic Array) at Kjeller just outside Oslo was connected by satellite to the SDAC (Seismic Data Analysis Center) in Virginia, US as part of ARPANET[4] in order to monitor nuclear test-ban treaties with the Soviet Union.
