Congressional districts for the United States House of Representatives are electoral divisions for the purpose of electing members of the House of Representatives. The number of voting seats in the House of Representatives is currently set at 435, with each one representing approximately 711,000 people.[1] That number has applied since 1913, excluding a temporary increase to 437 after the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii. The total number of state members is capped by the Reapportionment Act of 1929.[2] In addition, each of the five inhabited U.S. territories and the federal district of Washington, D.C. sends a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives.
The Census Bureau conducts a constitutionally mandated decennial census whose figures are used to determine the number of congressional districts to which each state is entitled, in a process called "apportionment". For example, Nebraska had 6 districts until 1933 and only 3 following the 1960 census. The number of districts for Texas increased from 30 to 32 in 2002, and then to 36 in 2012 based on the 2010 census. Other states have lost districts. The 2012 elections were the first to be based on the congressional districts which were defined based on the 2010 census.[3]
Each state is responsible for the redistricting of districts within their state, and several states have one "at-large" division. Redistricting must take place if the number of members changes following a reapportionment, or may take place at any other time if, for example, demographics represented in a district has changed substantially. Districts may sometimes retain the same boundaries while changing their district numbers.
The following is a complete list of the 435 current congressional districts for the House of Representatives, and over 200 obsolete districts, and the six current and one obsolete non-voting delegations.
