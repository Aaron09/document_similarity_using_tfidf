Controversy[edit]
In October 2013, ARPT (Algeria Regulatory Authority for Post and Telecommunications) awarded 3G licences to the three mobile operators in Algeria: Mobilis, ooredoo Algeria and Djezzy. The mobile operator companies promised their clients better mobile internet service.
The ARPT imposed on mobile operators a 3G double numbering license. This double numbering system requires any citizen that wishes to use the 3G service, must hold two separate 2G and 3G mobile numbers.Having two numbers with two different mobile internet access is more expensive and inconvenient.

Anonymous involvement[edit]
In August 2012 a group in the Anonymous irc channel #OpAlgeria started an operation against the ARPT (Authorite postal et telecommunication). This operation was started because the ARPT made a decision to require authorization of its users before allowing them to use any kind of encryption (for example; IpSec). They also will require authorization for any type of virtual private network (VPN) technology (for example; PPTP, L2TP, GRE Tunneling, OpenVPN, and most other protocols that allow you protect your information).
