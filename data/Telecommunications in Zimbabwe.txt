Background[edit]
Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ) was established by the Postal and Telecommunications Act in 2000 and started its operations in March 2001. This legislation brought about a new institutional framework for telecommunications in Zimbabwe.
Telephone system[edit]
The phone system was once one of the best in Africa, but now suffers from poor maintenance; more than 100,000 outstanding requests for connection despite an equally large number of installed but unused main lines.
Main lines in use: 356,000 (2011)
The domestic system consists of microwave radio relay links, open-wire lines, radiotelephone communication stations, fixed wireless local loop installations, and a substantial mobile cellular network; Internet connection is available in most major towns that includes Harare,Gweru Bulawayo,Mutare through fiber optic and other remote parts through satellite communication
International: country code - 263; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat; two international digital gateway exchanges (in Harare and Gweru) (2010)
Mobile cellular: 9.2 million (2011)
Radio[edit]
Broadcast stations: AM 7, FM 4 (plus 17 repeater stations), shortwave 1. Acts as the primary communication for largely rural population. 2012 saw the launch of two independent stations ZiFM and Star FM.
As of 2013, Zimbabwean authorities have required all radio owners to obtain a "listening licence" from the state.[1]
Television[edit]
There are 2 state-controlled television stations—ZBC channels 1 and 2. The government has shut down and refuses to issue licenses to domestic independent broadcasters such as JoyTV in 2002. However satellite TV providers are available, in 2013 Zimbabwe saw the introduction of its first pay TV. In 2017, Kwesé TV a subsidiary of Econet Global which was founded by Zimbabwean entrepreneur Strive Masiyiwa has been delayed license to operate in Zimbabwe by the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) .
Market structure mobile[edit]
There are three GSM mobile network operators, namely Econet, Net One and Telecel. The current subscriber base in June 2011 to these three mobile operators were 5,521,000 people for Econet, 1,297,000 for Net One, and 1,349,000 for Telecel. All of these operators are 100 percent digitalized and offer 2G, GPRS, EDGE, 3G and 4G LTE services.
