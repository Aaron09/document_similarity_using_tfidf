Education[edit]
Henderson earned his B.Sc (1970) from the University of Winnipeg, followed by his M.A. and Ph.D.(1976) in Economics from UCLA.[4] Henderson's areas of scholarly interest include microeconomics, cost–benefit analysis, health economics, energy economics, and the economics of taxation.[5]
Career[edit]
A friend of economist Milton Friedman since they first met at the University of Chicago in 1970, Henderson took his advice to, “make politics an avocation, not a vocation,” pursuing a career course that led to earning a Ph.D. in economics.[6] Henderson first taught at the University of Rochester, Graduate School of Management, from 1975 to 1979. Next, he took a position at San Francisco-based Cato Institute from 1979-1980, and then a short stint at Santa Clara University from 1980 to 1981.[7] In 1982 Henderson joined President Reagan’s administration as a senior economist with the Council of Economic Advisers, serving as senior economist for health policy from 1982 to 1984 and then senior economist for energy policy from 1983 to 1984.[8] Henderson is one of the main economists blogging on socioeconomic issues at EconLog, along with Bryan Caplan, which The Wall Street Journal has designated as one of the top 25 economics blogs in the country.[9]
Henderson has written hundreds of articles for well-known publications as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Barron's, Fortune, The Freeman, The Public Interest, and The Christian Science Monitor. Henderson was the economics editor for the National Review the “Wartime Economist” for Antiwar.com and a contributing editor for Reason magazine[10] He is a Senior Fellow with the Vancouver-based Fraser Institute.[11] He has appeared on C-SPAN, The O’Reilly Factor, CNN, MSNBC, RT,[12] the Jim Lehrer Newshour and the John Stossel TV show, along with numerous radio shows and interviews with the BBC, KQED-FM, NPR and local radio affiliates. Henderson has travelled to Washington D.C. to testify before the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. A number of his research articles have appeared in scholarly journals, including Journal of Monetary Economics, The Independent Review, Cato Journal, Regulation, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, The Energy Journal , and Contemporary Economic Policy. A number of his books have been translated into Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Russian.
