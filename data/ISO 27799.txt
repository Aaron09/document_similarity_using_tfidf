The ISO/IEC 27000-series (also known as the 'ISMS Family of Standards' or 'ISO27k' for short) comprises information security standards published jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).[1]
The series provides best practice recommendations on information security management - the management of information risks through information security controls - within the context of an overall Information security management system (ISMS), similar in design to management systems for quality assurance (the ISO 9000 series), environmental protection (the ISO 14000 series) and other management systems.[2][3][4]
The series is deliberately broad in scope, covering more than just privacy, confidentiality and IT/technical/cybersecurity issues. It is applicable to organizations of all shapes and sizes. All organizations are encouraged to assess their information risks, then treat them (typically using information security controls) according to their needs, using the guidance and suggestions where relevant. Given the dynamic nature of information risk and security, the ISMS concept incorporates continuous feedback and improvement activities to respond to changes in the threats, vulnerabilities or impacts of incidents.
The standards are the product of ISO/IEC JTC1 (Joint Technical Committee 1) SC27 (Subcommittee 27), an international body that meets in person twice a year.
The ISO/IEC standards are sold directly by ISO, mostly in English, French and Chinese. Sales outlets associated with various national standards bodies also sell directly translated versions in other languages.

Early history[edit]
Many people and organisations are involved in the development and maintenance of the ISO27k standards. The first standard in this series was ISO/IEC 17799:2000; this was a fast-tracking of the existing British standard BS 7799 part 1:1999[5] The initial release of BS 7799 was based, in part, on an information security policy manual developed by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1993, what was then the Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom) convened a team to review existing practice in information security, with the goal of producing a standards document. In 1995, the BSI Group published the first version of BS 7799.[6] One of the principal authors of BS 7799 recalls that, at the beginning of 1993, "The DTI decided to quickly assemble a group of industry representatives from seven different sectors: Shell ([David Lacey] and Les Riley), BOC Group (Neil Twist), BT (Dennis Willets), Marks & Spencer (Steve Jones), Midland Bank (Richard Hackworth), Nationwide (John Bowles) and Unilever (Rolf Moulton)."[7] David Lacey credits Donn B. Parker as having the "original idea of establishing a set of information security controls", and with producing a document containing a "collection of around a hundred baseline controls" by the late 1980s for "the I-4 Information Security circle[8] which he conceived and founded."
Published standards[edit]
The published ISO27k standards related to "information technology - security techniques" are:

ISO/IEC 27000 — Information security management systems — Overview and vocabulary[9]
ISO/IEC 27001 — Information technology - Security Techniques - Information security management systems — Requirements. The 2013 release of the standard specifies an information security management system in the same formalized, structured and succinct manner as other ISO standards specify other kinds of management systems.
ISO/IEC 27002 — Code of practice for information security management - essentially a detailed catalog of information security controls that might be managed through the ISMS
ISO/IEC 27003 — Information security management system implementation guidance
ISO/IEC 27004 — Information security management — Monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation[10]
ISO/IEC 27005 — Information security risk management[11]
ISO/IEC 27006 — Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of information security management systems
ISO/IEC 27007 — Guidelines for information security management systems auditing (focused on auditing the management system)
ISO/IEC TR 27008 — Guidance for auditors on ISMS controls (focused on auditing the information security controls)
ISO/IEC 27009 — Essentially an internal document for the committee developing sector/industry-specific variants or implementation guidelines for the ISO27k standards
ISO/IEC 27010 — Information security management for inter-sector and inter-organizational communications
ISO/IEC 27011 — Information security management guidelines for telecommunications organizations based on ISO/IEC 27002
ISO/IEC 27013 — Guideline on the integrated implementation of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000-1 (derived from ITIL)
ISO/IEC 27014 — Information security governance.[12] Mahncke assessed this standard in the context of Australian e-health.[13]
ISO/IEC TR 27015 — Information security management guidelines for financial services
