The Indonesian archipelago geographically stretches across four time zones from UTC+6 in Aceh to UTC+9 in Western Papua. However, The Indonesian government only recognizes three time zones in its territory:

Indonesia Western Time—seven hours in advance (UTC+7) of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
Indonesia Central Time— eight hours ahead (UTC+8) of GMT; and
Indonesia Eastern Time—nine hours ahead (UTC+9) of GMT

The boundary between the western and central time zones established is a line running north between Java and Bali through the center of Kalimantan. The border between central and eastern time zones runs north from the eastern tip of Timor to the eastern tip of Sulawesi.
Daylight saving time is not currently observed in almost all of Indonesia due to its tropical location, resulting in those areas using their respective time zone all year long. The only unofficial exception of this is Muara Teweh and Maurainu, which unofficially uses Western Indonesian Daylight Time.
