History[edit]
CNET originally acquired the domain name (among other generic domain names like news.com, radio.com, etc.) in the mid-1990s to host a website for the company's technology-related TV shows. One of these shows was titled TV.com. The program, highlighting the best of the Internet for new and casual computer users, aired in U.S. syndication.[citation needed]
CNET acquired in 2006 TV Tome, a fan-run television database.[3] TV.com was launched a few months after that acquisition on June 1, 2005.[4] Many of the features and content from the original TV Tome site were maintained in the new TV.com site.[citation needed]
On May 15, 2008, CBS formally announced its purchase of CNET Networks,[5] and the company changed its name to CBS Interactive.
TV.com continually looked at innovating the television-viewing experience by incorporating it with technology, as seen with the creation of WatchList.[6] This service offered personalized TV listings influenced by user actions and social media, which eventually carried over to the creation of TV.com Relay.[citation needed]

TV Tome was an American website devoted to documenting English-language television shows and their production. It was run by volunteer editors, with the assistance of user contributions. The site was founded by John Nestoriak III.
The site had over 2,500 complete television series guides, over 3,500 developing television series guides, and filmographies for 250,000 actors and crew members moderated by a five-member crew. In addition to the television series guides, TV Tome had a forum for each television series, with information regarding episodes, their interpretation, and general discussions.
A spin-off site, Movie Tome, was established in August 2003. A video game tome and a music tome were originally planned as well, but such plans were abandoned with the purchase of TV Tome and Movie Tome by CNET (see below).
On April 22, 2005, TV Tome officially announced its acquisition by CNET.[3] CNET reportedly bought TV Tome for US$5 million in January 2005.[citation needed] CNET announced plans to relocate the site to its TV.com domain, which was acquired in 1996 for use in conjunction with the short-lived syndicated television series of the same name. A preliminary version of the new site launched on June 1, 2005 and on June 13, 2005, the site was permanently redirected to TV.com with an entirely new layout.
