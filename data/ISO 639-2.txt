ISO 639-2:1998, Codes for the representation of names of languages — Part 2: Alpha-3 code, is the second part of the ISO 639 standard, which lists codes for the representation of the names of languages. The three-letter codes given for each language in this part of the standard are referred to as "Alpha-3" codes. There are 464 entries in the list of ISO 639-2 codes.
The US Library of Congress is the registration authority for ISO 639-2 (referred to as ISO 639-2/RA). As registration authority, the LOC receives and reviews proposed changes; they also have representation on the ISO 639-RA Joint Advisory Committee responsible for maintaining the ISO 639 code tables.

History and relationship to other ISO 639 standards[edit]
Work was begun on the ISO 639-2 standard in 1989, because the ISO 639-1 standard, which uses only two-letter codes for languages, is not able to accommodate a sufficient number of languages. The ISO 639-2 standard was first released in 1998.
In practice, ISO 639-2 has largely been superseded by ISO 639-3 (2007), which includes codes for all the individual languages in ISO 639-2 plus many more. It also includes the special and reserved codes, and is designed not to conflict with ISO 639-2. ISO 639-3, however, does not include any of the collective languages in ISO 639-2; most of these are included in ISO 639-5.
B and T codes[edit]
While most languages are given one code by the standard, twenty of the languages described have two three-letter codes, a "bibliographic" code (ISO 639-2/B), which is derived from the English name for the language and was a necessary legacy feature, and a "terminological" code (ISO 639-2/T), which is derived from the native name for the language and resembles the language's two-letter code in ISO 639-1. There were originally 22 B codes; scc and scr are now deprecated.
In general the T codes are favored; ISO 639-3 uses ISO 639-2/T. However, ISO 15924 derives its codes from ISO 639-2/B when possible.
Scopes and types[edit]
The codes in ISO 639-2 have a variety of "scopes of denotation", or types of meaning and use, some of which are described in more detail below.

Individual languages
Macrolanguages (see ISO 639 macrolanguage)
Collections of languages
Dialects
Reserved for local use
Special situations

Individual languages are further classified as to type:

Living languages
Extinct languages
Ancient languages
Historic languages
Constructed languages


Collections of languages[edit]
Some ISO 639-2 codes that are commonly used for languages do not precisely represent a particular language or some related languages (as the above macrolanguages). They are regarded as collective language codes and are excluded from ISO 639-3. For a definition of macrolanguages and collective languages see [1].
The collective language codes in ISO 639-2 are listed below.
The following two codes are identified as collective codes in ISO 639-2 but are (at present) missing from ISO 639-5:

bih Bihari (has the ISO 639-1 code bh)
him Himachali

Reserved for local use[edit]
The interval from qaa to qtz is 'reserved for local use' and is not used in ISO 639-2 nor in ISO 639-3. These codes are typically used privately for languages not (yet) in either standard.
Special situations[edit]
There are four generic codes for special situations:

mis is listed as "uncoded languages" (originally an abbreviation for "miscellaneous")
mul (for multiple languages) is applied when several languages are used and it is not practical to specify all the appropriate language codes
und (for undetermined) is used in situations in which a language or languages must be indicated but the language cannot be identified.
zxx is listed in the code list as "no linguistic content", e.g. animal sounds (added 2006-01-11)

These four codes are also used in ISO 639-3.
