Elementary school is a school for students in their first school years, where they get primary education before they enter secondary education. The exact ages vary by country. In the United States, elementary schools usually have 6 grades with pupils aged between 6 and 12, but the age ranges 6 to 10 and 6 to 14 also exist.[1] In Japan, the age of pupils in elementary school ranges from 6 to 12, after which the pupils enter junior high school.
Elementary school is usually only one part of compulsory education, especially in Western countries.
