ISO 8000 is the global standard for Data Quality and Enterprise Master Data. It describes the features and defines the requirements for Master Data Quality and the Portability of Enterprise Master Data. The concept of Master Data is unique to each organization. It is commonly used to manage critical business information about products, services and materials, constituents, clients and counterparties, and for certain transactional and operational records. Practitioners often describe Master Data as "slowly changing facts" about critical business information.
The ISO 8000 standard was first proposed in 2002, and the first components were approved in 2009. Part 115, which describes "Quality Identifier Prefixes" for "Quality Identifiers," was most recently approved on October 24, 2017. Several important enhancements are currently under development. The core elements of the standard are quickly being adopted by many Fortune 500 corporations and certain public agencies involved in the regulation and supervision of financial and commodities markets around the world.
ISO 8000 is one of the emerging technology standards that large and complex organizations are turning to in order to improve business processes and control operational costs. The standard is in the process of being published as a number of separate documents, which ISO calls "parts".
ISO 8000 is being developed by ISO technical committee TC 184, Automation systems and integration, sub-committee SC 4, Industrial data. Like other ISO and IEC standards, ISO 8000 is copyrighted and is not freely available.[1]

Key Concepts[edit]
Master Data: Master data represents the business objects which are agreed on and shared across the enterprise. It can cover relatively static reference data, transactional, unstructured, analytical, hierarchical and metadata. It is the primary focus of the discipline of Master Data Management (MDM). This discipline used to be predominantly taken care of by Information Technology (IT) departments but can equally well be justified as a business function, with IT providing the required technology.
Quality Identifier: A Quality Identifier is an internal product or services identifier or key that is issued and "owned" by an organization and used to resolve a product or service to the minimum ISO 8000 quality data set required to validate the identifier.
Quality Identifier Prefix: An ISO 8000-115 Quality Identifier Prefix (QUIP) is a unique name or alpha-numeric character string that is used by manufacturers and distributors to uniquely identify products and replacements parts and link them to corresponding ISO Technical Specifications (ISO/TS).
Authoritative Legal Entity Identifier - An ALEI is an identifier issued by the administrative agency for the governing body of a nation, state, or community for a physical or juridical person for which they have granted legal status.
Authoritative Item Identifier - An AII is a primary key or system identifier for a product or service that is defined in a dictionary and in an ISO 22745 XML specification in standard format that uses property or attribute value pairs for the item characteristics.
Portability - Data portability is achieved when data is formatted using an agreed and known syntax and when the semantic encoding of the content is explicit. ISO
