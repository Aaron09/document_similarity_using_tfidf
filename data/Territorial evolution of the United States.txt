The United States of America was created on July 4, 1776, with the declaration of independence of thirteen British colonies. Their independence was recognized by Great Britain with the Treaty of Paris of 1783, following the American Revolutionary War. This effectively doubled the size of the colonies, now able to stretch west past the Proclamation Line to the Mississippi River. This land was organized into territories and then states, though there remained some conflict with the sea-to-sea grants claimed by some of the original colonies. In time, these grants were ceded to the federal government.
The first great expansion of the country came with the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, which doubled the country's territory, but brought it into minor conflict with the colonies of Spain which eventually resulted in the acquisition of Spanish Florida.[1] The Oregon Country gave the United States access to the Pacific Ocean, though it was shared for a time with the United Kingdom.[2] The annexation of the Republic of Texas in 1845 led directly to the Mexican-American War, after which the victorious United States obtained Mexico's northwestern quarter, including what was quickly made the state of California.[3] However, as the development of the country moved west, the question of slavery became too much to ignore, as there was a struggle to keep the number of northern abolitionist states equal to the number of southern slave states, with vigorous debate over whether the new territories would allow slavery and events such as the Missouri Compromise and Bleeding Kansas. This came to a head in 1860 and 1861, when the governments of the southern states proclaimed their secession from the country and formed the Confederate States of America. The American Civil War led to the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865 and the eventual readmission of the states to the United States Congress.
The country's expansion beyond North America began in 1856 with the passage of the Guano Islands Act, causing many small and uninhabited, but economically important, islands in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea to be claimed.[4] Most of these claims were eventually abandoned due to competing claims from other countries or the guano having been mined out. The Pacific expansion culminated in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 and its annexation in 1898. Alaska, the last major acquisition in North America, was purchased from Russia in 1867.
Desires for expansion into Spanish territories like Cuba led to the Spanish-American War in 1898, in which the United States gained Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, and occupied Cuba for several years. While the other two remain territories, the Philippines became independent in 1946, after being a major theater of World War II. Following the war, many islands were entrusted to the U.S. by the United Nations,[5] and while some remain U.S. territories, the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau emerged from the trust territory as independent nations. The last major international change was the acquisition in 1904, and return to Panama in 1979, of the Panama Canal Zone, a region of American sovereignty to build and run the Panama Canal. The final cession of power over the region was made to Panama in 1999.
Regarding internal borders, while territories could shift wildly in size, once established a state has commonly remained within its borders, barring small changes due to river shifts. Only four states – Maine, Kentucky, Vermont, and West Virginia – have been created from land claimed by another state; all of the others were created from territories or directly from acquisitions. The last state of the contiguous United States, commonly called the "lower 48," was admitted in 1912; the fiftieth and most recent state was admitted in 1959.

Change Map


July 4, 1776
Thirteen colonies of the Kingdom of Great Britain in North America collectively declared their independence as the United States of America, though several colonies had already individually declared independence:[6]

The Colony of Connecticut, becoming the State of Connecticut
The Counties of New Castle, Kent, and Sussex, upon Delaware, commonly known as the Lower Counties of Delaware, which was Delaware Colony before their declaration of independence on June 15, 1776[7]
The Province of Georgia, becoming the State of Georgia
The Province of Maryland, becoming the State of Maryland
The Province of Massachusetts Bay, becoming the State of Massachusetts Bay
The State of New Hampshire, which was the Province of New Hampshire before their declaration of independence on June 15, 1776[8]
The Province of New Jersey, becoming the State of New Jersey
The Province of New York, becoming the State of New York
The Province of North Carolina, becoming the State of North Carolina; some believe the colony declared independence on May 20, 1775, but this is disputed
The Province of Pennsylvania, becoming the State of Pennsylvania
The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, commonly known as Rhode Island, which was the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations before declaring independence on May 4, 1776[9]
The Province of South Carolina, becoming the State of South Carolina
The Colony of Virginia, becoming the Commonwealth of Virginia

The capital was not specifically established; at the time, the Continental Congress met in Philadelphia.[10][11]
Many states had vaguely defined and surveyed borders; these are not noted as contested in the maps unless there was an active dispute. The borders of North Carolina were particularly poorly surveyed, its border with South Carolina having been done in several pieces, none of which truly matched the spirit of the charter,[12][13] and its border with Virginia was only surveyed roughly halfway inland from the sea.
Several northeastern states had overlapping claims: Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York all claimed land west of their borders, overlapping with each other and with a sizable claim by Virginia. Of the three, only Connecticut seriously pursued its claims, while Virginia is considered to have had the most legitimate claim to the vast northwest, dividing it into counties and maintaining some limited control.
The entirety of the new United States was claimed by Great Britain. Of particular note are Machias Seal Island and North Rock, two small islands off the northeast coast which remain disputed up to the present.



Disputes:




September 20, 1776
The Counties of New Castle, Kent, and Sussex, upon Delaware enacted a constitution, renaming itself the Delaware State.[14]



September 28, 1776
The State of Pennsylvania enacted a constitution, renaming itself the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.[15]
no change to map


December 20, 1776
To avoid British forces who were advancing on Philadelphia, the Continental Congress began meeting in Baltimore.[10][11]



January 15, 1777
The northeastern region of New York, known as the New Hampshire Grants, declared independence as New Connecticut.[16][17][18]
Disputes:




March 4, 1777
The Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia after the threat to it by British forces was ended.[10][11]



June 4, 1777
New Connecticut was renamed Vermont.[17]
Disputes:




September 27, 1777
The Continental Congress fled Philadelphia after the American defeat at the Battle of Brandywine, and briefly met in Lancaster, Pennsylvania[10][11]



September 30, 1777
The Continental Congress continued to move away from Philadelphia, settling in York, Pennsylvania.[10][11]



July 2, 1779
The Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia following British withdrawal.[10][11]



August 31, 1779
Virginia surrendered its claim to southwest Pennsylvania when the two states agreed to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward to five degrees west of the Delaware River, with the border turning north from there.[19][20]



March 1780
North Carolina and Virginia surveyed their border further inland. Virginia's survey reached to the Tennessee River, but North Carolina's only went as far as the Cumberland Gap, and as the two surveys were roughly two miles apart, this created a thin area claimed by both states. Since the dispute only technically went as far west as the Cumberland Gap, beyond that point North Carolina's line is faded to show that it was more an assumption, and beyond the Tennessee River both lines are faded. While the border was intended to follow parallel 36°30′ north, early surveying errors caused it to veer north of that, reaching a distance of seventeen miles off by the time it reached the Tennessee River.[21]



October 25, 1780
The State of Massachusetts Bay enacted a constitution, renaming itself the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.



March 1, 1781
The Articles of Confederation entered into force.[22]
no change to map


April 4, 1781
Vermont claimed what was called the "East Union," consisting of some towns in New Hampshire that wished to join with Vermont due to a concern that their state was focusing too much on its coastal region. Vermont never gained full control over the area.[18][23][24][25] The specific extent of the towns annexed is unknown, as township borders were often delineated only when a dispute arose; the map uses the maximal interpretation.
Disputes:



June 16, 1781
Vermont claimed what was called the "West Union," consisting of some towns in New York, mainly to counterbalance Vermont's attempt at eastward expansion. Vermont never gained full control over the area.[18][24][26][27] (The specific date this occurred is unclear; sources suggest June 16, June 26, and July 18).
Disputes:



February 22, 1782
Vermont abandoned its attempts to annex the East Union from New Hampshire and the West Union from New York.[18][25][27][28]
Disputes:



October 29, 1782
The federal government accepted the cession from New York of its western claims, which the state ceded on February 17, 1780. At its maximum interpretation, New York claimed an area bordered by Lake Erie, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan; to the Illinois, Mississippi, and Tennessee Rivers; and north along the Appalachian Mountains, ending at the border with Pennsylvania. It is unclear from where this claim came; many sources state that New York had surrendered it, but very few elaborate on how it was obtained. One source states that it was a cession by the Six Nations, who had conquered much of the region.[29] However, New York never seriously enforced these claims. The cession included the western tip of New York, the Erie Triangle, formed by moving the western border of New York to a line 20 miles east of Presque Isle on Lake Erie.[30][31]



December 30, 1782
The Congress of the Confederation declared that the land that Connecticut claimed in northern Pennsylvania was part of Pennsylvania, thus attempting to end the Pennamite–Yankee War.[32] The claim was an extension of Connecticut's northernmost and southernmost borders westward, skipping New Jersey and New York, though as Connecticut's northern border was a few miles north of Pennsylvania's northern border, a small sliver of New York was also claimed. While conflict would continue for some time, this was the end of the formal claim by Connecticut.



June 30, 1783
The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, and the Pennsylvania government reaction to it, caused the Congress of the Confederation to leave Philadelphia for Princeton.[10]



November 26, 1783
The Congress of the Confederation reconvened in Annapolis.[10]



March 1, 1784
Virginia ceded its claims northwest of the Ohio River to the federal government.[33][34] Connecticut continued to claim its western lands that had overlapped Virginia's cession.



May 12, 1784
Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States, ending its claim to the country,[35] though borders with Great Britain were poorly defined in several areas in the north of the country. The treaty ended the American Revolutionary War, though military action had largely ended after the Franco-American victory at Yorktown on October 19, 1781.
The Peace of Paris also involved treaties with France and Spain, with Great Britain ceding the Floridas to Spain. During their ownership of West Florida, the British had moved its border north, and the cession to Spain appeared to apply to the full extent of the British colony. However, the British-American treaty granted the extension of West Florida to the United States, where it enlarged Georgia south to the 31st parallel north, indicating that only the original definition of West Florida was to be ceded to Spain. The local Spanish governors also made a move to occupy forts along the Mississippi River, with claims to everything south of the Tennessee River; it is unknown how official or strong these claims were, and they are not mapped as they are in conflict with the other Spanish claim involving the border of West Florida.[36]

August 23, 1784
A region in central North Carolina, unhappy with the state's governance over the area, declared independence from the state as the State of Frankland.[37] The government of Frankland held some control over the area, and petitioned for statehood, receiving support from seven of the nine states required, but would only last a few years.[38]
Unofficial change:



November 1, 1784
The Congress of the Confederation moved for a short time to Trenton.[10]



January 11, 1785
The Congress of the Confederation moved to New York, and would settle there for five years.[10]



April 19, 1785
The federal government accepted the cession from Massachusetts of its extreme western claim, which consisted of a strip of land west of Lake Huron and the Detroit River, bounded on the north by a line extending west from roughly halfway north through New Hampshire, and on the south by a line extending from the southern border of Massachusetts' western half. The claim was never seriously enforced.[39]
Change on paper only:



June 1785
The State of Frankland was renamed the State of Franklin, to encourage Benjamin Franklin to endorse the state, though he declined.[38]
Unofficial change:



September 13, 1786
Connecticut surrendered its western claim to the federal government except for its Western Reserve, though it is unclear how much control they held over the ceded region;[40][41] like the claim to Pennsylvania, this was a western extension of Connecticut's northernmost and southernmost points.
Change on paper only:



December 16, 1786
Massachusetts surrendered its claim to western New York, though it is unclear if Massachusetts ever held control over the region, as the claim was to the "soil, not the sovereignty".[39] This land, which was the area west of a north-south line 82 miles west of where the Delaware River entered New York, was later known as the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. It is likely that Massachusetts also claimed the Erie Triangle, but since this treaty was directly with New York, and New York had already ceded it to the federal government, it is not marked as being ceded by Massachusetts on the map.
Change on paper only:



July 13, 1787
The Territory Northwest of the Ohio River, ceded earlier by Virginia, was organized and commonly became known as the Northwest Territory.[42]



August 9, 1787
South Carolina ceded its western claim to the federal government,[43] though it was a result of inaccurate geography and South Carolina never actually held claim to this land. The claim was of a strip of land between the border of North Carolina and the source of the Savannah River but, unknown at the time, the river originated in North Carolina. The eastern part of this cession would be given to Georgia in 1802, despite Georgia technically already having claim to the land.

Per the Residence Act, the Congress of the United States relocated to Philadelphia for ten years until a federal district was built and ready.[10][11][62]



March 4, 1791
Vermont, which had been considered part of New York despite acting independently since 1777, was admitted as the fourteenth state.[18][63]


Disputes:



March 30, 1791
The District of Columbia, a federal district planned to house the federal government by 1800, was formed from land ceded by Maryland and Virginia,[64][65] consisting of a 100 square mile diamond straddling the Potomac River. However, it was not yet given that name, being simply referred to as the federal district. In September 1791, the commissioners in charge of planning the city would term it the "Territory of Columbia", and various laws refer to a District of Columbia, but sometimes informally. The area does not appear to have been formally named "District of Columbia" until at least the organic act of 1871.[66] Since the name "Columbia" was used from very early on, and at least informally by the government, the map will use "District of Columbia" starting from this date.



March 3, 1792
Pennsylvania purchased the Erie Triangle from the federal government.[67]



June 1, 1792
The western half of Virginia, which the state had agreed in 1789 to cede to the federal government,[68] was admitted as the fifteenth state, Kentucky.[69][70]

Disputes:



June 1, 1796
The Southwest Territory was admitted as the sixteenth state, Tennessee.[59][75]



April 7, 1798
Due to the Yazoo Land Fraud, an act authorized President John Adams to appoint commissioners to negotiate with Georgia about ceding its western land. The act created Mississippi Territory from the southwestern quarter of Georgia in the region recently ceded by West Florida, while maintaining that Georgia still held rights over the territory.[76][77]



June 9, 1800
Connecticut ceded its Western Reserve to the federal government, which assigned it to the Northwest Territory.[78] The act doing so was passed in Congress on April 28, 1800, and Connecticut approved it on this date.[79]



July 4, 1800
Indiana Territory was organized from the Northwest Territory, west of a line from the mouth of the Kentucky River to Fort Recovery, and a line north from there.[80][81]



November 17, 1800
The Congress of the United States moved to Washington in the District of Columbia, now built and ready to be the capital.[10] This was two weeks before the December 1 date established in the Residence Act; President John Adams urged Congress to move early in hopes of securing enough Southern votes to be re-elected, though this failed.[82]



January 1, 1801
The Kingdom of Great Britain united with the Kingdom of Ireland, renaming itself the United Kingdom.[83]



February 27, 1801
The District of Columbia was organized.[65][84]

April 26, 1802
Georgia ceded its western half, known as the Yazoo Lands, to the federal government; this region was west of the Chattahoochie River up to its great bend (near West Point), then a line from there towards and past Nickajack. At the same time, the federal government ceded to Georgia the eastern portion of the land previously ceded by South Carolina, though in reality Georgia technically already held title to the land, as the description of the earlier cession was based on an erroneous understanding of geography.[85]



March 1, 1803
The southern half of the Northwest Territory, along with a thin sliver of Indiana Territory, was admitted as the seventeenth state, Ohio. The remainder of the Northwest Territory was transferred to Indiana Territory.[86][87] The western border was a line due north from the mouth of the Great Miami River to a point east from the southern tip of Lake Michigan. The federal description then said it should go east from there, whereas the Ohio Constitution stated it should intersect with the most northerly cape of Maumee Bay, essentially the western tip of Lake Erie. The confusion caused by these varying descriptions of the state's borders, combined with inaccurate knowledge of geography, as no one at the time knew just how far south Lake Michigan extended, would lead to the conflict over the Toledo Strip.



November 3, 1803
The border between Tennessee and Virginia was resurveyed and established, ending the dispute over that part of the border. The border between Kentucky and Tennessee, despite following the original survey, remained vaguely defined.[21][88]



1803–1818 (Purchase of Louisiana)[edit]

Event
Change Map


December 20, 1803
The United States purchased Louisiana from France. This is the date of the formal turnover in New Orleans; the purchase was completed on April 30, 1803.[89] The transfer would be recognized in St. Louis in Upper Louisiana on March 10, 1804, known as Three Flags Day.
The extent of what constituted Louisiana was disputed with Spain: the United States claimed the purchase included the part of West Florida west of the Perdido River, and the southwestern border with New Spain was disputed, as the United States claimed the Sabine River as the border, but Spain maintained it was the Calcasieu River and others.



Disputes:




1804
The "Southwick Jog" was transferred from Connecticut to Massachusetts, to put to rest long-standing disagreements over the border between the two states.[39]



March 27, 1804
The land between Tennessee and Mississippi Territory previously ceded by Georgia was assigned to Mississippi Territory.[77][90]



October 1, 1804
Orleans Territory was organized from the Louisiana Purchase south of the 33rd parallel north, with the remainder being designated the District of Louisiana and placed under the jurisdiction of Indiana Territory.[91][92]



June 30, 1805
Michigan Territory was organized from Indiana Territory, defined as north of a line east from the southern tip of Lake Michigan, and east of a line north from the lake's northern tip.[93][94] The southeastern portion of the border technically conflicted with the definition of Ohio, which claimed the Toledo Strip north of that line; however, the exact position of Lake Michigan was not yet known.



July 4, 1805
The District of Louisiana was organized as Louisiana Territory.[92][95]



March 1, 1809
Illinois Territory was organized from Indiana Territory, west of the Wabash River and a line north from Post Vincennes.[96][97]



September 26, 1810
The Republic of West Florida declared independence from Spain. It maintained some control over its territory.[98]
Disputes:



December 10, 1810
Armed forces led by William C. C. Claiborne took possession of the portion of West Florida west of the Pearl River, following a proclamation on October 27, 1810, by President James Madison to do so. The United States had considered the region part of the Louisiana Purchase, including the area which had revolted against Spanish Florida and formed the Republic of West Florida. Madison's proclamation stated that it was to be "taken as part" of Orleans Territory.[1][89][99] The land west of Mobile Bay to the Pearl River was occupied and annexed de facto by the military in 1811.[100]:2a(map)
Disputes:



April 30, 1812
Most of Orleans Territory was admitted as the eighteenth state, Louisiana. It was defined as the portion of the territory east of a line north from where the Sabine River crosses the 32nd parallel north, and west of the Mississippi and Iberville Rivers.[92][101] The remainder presumably became unorganized territory, as it had no definition for a while.



May 14, 1812
The claimed portion of West Florida east of the Pearl River was assigned to Mississippi Territory, though the area around Mobile Bay remained under the control of Spanish Florida.[77][102] The United States militarily occupied Mobile and the surrounding area up to the Perdido River in April 1813.



June 4, 1812
Since its name was now shared with the state of Louisiana, Louisiana Territory was renamed Missouri Territory.[103][104]



August 4, 1812
The remaining claimed portion of West Florida was added to Louisiana, following the assent of that state to an act passed by Congress on April 14, 1812.[105][106]



August 16, 1812
During the War of 1812, the garrison at Fort Detroit surrendered, leading the United Kingdom to occupy Detroit, the capital and population center of Michigan Territory.[107]
Disputes:



September 29, 1813
Fort Detroit was recaptured by American forces following the Battle of Lake Erie, regaining control over Michigan Territory.[107][108]
Disputes:



August 24, 1814
British forces capture and burn Washington, but are forced to withdraw the next day. The functions of the capital were only momentarily suspended, though President James Madison took refuge in Brookville, Maryland.[109]

December 11, 1816
The southern part of Indiana Territory, along with small parts of Illinois Territory and Michigan Territory, were admitted as the nineteenth state, Indiana. The state was defined as the territory north of the Ohio River and east of the Wabash River, but while the territory's line turned north at Post Vincennes, the state's border continued up the Wabash until it reached the point where a line drawn north from Post Vincennes would last intersect the river as it weaved back and forth. The northern border of the state was a line east from 10 miles north of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, until it reached the meridian that formed Ohio's western border. Thus, a very small portion of Indiana Territory was transferred to Illinois Territory around the Wabash, Indiana took its northern slice from Michigan Territory, and the remainder of Indiana Territory across Lake Michigan became unorganized territory.[81][110]



March 3, 1817
Alabama Territory was organized from the eastern half of Mississippi Territory.[111][112] Its western border was, from the north: the Tennessee River to Bear Creek (around today's Pickwick Lake); a line from there to the northwestern corner of Washington County, Mississippi Territory; and a line south from there.



December 10, 1817
Mississippi Territory was admitted as the twentieth state, Mississippi.[77][113]



February 6, 1818
Alabama Territory created Tuskaloosa County with a description that inadvertently overlapped with Mississippi. It described the border of the county as running "a due west course to, the Tombeckbe river; thence up the same to the Cotton Gin Port".[114] Unknown at the time, the origin of the Tombigbee River and Cotton Gin Port were in Mississippi.

Per the terms of the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812, the United Kingdom returned Moose Island to Massachusetts, and the United States returned Campobello Island, Deer Island, and Grand Manan Island to the United Kingdom, all of which were captured from the other side during the war.[115]

December 3, 1818
The half of Illinois Territory south of the parallel 42°30′ north was admitted as the twenty-first state, Illinois. The remainder of the territory, along with the unorganized territory that was recently part of Indiana Territory, was assigned to Michigan Territory.[97][116]



1819–1845 (Northwest expansion)[edit]

Change Map


January 30, 1819
The Treaty of 1818 went into effect, setting the 49th parallel north as the border with the United Kingdom west of the Lake of the Woods, and also establishing the Oregon Country as a shared region with the United Kingdom.[2][117][118] Oregon Country had no defined northern limit, but it can be assumed that it did not encroach much upon Russian-held lands; this map uses the later-established line at the parallel 54°40′ north for simplicity.


Northwestern North America:



July 4, 1819
Arkansaw Territory was organized from Missouri Territory south of the parallel 36°30′ north.[119][120]



December 14, 1819
Alabama Territory was admitted as the twenty-second state, Alabama.[112][121] The statehood act provided for a survey of the southern part of the border with Mississippi for correction if it was discovered to encroach upon Mississippi's defined borders; it was later discovered to do so.



March 15, 1820
As part of the Missouri Compromise, the District of Maine, the northern and separate part of Massachusetts, was admitted as the twenty-third state, Maine.[122][123]



April 21, 1820
This is the earliest known date of the name "Arkansas Territory" being officially used instead of "Arkansaw Territory".[124]



May 12, 1820
The border between Kentucky and Tennessee was established. To make up for the fact that the border between the Cumberland Gap and the Tennessee River veered north as much as 17 miles from 36°30′ north, a new survey was conducted starting at that point on the Mississippi River and moving east to the Tennessee River, hence granting Kentucky an addition in its southwest.[21]



July 19, 1820
The overlap of the longitudinal southern border between Alabama and Mississippi was resolved, as per the act admitting Alabama as a state, because the provisional border encroached on Mississippi.[125][126] As the result of a survey, the southern border terminus was moved about 3.8 miles to the east, which changed the border up to the then-northwest corner of Alabama's Washington County. The date when this happened is unclear; the sources available give either an unpublished report dated May 29, 1820, or the completion of the demarcation of the new line on July 19, 1820.

December 19, 1820
Alabama redefined some county borders, ending its erroneous overlap of Mississippi created on February 6, 1818.[127]
Change on paper only:



February 22, 1821
The Adams–Onís Treaty with Spain took effect.[1] The many changes included:

The border with the holdings of Spain was concretely defined; previously, it had been the watershed of the Mississippi River and, for Oregon Country, the Columbia River, whereas now it followed specific rivers and parallels. The new border was defined as, starting in the south: The Sabine River to the 32nd parallel north, then north to the Red River of the South, following that to the 100th meridian west, then north to the Arkansas River to its source, then north from there to the 42nd parallel north and west to the ocean.
The new border placed the "Neutral Ground" in Louisiana.
Florida was ceded to the United States, although the formal transfer would not happen until July.
Arkansas Territory had created Miller County south of the Red River, and this area was now on the Spanish side of the border. However, as this was a change made solely by the territory, and not by the federal government, in this map it is considered a domestic dispute.
With Spanish West Florida being ceded, the dispute between it and Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi was resolved.




Disputes:



July 10, 1821
East Florida was formally transferred to the United States by Spain.[128]



July 17, 1821
West Florida was formally transferred to the United States by Spain.[128]



August 10, 1821
The southeastern corner of Missouri Territory was admitted as the twenty-fourth state, Missouri, the rest becoming unorganized territory.[104][129] It was defined as the area south of a line west from the Des Moines Rapids, and east of a line south from the mouth of the Kansas River.



March 30, 1822
The former East Florida and West Florida were organized as Florida Territory.[130][131]



May 26, 1824
The western half of Arkansas Territory, bordered by a line south from a point 40 miles west of Missouri's western border, was returned to unorganized territory.[120][132]



January 12, 1825
A treaty with the Russian Empire established the parallel 54°40′ north as the northern border of Oregon Country for American purposes; a separate treaty created the same border between Russia and the United Kingdom.[133] As this was likely the de facto border anyway, the region is already mapped with this line.

May 6, 1828
A treaty with the Cherokee moved the western border of Arkansas Territory, returning part of it to unorganized territory.[120][134] The new border was defined as starting from where the land of the Eastern Choctaw met the Red River of the South, then north from there to the mouth of the Arkansas River, and from there to the southwestern corner of Missouri.



July 9, 1832
The northernmost region of New Hampshire, which was disputed with the United Kingdom, declared independence as the Republic of Indian Stream.[135] While tiny, it does appear to have maintained some control over its territory.
Disputes:



June 28, 1834
Michigan Territory gained a large parcel of land from unorganized territory on its west, extending to the Missouri River.[94][136]



August 5, 1835
The Republic of Indian Stream recognized the jurisdiction of New Hampshire, thus ending its claimed independence. The date given is of a communication sent to British authorities;[137] other sources note a resolution passed by the citizens of Indian Stream on April 2, 1836.[135]
Disputes:



June 15, 1836
Arkansas Territory was admitted as the twenty-fifth state, Arkansas.[120][138]



July 3, 1836
Wisconsin Territory was organized from the western bulk of Michigan Territory.[139][140] The two large peninsulas between the Great Lakes remained in Michigan Territory; the upper peninsula was included in exchange for the territory abandoning its claim to the Toledo Strip. The territory initially rejected this plan, but would accept it on December 14.



December 14, 1836
Michigan Territory agreed to abandon its claim to the Toledo Strip, ending its dispute with Ohio.[141]



January 26, 1837
Michigan Territory was admitted as the twenty-sixth state, Michigan.[94][142]



March 28, 1837
The Platte Purchase transferred some land from unorganized territory to northwest Missouri, extending its northern border west to the Missouri River.[104][143]



July 3, 1838
Iowa Territory was organized from Wisconsin Territory west of the Mississippi River.[144][145]



February 11, 1839
Missouri claimed an area north of its border in Iowa Territory, initiating the long dispute known as the Honey War.[146]



May 21, 1840
Proper surveying was conducted along the border between Arkansas and Texas, and the area claimed by Arkansas for Miller County was held not to belong to Arkansas.[147]



November 10, 1842
The Webster–Ashburton Treaty defined the border with the United Kingdom east of the Rocky Mountains.[148][149] One source also mentions it very slightly altering the maritime boundary between Michigan and Wisconsin Territory.[150] The treaty resolved the disputes over the northern borders of Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin Territory.
The border between New York and Vermont on the one side, and the United Kingdom on the other, was clarified by the treaty. In 1816, construction began on an unnamed fort nicknamed "Fort Blunder" on a peninsula in Lake Champlain that, while south of the surveyed border, was discovered to be north of the 45th parallel north, which was the border set by the Treaty of Paris and thus in British territory. Consequently, construction on the fort was abandoned. The Webster–Ashburton Treaty specified that section of the border was to follow the surveyed line, rather than the exact parallel, thus moving the fort's area into the United States, and a new fort, Fort Montgomery, would be built on the spot in 1844.[151] As the earlier line was surveyed, even though it did not match the definition, it was deemed to be the legitimate border.

Local settlers created a provisional government for Oregon Country. While not official, it did maintain some jurisdiction over the area.[152]

December 29, 1845
The Republic of Texas was annexed and admitted as the twenty-eighth state, Texas.[154][155] Texas brought with it a substantial territorial dispute with Mexico. While many sources state that Mexico recognized the independence of the eastern portion of Texas, the treaties were rejected by the Mexican government. Texas formally handed over sovereignty to the United States in a ceremony on February 19, 1846.[156] The annexation led to the beginning of the Mexican–American War a few months later.[156]


Disputes:



June 15, 1846
The Oregon Treaty established the 49th parallel north west of the Lake of the Woods as the continental border (so it did not include Vancouver Island) with land held by the United Kingdom. The sharing of Oregon Country ended, and the United States portion became unorganized territory.[157]
The treaty was vague on which strait should be the border between Vancouver Island and the continent, thus causing a dispute over ownership of the San Juan Islands.[158] It specified "through the middle of the said channel and of Fuca Straits, to the Pacific Ocean".



Northwestern North America:


Disputes:



September 22, 1846
Following the capture on August 18, 1846, of Santa Fe, the capital of the Mexican territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo México,[159] a code of laws known as the Kearny Code was created for the area.[160][161] The region overlapped with Texas' claim, though Texas had little to no control over the area outside of its eastern quarter.
Unofficial change:



December 28, 1846
The southern portion of Iowa Territory, south of parallel 43°30′ north and east of the Big Sioux River, was admitted as the twenty-ninth state, Iowa. The remainder became unorganized territory.[145][162]



March 13, 1847
The District of Columbia retroceded Alexandria County back to Virginia.[65] Congress passed the act on July 9, 1846,[163] residents of Alexandria County were proclaimed by the president to have agreed to it on September 7, 1846,[164] and Virginia took possession of the land on this date.[165]



May 29, 1848
The southern bulk of Wisconsin Territory, mainly east of the St. Croix River, was admitted as the thirtieth state, Wisconsin. The remainder became unorganized territory.[140][166] However, the citizens of the remainder decided to continue on with a civil government, and even elected a delegate to the United States House of Representatives who would be seated on January 15, 1849, essentially making this region a de facto continuation of Wisconsin Territory.[167]



July 4, 1848
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican–American War and ceded a large parcel of land from Mexico, consisting of its territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México, and its claim to Texas.[168] Due to a disagreement over the southern border of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, a border dispute began.[169]


Disputes:



August 14, 1848
Oregon Territory was organized from the unorganized territory that was formerly part of Oregon Country.[170][171]



February 13, 1849
The boundary dispute between Iowa and Missouri known as the Honey War was resolved by the Supreme Court of the United States. The resulting border was the Sullivan Line that existed before the dispute, roughly splitting the two claims.[172]



March 3, 1849
Minnesota Territory was organized from unorganized territory east of the Missouri River and the region that had been operating as de facto Wisconsin Territory.[173][174]



March 12, 1849
A local government formed the State of Deseret and claimed a vast portion of the southwest, including most of the Mexican Cession. Though it petitioned to be admitted to the United States, the proposal was rejected and, in 1850, Utah Territory was formed instead.[175] The claimed area overlapped slightly with Texas' claimed area, as well as part of Oregon Territory.
Unofficial change:



September 9, 1850
The western portion of the Mexican Cession, west of the 120th meridian west, a diagonal line from where that intersects the 39th parallel north to where the Colorado River intersects the 35th parallel north, and the Colorado River, was admitted as the thirty-first state, California.[3][176] The portion of the remainder north of the 37th parallel north and west of the summit of the Rocky Mountains was organized as Utah Territory.[177][178] Part of Utah Territory overlapped with the portion of Texas that would be purchased on December 13, 1850, but the law authorizing the purchase was passed on this day, so the borders of Utah Territory assumed the purchase will go through.



December 9, 1850
The United Kingdom ceded less than one acre of underwater rock known as Horseshoe Reef in Lake Erie near Buffalo, New York for a lighthouse. It was surrounded by British waters, thus creating a form of enclave.[179]



December 13, 1850
The federal government purchased the western claims of Texas. New Mexico Territory was organized from the part of this land east of the Rio Grande, along with the remaining unorganized territory from the Mexican Cession.[180][181] New Mexico Territory included all of the area that had been governed under the Kearny Code.



April 5, 1851
The State of Deseret dissolved itself, its functions and territory largely having been superseded by Utah Territory.[182]
Unofficial change:



March 2, 1853
Washington Territory was organized from the half of Oregon Territory north of the 46th parallel north and the Columbia River.[183][184]



May 30, 1854
Kansas Territory was organized from unorganized territory north of the 37th parallel north, and Nebraska Territory was organized north of 40th parallel north.[185][186][187] Much of the remaining unorganized territory, east of the 100th meridian west, became known as Indian Territory, designated as a place to resettle Indian tribes.
A small strip between the Texas Panhandle and Kansas Territory was unclaimed, due to falling south of Kansas Territory's border but north of the 36°30′ latitude established in the Missouri Compromise as the northern limit of slavery, and thus Texas could not have it. This became known as the Public Land Strip, or sometimes "No Man's Land".[188]




June 30, 1854
The United States purchased a large parcel from Mexico known as the Gadsden Purchase, as it offered a much better route for a southern transcontinental railroad.[189] This resolved the border dispute, since the disputed land was included in the purchase.[169] The purchase was defined as: starting from where the Rio Grande crosses parallel 31° 47' north; then west 100 miles; then south to parallel 31° 20' north; then west to the 111th meridian west; then a line from there to a point on the Colorado River 20 miles below the mouth of the Gila River; and the Colorado River.


Disputes:



August 4, 1854
The recently obtained Gadsden Purchase was assigned to New Mexico Territory.[181][190]



January 11, 1855
Due to its remote location, Boston Corner was transferred from Massachusetts to New York.[191][192][193]



March 6, 1855
The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Florida in a boundary dispute with Georgia, setting the state boundary line along McNeil's line.[194]

A team of surveyors created the "Middleton Offset," a small notch in the border between Kentucky and Tennessee. It is unknown exactly why this was done.[197][198]



September 6, 1859
Johnston Atoll was claimed under the Guano Islands Act,[4] though it had been claimed by Hawaii in 1858.[199]
Pacific Ocean:



November 7, 1859
A local government was set up encompassing parts of the territories of Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah, and Washington, with the name of Jefferson Territory, bounded by the 37th and 43rd parallels north, and 102nd and 110th meridians west. While never recognized by the federal government, it generally held control over the area until Colorado Territory was established, which adopted most of its laws.[200]

In addition, Sarah Ann Island was claimed, which may have existed and would be sighted as late as 1917, but has since disappeared.[202]

A tiny portion of the Dakota Territory was erroneously left behind on the western side of Wyoming Territory.[259]

August 12, 1898
The Republic of Hawaii was annexed.[289] The ceremony to transfer sovereignty occurred on this date; the act was signed on July 7, 1898.[290] Johnston Atoll was not included with Hawaii, nor was Sikaiana Atoll, which had been ceded to Hawaii in 1856 by its residents and approved by King Kamehameha IV. However, the annexation was based on the islands named in a report of the Hawaiian Commission, which omitted Sikaiana.[291][292]

Guam, Porto Rico, and, after a payment of $20 million, the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish–American War.[294] The Philippines were claimed by the First Philippine Republic. The ceded region for the Philippines included the island of Palmas, which was administered by the Netherlands. This overlap would not be noticed until January 21, 1906.[295] While the United States occupied Cuba for a time, it was not ceded nor claimed.

Northwestern North America:



May 4, 1904
The United States took ownership of the Panama Canal Zone. At this stage, only the most basic borders were defined; it was a zone surrounding the canal on each side for five miles, but excluded the cities of Colón and Panama City, which remained exclaves of Panama, as well as the water for their harbors.[304] The Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty granting it to the United States was ratified on February 26, 1904.[305] A formal border agreement, which also gave the Canal Zone some land and a lighthouse in northwest Colón, would be ratified on June 15, 1904.[306][307]

May 1, 1915
The borders of the Panama Canal Zone were explicitly defined. Whereas the original definition was a simple corridor surrounding the canal, this treaty specified the actual border. Among the changes this caused were: a slice of Canal Zone was ceded to Panama so Panama City would be connected with the rest of the country; the middle island of the Las Tres Hermanas Islands, which marked the border of Panama City's harbor, was wholly made part of Canal Zone; Gatun Lake and other surrounding waters were formally annexed to the territory; and an area of northwest Colón was ceded to Canal Zone.[326][327][328]

June 30, 1921
The "Wedge" dispute between Delaware and Pennsylvania was resolved in Delaware's favor. The disputed land had generally been administered by Delaware, even electing a member of the Delaware legislature in the mid-19th century,[340] but federal maps had included the land as part of Pennsylvania at least as late as 1900.[341] The states had agreed on a resolution, and it was affirmed by an act of Congress on this date.[342][343] Some sources, contemporary and modern, note that, in the original process of resurveying the border in 1892, a very thin, horn-shaped region along the arc was transferred from Delaware to Pennsylvania;[340][343][344] however, no federal maps found reflect this, and it is unclear if this transfer actually occurred.

Swains Island was added to American Samoa.[349]
Pacific Ocean:



July 17, 1925
The border with Canada was adjusted in several places.[350][351] The only change to a land border redefined how the border between the Lake of the Woods and the Rocky Mountains should be considered; previously, the border followed the curve of the parallel between each border monument, while the treaty changed this to straight lines between each monument. Through this, the United States netted a gain of between 30 and 35 acres of land. Due to the extremely small shift, the lack of specific documentation of where the changes occurred, and the lack of any human impact, this change is not mapped. There was also a change to the border in the Lake of the Woods; due to inaccurate surveying, the previous border intersected itself several times in the lake, creating enclaves of United States water surrounded by Canadian water. The treaty changed the border to use the southernmost intersection as the northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods. Finally, the maritime border in the Bay of Fundy was adjusted, netting Canada roughly 9 acres of water.

November 22, 1926
The Supreme Court of the United States defined the border between Michigan and Wisconsin, transferring all islands south of the Quinnesec Falls on the Menominee River to Wisconsin, and all islands north of the falls to Michigan; it is unknown specifically which islands were transferred in this fashion. However, an error in the border description introduced a small overlap between the two states over several islands in Lake Michigan north of the Door Peninsula.[353]

Bancos along the Rio Grande[edit]
Main articles: United States territorial acquisitions § Mexican boundary, and Banco Convention of 1905
The Banco Convention of 1905 between the United States and Mexico allowed, in the event of sudden changes in the course of the Rio Grande (as by flooding), for the border to be altered to follow the new course.[415] The sudden changes often created bancos, land left behind when curves in the river are cut off by rapid erosion of the channel or are intentionally cut to re-align it. When these bancos are created, the International Boundary and Water Commission investigates if land previously belonging to the United States or Mexico is to be considered on the other side of the border.[416] In all cases of these adjustments under the 1905 convention, which occurred on 37 different dates from 1910 to 1976, the transferred land was minuscule (ranging in size from 1 acre to 646 acres) and uninhabited.[417][418]
