Florida State University (commonly referred to as Florida State or FSU) is an American public space-grant and sea-grant research university. Its primary campus is located on a 1,391.54-acre (5.631 km2) campus in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida. Founded in 1851, it is located on the oldest continuous site of higher education in the state of Florida.[2][4]
The university is classified as a Research University with Very High Research by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.[10] The university comprises 16 separate colleges and more than 110 centers, facilities, labs and institutes that offer more than 360 programs of study, including professional school programs.[11] The university has an annual budget of over $1.7 billion and an annual economic impact of over $10 billion.[12][13] Florida State is home to Florida's only National Laboratory – the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and is the birthplace of the commercially viable anti-cancer drug Taxol. Florida State University also operates The John & Mable Ringling Museum of Art, the State Art Museum of Florida and one of the largest museum/university complexes in the nation.[14]
The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Florida State University is home to nationally ranked programs in many academic areas, including law, business engineering, medicine, social policy, film, music, theater, dance, visual art, political science, psychology, social work, and the sciences.[15] Florida State University leads Florida in four of eight areas of external funding for the STEM disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).[16]
FSU officially launched the "Raise the Torch: The Campaign for Florida State" on October 17, 2014. The campaign has a fundraising goal of more than $1 billion which will improve academics, research, and the overall student experience. As of September 30, 2016, Florida State University's "Raise the Torch" campaign has raised $938,972,249.[17]
For 2017, U.S. News & World Report ranked Florida State as the 33rd best public university in the United States.[18] Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature designated Florida State University as one of two "preeminent" state universities in the spring of 2013 among the twelve universities of the State University System of Florida.[19][20][21]
FSU's intercollegiate sports teams, commonly known by their "Florida State Seminoles" nickname, compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). In their 113-year history, Florida State's varsity sports teams have won 20 national athletic championships and Seminole athletes have won 78 individual NCAA national championships.[22]

History
Main article: History of Florida State University
In 1819 the Florida Territory was ceded to the United States by Spain as an element of the Adams–Onís Treaty.[23] The Territory was conventionally split by the Appalachicola or later the Suwannee rivers into East and West areas. Florida State University is traceable to a plan set by the 1823 U.S. Congress to create a system of higher education.[24] The 1838 Florida Constitution codified the basic system by providing for land allocated for the schools.[25] In 1845 Florida became the 27th State of the United States, which permitted the resources and intent of the 1823 Congress regarding education in Florida to be implemented.
In 1851 the Florida Legislature voted to establish two seminaries of higher education on opposite sides of the Suwannee River.[26] Francis W. Eppes and other city leaders established an all-male academy called the Florida Institute in Tallahassee as a legislative inducement to locate the West Florida Seminary in Tallahassee.[27] The East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala in 1853, closed in 1861, and reopened in Gainesville in 1866.[28] The East Florida Seminary is the institution to which the modern University of Florida traces its foundation.[28][29][30]




West Florida Seminary main building, circa 1880. Built in 1854 as the Florida Institute. This building was replaced with College Hall in 1891. The Westcott Building now stands on this site – the oldest site of higher education in Florida


The West Florida Seminary, also known as the Florida State Seminary,[31] opened for classes in Tallahassee in 1857, absorbing the Florida Institute, which had been established as an inducement for the state to place the seminary in the city.[32] The former Florida Institute property, located where the historic Westcott Building now stands, is the oldest continuously used site of higher education in Florida. The area, slightly west of the state Capitol, was formerly and ominously known as Gallows Hill, a place for public executions in early Tallahassee.[33][34] In 1858 the seminary absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy, established in 1843, and became coeducational.[35]
Civil War and Reconstruction
In 1860–61 the legislature started formal military training at the school with a law amending the original 1851 statute.[36] During the Civil War, the seminary became The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute. Enrollment at the school increased to around 250 students with the school establishing itself as perhaps the largest and most respected educational institution in the state.[36] Cadets from the school defeated Union forces at the Battle of Natural Bridge in 1865, leaving Tallahassee as the only Confederate capital east of the Mississippi River not to fall to Union forces.[37][38] The students were trained by Valentine Mason Johnson, a graduate of Virginia Military Institute, who was a professor of mathematics and the chief administrator of the college.[39] After the fall of the Confederacy, campus buildings were occupied by Union military forces for approximately four months and the West Florida Seminary reverted to its former academic purpose.[40] In recognition of the cadets, and their pivotal role in the battle, the Florida State University Army ROTC cadet corps displays a battle streamer bearing the words "NATURAL BRIDGE 1865" with its flag. The FSU Army ROTC is one of only four collegiate military units in the United States with permission to display such a pennant.[41]
First state university




Chemistry lab in 1900, at what was then known as the West Florida Seminary


In February 1883 the West Florida Seminary became part of Florida University, the first state university in Florida.[42] Under the new university charter, the seminary became the institution's Literary College, and was to contain several "schools" or departments in different disciplines.[42] However, in the new university association the seminary's "separate Charter and special organization" were maintained.[43] Florida University also incorporated the Tallahassee College of Medicine and Surgery, and recognized three more colleges to be established at a later date.[42] The Florida Legislature recognized the university under the title "University of Florida" in Spring 1885, but committed no additional financing or support.[26][44] Without legislative support, the university project struggled. The institution never assumed the "university" title,[44] and the association dissolved when the medical college relocated to Jacksonville later that year.[42] However, the act recognizing the Tallahassee institution as the "University of Florida" was not repealed until 1903, when the title was transferred to what had been the Florida Agricultural College.[44]
However, the West Florida Seminary, as it was still generally called, continued to expand and thrive. It shifted its focus towards modern-style post-secondary education, awarding "Licentiates of Instruction", its first diplomas, in 1884, and awarding Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1891.[26] It had become Florida's first liberal arts college by 1897, and in 1901 it was reorganized into the Florida State College with four departments (the College, the College Academy, the School for Teachers and the School of Music).[26]
Buckman Act




Florida State College for Women, c. 1930


The 1905 the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act, which reorganized the Florida college system into a school for white males (University of the State of Florida), a school for white females (Florida Female College later changed to Florida State College for Women), and a school for African Americans (State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students).[45] The Buckman Act was controversial, as it changed the character of a historic coeducational state school into a school for women. An early and major benefactor of the school, James Westcott III (1839–1887), willed substantial monies to the school to support continued operations. In 1911 his estate sued the state educational board contending the estate was not intended to support a single-sex school. The Florida Supreme Court decided the issue in favor of the State of Florida stating the change in character (existing from 1905 to 1947) was within the intent of the Westcott will.[46] By 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women's college in the United States and was the first state women's college in the South to be awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, as well as the first university in Florida so honored.[47][48] Florida State was the largest of the original two universities in Florida, even during the period as the college for women until 1919.[49]
"Florida State University"
Returning soldiers using the G.I. Bill after World War II stressed the state university system to the point that a Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida (TBUF) was opened on the campus of the Florida State College for Women with the men housed in barracks on nearby Dale Mabry Field.[26] By 1947 the Florida Legislature returned the FSCW to coeducational status and designated it Florida State University.[50] The FSU West Campus land and barracks plus other areas continually used as an airport later became the location of the Tallahassee Community College. The post-war years brought substantial growth and development to the university as many departments and colleges were added including Business, Journalism (discontinued in 1959), Library Science, Nursing and Social Welfare.[51] Strozier Library, Tully Gymnasium and the original parts of the Business building were also built at this time.
Student activism and racial integration




Student protest in Tallahassee – 1970


During the 1960s and 1970s Florida State University became a center for student activism especially in the areas of racial integration, women's rights and opposition to the Vietnam War. The school acquired the nickname "Berkeley of the South"[52] during this period, in reference to similar student activities at the University of California, Berkeley. The school is also purported to have originated the 1970s fad of "streaking", said to have been first observed on Landis Green.[53][54]
After many years as a segregated university, in 1962 Maxwell Courtney became the first African-American undergraduate student admitted to Florida State.[55] In 1968 Calvin Patterson became the first African American player for the Florida State University football team.[56] Florida State today has the highest graduation rate for African American students of all universities in Florida.[57]
On March 4, 1969 the FSU chapter of Students for a Democratic Society, an unregistered university student organization, sought to use university facilities for meetings. The FSU administration, under President Stanley Marshall, subsequently decided not to allow the SDS the use of university property and obtained a court injunction to bar the group. The result was a protest and mass arrest at bayonet point of some 58 students in an incident later called the Night of the Bayonets.[58] The university Faculty Senate later criticized the administration's response as provoking as an artificial crisis.[59] Another notable event occurred when FSU students massed in protest of student deaths at Kent State University causing classes to be canceled.[60] Approximately 1000 students marched to the ROTC building where they were confronted by police armed with shotguns and carbines. Joining the all-night vigil, Governor Claude Kirk appeared unexpectedly with a wicker chair and spent hours, with little escort or fanfare, on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students.[60]




Rally at Westcott, February 13, 2008


LGBTQ activism at FSU is unusual in that it was actually a fight against the school itself. The Pride Student Union (PSU), originally LGBSU, was founded in 1969 to represent LGBTQ students.[61][62] In 1980 a gay male named William Wade won the title of Homecoming Princess under the pseudonym "Billy Dahling" causing controversy.[63][64][65] In 2006 the Union Board added sexual orientation to its nondiscrimination policy causing several student organizations to be zero-funded for noncompliance. Christian Legal Society had the student senate reverse the freezing after threatening a lawsuit[66][67] which resulted in the founding of The Coalition for an Equitable Community (CFEC) to advocate for an inclusive nondiscrimination policy.[68][69] In 2008 CFEC filed suit with the FSU Student Supreme Court against the Union Board for failing to uphold the policy though they ruled they lacked jurisdiction after hearing the case.[70] In November 2009 CFEC placed an editorial in the FSView to provide perspective on the issue.[71] In June 2010 the University Board of Trustees passed a resolution protecting students based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.[72]
In March 2002, FSU students pitched "Tent City" on Landis Green for 114 days to compel the university to join the fledgling Worker's Rights Consortium (WRC).[73] The Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) is an independent watchdog group that monitors labor rights worldwide. At the time, FSU earned 2 million dollars a year from merchandising rights. FSU administration initially refused to meet with the WRC, reportedly for fear of harming its relationship with Nike.[73] At the outset of the protest 12 activists were arrested for setting up their tents outside the "free speech zone." The protest ended in July, when administration met student demands and met with the WRC.[73]
21st century




Florida State University College of Medicine


The Florida State University College of Medicine was created in June 2000.[74] It received provisional accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education on October 17, 2002, and full accreditation on February 3, 2005. The King Life Sciences Building, which sits next to the College of Medicine, was completed in June 2008, bringing all the biological sciences departments under one roof.
Following the creation of performance standards by the Florida Legislature in 2013, Florida Governor Rick Scott and the Florida Board of Governors designated Florida State University and the University of Florida as the two "preeminent universities" among the twelve universities of the State University System of Florida.[75][76] Florida State's new preeminent status calls for an increased state commitment of $75 million divided into $15 million increments from 2013–2018.[77]
Academics

Florida State University aspires to become a top twenty-five public research university with at least one-third of its PhD programs ranked in the top 15 nationally.[78] The university owns more than 1,600 acres (6.4 km²) and is the home of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory among other advanced research facilities. The university continues to develop in its capacity as a leader in Florida graduate research. Other milestones at the university include the first ETA10-G/8 supercomputer,[79] capable of 10.8 GFLOPS in 1989, remarkable for the time in that it exceeded the existing speed record of the Cray-2/8, located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory by a substantial leap and the development of the anti-cancer drug Taxol.

The middle 50% of the Fall 2017 incoming freshmen class had a GPA range from 4.0 – 4.5; a SAT total range from 1240 to 1360 and an ACT range from 27 – 31.[87] FSU's freshman retention rate is 93%.[94] Florida State University has one of the highest retention rates in the United States.[95] The university has a 80.0% six-year graduation rate compared to the national average six-year graduation rate of 59%.[96][97] For 2017, Florida State University has received a record 42,325 freshman applications, therefore making admission to the university a yearly competitive process.[98]
Limited Access Programs
A number of undergraduate academic programs at Florida State University are termed "Limited Access Programs". Limited Access Programs are programs where student demand exceeds available resources. Admission is thus restricted and sometimes extremely competitive. Examples of limited access programs include The Florida State University Film School, the College of Communication and Information, the College of Nursing, Computer Science, most of the majors in the College of Education, several majors in the College of Visual Arts, Theatre and Dance and all majors in the College of Business.[99]
Honors Program




Landis Hall dormitory, the traditional home of honors students since 1955.


Florida State University has a nationally recognized honors program.[100] The University Honors Office supports the university's long tradition of academic excellence by offering two programs, the University Honors Program and the Honors in the Major Program, which highlight the institution's strengths in teaching, research, and community service. The Honors Program also offers special scholarships, internships, research, and study abroad opportunities.
Admission into the University Honors Program is by invitation only. The average academic profile of students that were offered honors invitations in 2015 was as follows: 4.2 weighted GPA; 32 ACT composite; 2080 SAT total. For the Honors in the Major Program students, the University Honors Office requires that prospective students have at least sixty semester hours and at least a 3.2 cumulative FSU GPA.[101] The Honors program offers students housing in Landis Hall and Gilchrist Hall. Landis Hall is the traditional home of Honors students since 1955, which is situated on Landis Green at the heart of FSU's main campus. Gilchrist Hall also houses Honors students and is conveniently located adjacent to Landis Hall. The two halls enjoy a shared study which allows Honors students living in either residence hall to easily gather with classmates and friends.
Scholarships
The Presidential Scholars Program is the premier undergraduate scholarship program at Florida State University. The program provides four years of support and is open to high school seniors who are admitted into Florida State University's Honors Program. The total award package for Presidential Scholars is $31,200, plus an out-of-state tuition waiver. This includes the $9,600 Presidential Scholarship distributed over four years and a $9,600 Admissions Scholarship distributed over four years. It also includes $12,000 for educational enrichment opportunities including international experiences such as Study Abroad and Global Scholars, research and creative projects, service learning projects or public service, internships, and entrepreneurial development. Support and guidance is offered through the Honors Program, Center for Undergraduate Research and Academic Engagement and the Office of National Fellows.[102]
International Programs




Fountain on Landis Green


Florida State University's International Programs (FSU IP) is ranked 12th in the nation among university study abroad programs. Every year Florida State consistently sends over 2,276 students across the world to study in multiple locations.[103] As a student of IP, students are able to take classes that meet their major and/or minor requirements, study with experts in their field, and earn FSU credit.
Florida State has four permanent study centers providing residential and academic facilities in London; Florence, Italy; Valencia, Spain; and Panama City, Panama.[104]
Florida State University is well known for its undergraduate and graduate study abroad options: according to Uni in the USA, "the large numbers of students that study abroad nicely compliment the students that study here from abroad."[105]
Young Scholars Program
The FSU Young Scholars Program is a competitive residential science and mathematics program for 40 Florida high-school students with potential for careers in the sciences, engineering, and health professions.[106][107] Admission to the FSU YSP generally requires completing the eleventh grade and scoring at least 90% on a national standardized examination such as the SAT or PSAT. The PSAT math average is approximately 96% and the PSAT verbal average is approximately 94%. Many students are first in their class at their home schools, with 79% being in the top ten of their class.[108]
Rhodes Scholars
In 1905 Florida State earned Florida's first Rhodes Scholar.[109][110] In 1977 Florida State University earned the first female Rhodes Scholar in Florida.[111] In 2008, Florida State undergraduate and football player Myron Rolle earned the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship award. Rolle is the fifth FSU student overall to earn this award and the third since 2005. Joe O'Shea, an FSU Student Body President, and Garrett Johnson, an FSU student athlete, earned the award in 2007 and 2005, respectively.[112][113] Only thirty-two students in the United States earn the award each year.[114]

This facility is the largest and highest powered laboratory of its kind in the world and produces the highest continuous magnetic fields.
High-Performance Materials Institute




FSU College of Engineering


The High-Performance Materials Institute (HPMI) is a multidisciplinary research institute at Florida State University. Currently, HPMI is involved in four primary technology areas: High-Performance Composite and Nanomaterials, Structural Health Monitoring, Multifunctional Nanomaterials Advanced Manufacturing and Process Modeling.
Over the last several years, HPMI has proven a number of technology concepts that have the potential to narrow the gap between research and practical applications of nanotube-based materials. These technologies include magnetic alignment of nanotubes, fabrication of nanotube membranes or buckypapers, production of nanotube composites, modeling of nanotube-epoxy interaction at the molecular level, and characterization of SWNT nanocomposites for mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, thermal management, radiation shielding and EMI attenuation. HPMI personnel also established Florida's first National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC).
In 2006, the Florida Board of Governors designated HPMI as a Center of Excellence in Advanced Materials and awarded $4 million to further HPMI's efforts in technology transfer, economic development and work force training. Under its cluster hiring program, FSU has awarded the HPMI team with an additional $4 million to recruit and hire some of the nation's top researchers in Materials. HPMI personnel moved into the new $20 million, 45,000 square foot Materials Research Building, which houses the latest state-of-the art equipment and facilities for materials research, especially designed for research in nanomaterials.[171]
The Center for Advanced Power Systems
Florida State University's Center for Advanced Power Systems (CAPS) has become the first university test site accredited by the U.S. Navy to perform high-powered simulations as the center develops next-generation shipboard power technology.
The Center for Advanced Power Systems is a multidisciplinary research center organized to perform basic and applied research to advance the field of power systems technology. CAPS' emphasis is on application to electric utility, defense, and transportation, as well as, developing an education program to train the next generation of power systems engineers. The research focuses on electric power systems modeling and simulation, power electronics and machines, control systems, thermal management, cyber-security for power systems, high temperature superconductor characterization and electrical insulation research. With support from the U.S. Navy, Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the U.S. Department of Energy, CAPS has established a unique test and demonstration facility with one of the largest real-time digital power systems simulators along with 5 MW AC and DC test beds for hardware in the loop simulation. The center is supported by a research team composed of dedicated and highly skilled researchers, scientists, faculty, engineers, and students, recruited from across the globe, with strong representation from both the academic/research community and industry.[172]
In January 2015, Florida State University's Center for Advanced Power Systems has unveiled a new 24,000-volt direct current power test system, the most powerful of its kind available at a university research center throughout the world. The new test facility is the latest piece of the center's PHIL testing program. It has a 24,000-volt direct current with a capacity of 5 megawatts, making it the most powerful PHIL system of its kind at a university research center worldwide. To create the new system, the center put together four individual 6 kilovolt, 1.25 megawatt converters that can be arranged in any combination, in series or parallel connection, to form an extremely flexible test bed for medium voltage direct current (MVDC) system investigations.[173]
CAPS researchers are also collaborating with Virginia Tech on a project for the U.S. Office of Naval Research to evaluate the performance of an electrical impedance measurement unit (IMU) developed by Virginia Tech and to be shipped to CAPS for testing. The purpose of an IMU is to probe a power system for its impedance characteristics to establish criteria for stable operation of the system.
CAPS is a long-term contractor with the U.S. Navy, which is working to develop an all-electric ship. The Navy has also committed funding to study design and performance of fault current limited MVDC systems and other operational aspects of MVDC systems.
Participation in the Large Hadron Collider
After decades of planning and construction the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a next generation detector for the new proton-proton collider (7 TeV + 7 TeV) called the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which is now operational in the existing 17 mi (27 km) circular underground tunnel near Geneva, Switzerland at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. Florida State University faculty members collaborated in the design, construction and operation of the LHC, with some components assembled at Florida State and shipped to CERN for installation.[174] Florida State faculty contributed to several areas of the CMS, especially the electromagnetic calorimeter and the hadron calorimeter.[175]
MIT Contest of lab award
The National Science Foundation awarded Florida State University the right in 1990 to host the new National High Magnetic Field Laboratory rather than improve the existing Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory controlled by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) together with a consortium of other universities.[170] The award of the laboratory was contested by MIT in an unprecedented request to the NSF for a review of the award.[176] The NSF denied the appeal, explaining that the superior enthusiasm for and commitment to the project demonstrated by Florida State led to the decision to relocate the lab.[177]

Student life
Traditions




It is traditional for students to be dunked in the Westcott fountain on special occasions


The university's colors are garnet and gold.[186] The colors of garnet and gold represent a merging of the university's past. While the school fielded a football team as early, or earlier than 1899,[187] in 1902, 1903 and 1905 the team won football championships wearing purple and gold uniforms.[26][188] The following year, the college student body selected crimson as the official school color. The administration in 1905 took crimson and combined it with the recognizable purple of the championship football teams to achieve the color garnet. After World War II the garnet and gold colors were first worn by a renewed football team in a 14–6 loss to Stetson University on October 18, 1947. Florida State University's marching band is the Marching Chiefs.
Alma mater

Florida State currently has 18 residence halls on campus, housing undergraduate, graduate and international students. Residence halls offer suite-style, apartment-style, and community-style accommodations (starting in Fall 2015, Smith will be the only available community-style hall). Students who are active members of the FSU Greek System may live in chapter housing near campus.[200] There is also a vast amount of off-campus housing options throughout Tallahassee for students to choose from.
Renovated historic student housing residence halls located on the eastern half of campus include Broward, Bryan, Cawthon, Gilchrist, Jennie Murphree, Landis and Reynolds. Deviney, Dorman, Magnolia, and Azalea Halls are the newest residence halls, also located on the Easter half of campus.

Florida State's Reservation is a 73-acre (300,000 m2) lakeside recreational area located off campus.[212] This university retreat on Lake Bradford was founded in 1920 as a retreat for students when FSU was the state college for women between 1905 and 1947. The original name for the retreat was Camp Flastacowo.[213]
Florida State University is one of two collegiate schools in the country to have a circus.[214] The FSU Flying High Circus is a three-ring circus that has performances during the Fall semester (for Parents' Weekend) and Spring semester (their annual homeshow). The circus, founded in 1947 by Jack Haskin, in an extracurricular activity under the Division of Student Affairs that any FSU student may join. Student performers in the circus practice daily, much like any other school sport. The performers help rig their equipment and sew their own costumes. Performances occur in April under the Big Top circus tent.[215]
Student government




Seal for the FSU Student Government


The Florida State University Student Government Association is the governing body of students who attend Florida State University, representing the university's nearly 43,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students. The university's student government currently operates on a yearly $12.86 million budget, one of the largest student government budgets in the United States, and the money is allocated by the Finance Committee of the Legislative Branch.[216]
The student government was established in 1935 and consists of executive, judicial, and legislative branches.[217] The student government executive branch is led by the Student Body President and includes the Student Body Vice President, Student Body Treasurer, six agencies, seven bureaus, and executive secretaries within the Executive Office of the President.
The Student Senate is the legislative branch, and is composed of 80 senators who serve one-year terms. The student body elects the first half during each spring semester and the remaining half during the fall semester. The senators elect a Senate President and Senate President Pro Tempore once a year, after the fall election, to lead the Student Senate.[218]
The student government judicial branch has two major components: the Supreme Court of the Student Body (headed by a Chief Justice) and all elections related officials such as the Supervisor of Elections and the Elections Commission. The Supreme Court consists of seven second or third-year students at the FSU College of Law nominated by the Student Body President and confirmed by the Student Senate.[219] Each justice serves a "life-time" term, which extends through the individual justice's graduation and insulates the court from the politics of student government. The Chief Justice may appoint a marshal and clerk. The election commission is also composed of Florida State University College of Law students and it adjudicates all student government election complaints. The commission has five members, one of whom also serves as the commission chairman.
Campus and area transportation
The FSU campus is served by eight bus routes of the Seminole Express Bus Service. The Seminole Express Bus Service provides transportation to, around, and from campus to the surrounding Tallahassee areas for Faculty, Staff, Students and Visitors. All students, faculty and staff can also ride any StarMetro bus throughout the City of Tallahassee for free by swiping a valid FSUCard.[220] FSU also provides other campus services, including Spirit Shuttle (during football games), Nole Cab, S.A.F.E. Connection, and Night Nole nighttime service.[221]
Florida State University is also served by the Tallahassee International Airport, which is located in the Southwest portion of Tallahassee and has daily services to Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte, and Dallas-Fort Worth.[222]
Student media




WFSU Public Broadcast Center


The campus newspaper, the FSView & Florida Flambeau, is 100 years old now and publishes weekly during the summer and semiweekly on Mondays and Thursdays during the school year following the academic calendar. After changing hands three times in 13 years, the FSView was sold to the Tallahassee Democrat in late July 2006, making it part of the Gannett chain.[223] This exchange was allowed because the FSView had been for a long time a for-profit business that was not legally associated with Florida State University. Since most collegiate newspapers are supported by their colleges, this was also among the first times that a major corporation had acquired a college newspaper.
FSU operates two television stations, WFSU and WFSG,[224] and three radio stations, WFSU-FM, WFSQ-FM and WFSW-FM.[225] FSU operates a fourth radio station, WVFS (V89, "The Voice", or "The Voice of Florida State"), as an on-campus instructional radio station staffed by student and community volunteers.[226] WVFS broadcasts primarily independent music as an alternative to regular radio.
The English Department publishes a literary journal, The Southeast Review, founded in 1979 as Sundog.[227]
Career placement




The Dunlap Student Success Center at Florida State University


The Florida State University Career Center is located in the Dunlap Success Center. Its mission is to provide comprehensive career services to students, alumni, employers, faculty/staff and other members of the FSU community. These services involve on and off-campus job interviews, career planning, assistance in applying to graduate and professional schools, internships, fellowships, co-op placements, research, and career portfolio resources.[228] The Career Center offers workshops, information sessions, and career fairs.

Both alumni and friends of the university participate in ProfessioNole, making themselves available for student inquiries.[229] SeminoleLink is The Career Center's registration system linking students and alumni directly with employers. SeminoleLink is part of the NACElink Network, the largest network of career services and recruiting professionals in the world.[230]
Museums




Ringling Museum of Art courtyard


The Ringling, the State Art Museum of Florida, is located in Sarasota, Florida and is Administered by Florida State University[231] It was established in 1927 as the legacy of Mable and John Ringling for the people of Florida. The institution offers twenty-one galleries of European paintings as well as Cypriot antiquities and Asian, American, and contemporary art. The museum's art collection currently consists of more than 10,000 objects that include a wide variety of paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints, photographs, and decorative arts from ancient through contemporary periods and from around the world. The most celebrated items in the museum are 16th-, 17th-, and 18th-century European paintings, including a world-renowned collection of Peter Paul Rubens paintings.[232] The Ringling Museum collections constitute the largest university museum complex in the United States.[233] In 2014 the Ringling was selected as the second most popular attraction in Florida by the readers of USAToday Travel.[234]
In all, more than 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2) have been added to the campus, which includes the art museum, circus museum, and Cà d'Zan, the Ringlings' mansion, which has been restored, along with the historic Asolo Theater.

Florida State University also maintains the FSU Museum of Fine Arts (MoFA) in Tallahassee. The MoFA permanent collection consists of over 4000 items in 18 sub-collections ranging from pre-Columbian pottery to contemporary art. The museum has a significant number of works of art on paper, including prints of artists as well known as Rembrandt and Pablo Picasso.[236]

Notes



^ Florida State University fixes its date of establishment to 1851, the year the Florida legislature voted to establish two seminaries of learning: West Florida Seminary (which became the Florida State University) and East Florida Seminary (which became the University of Florida).[1] West Florida Seminary used this date of establishment prior to 1905, when the Buckman Act reorganized higher education in Florida and the three resulting state institutions all adopted 1905 as their founding date.[2] In 1935 the Florida Board of Control changed the founding dates of the University of Florida[3] and the Florida State College for Women (now Florida State University) to the years their predecessor Seminaries opened as state-sponsored institutions, and Florida State's founding date was changed to 1857. In 2000 the Florida State University declared 1851 to be its official founding date.[4]
