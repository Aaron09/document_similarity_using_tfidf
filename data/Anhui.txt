History[edit]




Sanhe Town,near Hefei


Anhui Province was established in the sixth year of the Reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, before that, there was no coherent concept of "Anhui". The province also has another name of "Wan" because, during the Spring and Autumn Period (722 B.C.-481 B.C.), a small country named "Wan" was here and a mountain called "Wanshan" is in the province.
Before Anhui was established, this land had a long history. 2 million years ago, human beings inhabited this area - proven by some findings in Fanchang County. Archaeologists have identified the cultural domains of Yangshao, Longshan, dated to the Neolithic Age (between 4,000 and 10,000 years ago).
There are many historic sites found in the province from the period of the Xia Dynasty (2100 B.C.) to the Warring Kingdoms Period (475-221 B.C.). After the Qin Dynasty unified China, this area belonged to different prefectures such as the Jiujiang, Zhang ,Tang and Sishui Prefectures. Anhui became parts of Yang, Yu, and Xu prefectures during Han dynasties. In the period of the Three Kingdoms (A.D. 222-280), Anhui was separately dominated by the Wu State and Wei State. During Jin Dynasty, Southern and Northern dynasties and the Sui Dynasty, Anhui was parts of Yang, Xu and Yu prefectures. Later on, the Hui area flourished quickly and the economy and culture of Hui Prefecture created great influence during Song Dynasty.
During the Yuan Dynasty, ruled by the Mongolian emperor, Anhui area was a part of Henan province. During Ming Dynasty, the area was directly managed by the administration of the Capital of Nanjing. Shortly after Qing Dynasty established, this area and Jiangsu province were merged as one province until the sixth year of the Reign of Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty.
Later during the Qing Dynasty, Anhui played as an extreme important role of Self-Strengthening Movement led by Li Hongzhang, who was an important Prime Minister of later Qing Dynasty. At this time, many western weapons, factories and modern government concepts were introduced into China. In the following 50 years, Anhui became one of the most aggressive areas with liberal thought. Within this environment, many ideologists appeared in Anhui. Several of them impacted the future of China including, Hu Shih (Chinese: 胡適, 17 December 1891 – 24 February 1962), who was a Chinese philosopher, essayist and diplomat, and Chen Duxiu, founder of China communist party and the first General Secretary of the CCP.
In 1938, the province was heavily destroyed because Chiang Kai Shek, the president of Republic of China, broke the dam of Yellow River(the second largest river in China), hoping this strategy could slow down the invasion by the Japanese army. Within only ten days of the dam breaking, the water and sands drowned all of north and middle area of this province, 500,000 to 900,000 Chinese lives were lost, along with an unknown number of Japanese soldiers. The flood prevented the Japanese Army from taking Zhengzhou.
With the establishment of People’s Republic of China in 1949, the capital city of Anhui province moved to a small town, Hefei. At the same time, the provincial government spent a lot of energy and money to develop this new capital city which has become China Top 25 city (of totally 660 cities all over China) in 2010s. After 1949, the government also launched many Water Projects to solve the hurt during World War II. In addition, many other areas of China supported Anhui’s development. In the later 1990s, the province has become one of the fastest growing provinces in China. In 2010s, the province became a part of China Yangtze River Delta Economic Area which is the most developed area of China. And the capital city, Hefei, is set as the sub-central city of this Economic Area, only after Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou.
In terms of culture, Northern Anhui was firmly a part of the North China Plain together with modern-day Henan province, northern Jiangsu and southern Shandong provinces. Central Anhui was densely populated and constituted mostly of fertile land from the Huai River watershed. In contrast, the culture of Southern Anhui, bordered mostly along the Yangtze, was closer to Jiangxi and southern Jiangsu provinces. The hills of southeastern Anhui formed a unique and distinct cultural sphere of its own.
Geography[edit]

Anhui is quite diverse topographically. The north of the province is part of the North China Plain while the north-central areas are part of the Huai River watershed. Both of these regions are very flat and densely populated. The land becomes more uneven further south, with the Dabie Mountains occupying much of southwestern Anhui and a series of hills and ranges cutting through southeastern Anhui. The Yangtze River finds its way through south Anhui in between these two mountainous regions. The highest peak in Anhui is Lotus Peak, part of Huangshan in southeastern Anhui. It has an altitude of 1873 m.
Major rivers include the Huai River in the north and the Yangtze in the south. The largest lake is Lake Chaohu situated in the center of the province, with an area of about 800 km2 (310 sq mi). The southeastern part of the province near the Yangtze River has many lakes as well.
As with topography, the province differs in climate from north to south. The north is more temperate and has more clearcut seasons. January temperatures average at around −1 to 2 °C north of the Huai River, and 0 to 3 °C south of the Huai River; in July temperatures average 27 °C or above. Plum rains occur in June and July and may cause flooding.
Anhui has 16 cities. Economically, top 3 cities are, Hefei,Wuhu and Anqing.

Administration[edit]
Main articles: Politics of Anhui and List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China




Provincial Congress meeting


The Politics of Anhui Province is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.
The Governor of Anhui (安徽省省长) is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Anhui. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Anhui Communist Party of China Provincial Committee Secretary (安徽省委书记), colloquially termed the "Anhui Party Chief".
Most provincial government departments and the Governor office are located at No.1 Zhongshan Road,moved from old downtown of Hefei since 2016.Provincial government is responsible to manage 16 prefecture-level cities, 105 counties, 1845 townships and different departments in Anhui. The National People's Congress (NPC) is just located near provincial government.The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (C.P.P.C.C.) is located at No.317,Suzhou Road.The Provincial Higher People's Court is located No.472.Changjiang Rd.
Typically,annual provincial congress meeting is hold in the first quarter of each year shortly before national congress meeting and the annual meeting of C.P.P.C.C is hold in the first quarter or the fourth quarter of each year.
Economy[edit]

Agriculture in Anhui varies according to the climate zones that the province crosses. To the north of the Huai River, wheat and sweet potatoes are grown, while to the south of the Huai River it is rice and wheat instead.
Natural resources of Anhui include iron in Ma'anshan, coal in Huainan, and copper in Tongling. There are industries related to these natural resources (e.g. steel industry at Ma'anshan). One of the famous Anhui-based corporations is the automobile company Chery, which is based in Wuhu.

Compared to its more prosperous neighbours to the east, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, Anhui has lagged markedly behind in economic development, with a GDP per capita around half of those two provinces in 2017 rapidly improved from 1/3 of those two provinces in 2010.(Note:China provincial GDP is based on the population with local Hukou or resident card,a passport-like thing.It means, if a person with Anhui Hukou works in Shanghai, his contribution on economy is counted as Shanghai total GDP. However, when Anhui province calculates its Per-Capital GDP, the person will still be counted as local population although his contribution to this province is 0. At the same time, when Shanghai calculated its Per-capital GDP, the persons without Shanghai Hukou, or Shanghai resident card, will not be recognized as the part of its population. So, the real Per-Capital gap between Anhui and Jiangsu, Zhejiang is much smaller than it appears on statistic data.A province like Anhui has a huge population.Probably, more than 10 million poeple with Anhui Hukou are not working in this province.)
There is great regional disparity as well, and most of the wealth is concentrated in industrial regions close to the Yangtze River, such as Hefei, Wuhu, and Ma'anshan.
Anhui's nominal GDP for 2016 was approximately 2.4 trillion yuan (US$365.8 billion) in the year of 2016. In 2017, the province GPD exceeds Beijing's GDP first time. It is considered as a mid-size economy in terms of economic output.The province has some high tech companies like iFlyTek which was listed as the smartest companies in the world in 2016. At iFlyTek's basis, China Speech Valley was found in 2010s which represents China top concentration of commercialized Artificial Intelligence. The province is China biggest clusters of household electrical appliances as well as many electronic products with the largest volume manufacturing centers of Haier, Hisense, Whirlpool, Gree, Royalstar, Meling. Hefei, as capital city of Anhui, probably is one of China largest intelligence manufacturing centers in the world.
Additionally, the province has developed many other industries/companies within different fields such as :

Healthcare Industries like: Anke Bio,Tonrol Pharm,Zhaoke Pharm
New Enery & New Materials like: JA Solar, SunGrow, Guofeng Plastic, 3M Materials, Unilever
Public Security like: Sun Create, KDlian,China Meyer
Automobile and Construction Machinery like: JAV, Chery, Volkswagen Electronic, Continental AG,Heli Forklift
Construction like: Conch Cement
Semiconductor&electronics like: Hejing Electronic Co(one of world largest Semiconductor product maker)， BOE(world largest LED Screen maker)
Minging & Metal like: Tongling Non-ferrous Metal(One of China largest non-ferrous groups), Maanshan Steel
Robotics like: CSG(manufacturing robots maker),Keyiren
Agriculture and Food like: Fengle Seed,Huida Agro

There are 77 of all 500 Fortune 500 companies have operations in this province such as 3M, ABB, VW, Continental AG, Unilever.
Major Economic and Technological Development Zones[edit]

Transportation[edit]




Anhui High Speed Train






Hefei South Railway Station






One of Metro Entrances in Hefei


Historically, Anhui's transport network was hampered by the lack of bridges across the Yangtze River, which divides the province into northern and southern regions. The first bridge across the Yangtze in Anhui, the Tongling Yangtze River Bridge was completed in 1995. As of October 2014, Anhui had four bridges across the Yangtze, at Ma'anshan, Wuhu, Tongling, and Anqing.
Rail[edit]
Anhui was a place lack of a railway network. The situation has improved in the last 20 years. Most cities in this province are now connected by a high-speed train system. The newest one is Hefeinan Railway Station (Hefei South Railway Station 合肥火车南站) where most high-speed trains pass through. China government has set Hefei as National leading railway hub position in 2016. In addition, Accoring to China central government plan, Anhui will set at least 5 sub-central railway hubs in the next 5 years.
Since Hefei is the hub of China high-speed train system, there are many important railway lines connecting the cities in this province, including:

Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu High-Speed Railway
Hefei-Fuzhou High-Speed Railway
Hefei-Bengbu High-Speed Railway
Shangqiu-Hefei-Hanzhou High-Speed Railway
Hefei-Anqing-Jiujiang High-Speed Railway
Hefei-Qingdao High-Speed Railway (under construction)
Nanjing-Xi'an High-Speed Railway (under construction)
Huainan Raiway
Hefei-Jiujiang Railway
Nanjing-Xi'an Railway
Lujiang-Tongling Raiway (under construction)

Highway system[edit]
Several cities of Anhui have become the "crossroads" of China highway system. The province sets ambitious plan from 2015 to 2025. The important highways include for examples:
G3 Beijing-Taipei Expressway
G40 Shanghai-Xi'an Expressway
G42 Shanghai-Chengdu Expressway
S24 Changshu-Hefei Expressway
And G4212, G5011,National Highway 206,National Highway 312,National Highway 346,S17 Bengbu-Hefei Expressway, G3W Expressway
This is the important reason why so many express companies set their hubs in Hefei.
Subway[edit]
Hefei and Wuhu are the cities already with subway system or subways which have already been under construction. However, there are 9 cities in Anhui with clear plans for subway systems.
Hefei Metro includes 2 lines finished, 3 lines under construction and another 10 lines planned. Wuhu has 2 subway lines(Line 1, Line2) under construction and another 3 lines planned.

Han Chinese make up the vast majority of the population. The Hui and She nationalities are the two largest minorities.
Anhui has a highly unbalanced gender ratio. According to a 2009 study published in the British Medical Journal, in the 1–4 age group, there are 138 boys for every 100 girls, making it among the most unbalanced of provinces in China.[23]

Culture[edit]
Anhui spans many geographical and cultural regions. The northern, flatter parts of the province, along the Huai River and further north, are most akin to neighbouring provinces like Henan, Shandong and northern Jiangsu. In contrast, the southern, hilly parts of the province are more similar in culture and dialect to other southern, hilly provinces, like Zhejiang and Jiangxi.
Mandarin dialects are spoken over the northern and central parts of the province, north of the Yangzi river. Dialects to the north (e.g. Bengbu dialect) are classified as Zhongyuan Mandarin, together with dialects in provinces such as Henan and Shandong; dialects in the central parts (e.g. Hefei dialect) are classified as Jianghuai Mandarin, together with dialects in the central parts of neighbouring Jiangsu province. Non-Mandarin dialects are spoken to the south of the Yangzi: dialects of Wu are spoken in Xuancheng prefecture-level city, though these are rapidly being replaced by Jianghuai Mandarin; dialects of Gan are spoken in a few counties in the southwest bordering Jiangxi province;[24] and the Huizhou dialects are spoken in about ten counties in the far south, a small but highly diverse and unique group of Chinese dialects.
Huangmeixi, which originated in the environs of Anqing in southwestern Anhui, is a form of traditional Chinese opera popular across China. Huiju, a form of traditional opera originating in the Huizhou-speaking areas of southern Anhui, is one of the major precursors of Beijing Opera; in the 1950s, Huiju (which had disappeared) was revived. Luju is a type of traditional opera found across central Anhui, from east to west.
Anhui cuisine is one of the eight great traditions of Chinese cuisine. Combining elements of cooking from northern Anhui, south-central Anhui, and the Huizhou-speaking areas of southern Anhui, Anhui cuisine is known for its use of wild game and herbs, both land and sea, and comparatively simple methods of preparation.
Anhui has a high concentration of traditional products related to calligraphy: Xuanzhou (today Xuancheng) and Huizhou (today Huangshan City) are revered for producing Xuan Paper and Hui Ink, respectively, which are traditionally considered the best types of paper and ink for Chinese calligraphy. She County is famous for the She Inkstone, one of the most preferred types of inkstones (a required tool in traditional calligraphy).[citation needed]

Notes[edit]


^ The data was collected by the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) of 2009 and by the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey (CSLS) of 2007, reported and assembled by Xiuhua Wang (2015)[25] in order to confront the proportion of people identifying with two similar social structures: ① Christian churches, and ② the traditional Chinese religion of the lineage (i. e. people believing and worshipping ancestral deities often organised into lineage "churches" and ancestral shrines). Data for other religions with a significant presence in China (deity cults, Buddhism, Taoism, folk religious sects, Islam, et. al.) was not reported by Wang. The number of Muslims is taken from a survey reported in the year 2010.[26]
^ This may include:

Buddhists;
Confucians;
Deity worshippers;
Taoists;
Members of folk religious sects;
And people not bounded to, nor practicing any, institutional or diffuse religion.
