For the concept in extragalactic astronomy, see Fundamental plane (elliptical galaxies).
The fundamental plane in a spherical coordinate system is a plane of reference that divides the sphere into two hemispheres. The latitude of a point is then the angle between the fundamental plane and the line joining the point to the centre of the sphere.[1]
For a geographic coordinate system of the Earth, the fundamental plane is the Equator. Celestial coordinate systems have varying fundamental planes:[2]

the equatorial coordinate system uses the celestial equator;
the ecliptic coordinate system uses the ecliptic;
the galactic coordinate system uses the Milky Way;
the horizontal coordinate system uses the observer's horizon; and
the Besselian coordinate system uses the Terminator (day/night boundary). This system is a rectangular (x,y,z) system (Cartesian coordinates)
