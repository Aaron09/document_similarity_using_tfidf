GeneCards is a database of human genes that provides genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, genetic and functional information on all known and predicted human genes.[1][2][3][4] It is being developed and maintained by the Crown Human Genome Center at the Weizmann Institute of Science. This database aims at providing a quick overview of the current available biomedical information about the searched gene, including the human genes, the encoded proteins, and the relevant diseases.[1][5][6] The GeneCards database provides access to free Web resources about more than 7000 all known human genes that integrated from >90 data resources, such as HGNC, Ensembl, and NCBI. The core gene list is based on approved gene symbols published by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC).[7][8] The information are carefully gathered and selected from these databases by the powerful and user-friendly engine. If the search does not return any results, this database will give several suggestions to help users accomplish their searching depended on the type of query, and offer direct links to other databases’ search engine.[1] Over time, the GeneCards database has developed a suite of tools (GeneDecks, GeneLoc, GeneALaCart) that has more specialised capability. Since 1998, the GeneCards database has been widely used by bioinformatics, genomics and medical communities for more than 15 years.[7][8]

History[edit]
Since the 1980s, sequence information has become increasingly abundant, many laboratories realized this and started to store these information in the central repositories- the primary database.[9] However, the information provided by the primary sequence databases (lower level database) focus on different aspect. To gather these scattered data, The Weizmann Institute of Science Crown Human Genome Centre developed a database called ‘GeneCards’ in 1997. This database mainly deals with the human genome information, human genes, the encoded proteins’ functions, and the related diseases.[1]
Growth[edit]
Initially, the GeneCards database had two main features: delivery of integrated biomedical information for a gene in ‘card’ format, and a text-based search engine. Since 1998, the database has integrated more data resources and data types, such as protein expression and gene network information. It has also improved the speed and sophistication of the search engine, and expanded from a gene-centric dogma to contain gene-set analyses. Version 3 of the database gathers information from more than 90 database resources based on a consolidated gene list. It has also added a suite of GeneCards tools which focus on more specific purposes. "GeneNote and GeneAnnot for transcriptome analyses, GeneLoc for genomic locations and markers, GeneALaCart for batch queries and GeneDecks for finding functional partners and for gene set distillations.". The database updates on a 3 year cycle of planning, implementation, development, semi-automated quality assurance, and deployment. Technologies used include Eclipse, Apache, Perl, XML, PHP, Propel, Java, R and MySQL.[7][8]

GeneCards Suite[edit]
GeneDecks[edit]
GeneDecks is a novel analysis tool to identify similar or partner genes, which provides a similarity metric by highlighting shared descriptors between genes, based on GeneCards’ unique wealth of combinatorial annotations of human genes.

Annotation combinatory: Using GeneDecks, one can get a set of similar genes for a particular gene with a selected combinatorial annotation. The summary table result in ranking the different level of similarity between the identified genes and the probe gene.
Annotation unification: Different data source often offer annotations with heterogeneous naming system. Annotation unification of GeneDecks is based on the similarity in GeneCards gene-content space detection algorithms.
Partner hunting: In GeneDecks’s Partner Hunter, users give a query gene, and the system seeks similar genes based on combinatorial similarity of weighted attributes.
Set distillation: In Set distiller, users give a set of genes, and the system ranks attributes by their degree of sharing within a given gene set. Like Partner Hunter, it enables sophisticated investigation of a variety of gene sets, of diverse origins, for discovering and elucidating relevant biological patterns, thus enhancing systematic genomics and systems biology scrutiny.[8][10][11]

GeneALaCart[edit]
GeneALaCart is a gene-set-orientated batch-querying engine based on the popular GeneCards database. It allows retrieval of information about multiple genes in a batch query.[7][12]
GeneLoc[edit]
The GeneLoc suit member presents an integrated human chromosome map, which is very important for designing a custom-made capture chip, based on data integrated by the GeneLoc algorithm. GeneLoc includes further links to GeneCards, NCBI's Human Genome Sequencing, UniGene, and mapping resources.[7][13]
Usage[edit]
Search[edit]
Firstly, enter what you want to search into the blank on the homepages. Searching methods include Keywords, Symbol only, Symbol/Alias/Identifier and Symbol/Alias.[5] The default search option is searching by keywords. When you search by keywords, MicroCard and MiniCard are shown. However, when you search by Symbol only, you’ll go directly to GeneCard.[14] Also, you can further your search by clicking on advanced search, where you can choose section, category, GIFtS, Symbol Source and gene sets directly. Sections include Aliases & Descriptions, Disorders, Drugs & Compounds, Expression in Human Tissues, Function, Genomic Location, Genomic Variants, Orthologs, Paralogs, Pathways &Interactions, Protein Domains/Families, Proteins, Publications, Summaries and Transcripts. The default option is searching for all sections.[5] Categories involve Protein-coding, Pseudo genes, RNA genes, Genetic Loci, Gene clusters and Uncategorized. The default option is searching for all categories.[5] GIFtS is the GeneCards Inferred Functionality Scores, which gives objective numbers to show the knowledge level about the functionality of human genes. It includes High, Medium, Low or you can give custom range.[4][15] Symbol Sources include HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee), EntrezGene (gene-centered information at NCBI), Ensembl, GeneCards RNA genes, CroW21 and so on.[5]
Moreover, you can choose to search for all GeneCards or Within gene subset, which would be more specific and with priority.
Secondly, the search result page shows all relevant minicards. Symbol, Description, Category, GIFtS, GC id and Score are displayed on the page.[5] Click on the plus button for each of the mini-cards if you want to open the minicard. Also, you can click directly on the symbol to see the details of a particular GeneCard.

Applications[edit]
GeneCards is used widely in the biological and biomedical fields. For example, S.H. Shah extracted data of early-onset coronary artery disease from GeneCards to identify genes that contributes to the disease. Chromosome 3q13, 1q25 etc. are confirmed to take effects and this paper further discussed the relationship between morbid genes and serum lipoproteins with the help of GeneCard.[16]
Another example is a research study on synthetic lethality in cancer. Synthetic lethality appears when a mutation in a single gene has no effect on the function of a cell but a mutation in an additional gene leads to cell death. This study aimed to find novel methods of treating cancer through blocking the lethality of drugs. GeneCards was used when comparing data of a given target gene with all possible genes. In this process, the annotation sharing score was calculated using GeneDecks Partner Hunter (now called Genes Like Me) to give paralogy. Inactivation targets were be extracted after the microarray experiments of resistant and non-resistant neuroblastoma cell lines.[7]
