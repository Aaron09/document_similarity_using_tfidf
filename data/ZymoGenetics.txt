ZymoGenetics, Inc is one of the oldest biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies in the USA,[1] based in Seattle, Washington. The company is involved in the development of therapeutic proteins. Located on Lake Union, the address of the ZymoGenetics headquarters is 1201 Eastlake Avenue East.[2]
The company was founded in 1981[3] by Professors Earl W. Davie and Benjamin D. Hall of the University of Washington and 1993 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry Michael Smith of the University of British Columbia.[2] Soon after its founding, ZymoGenetics began working on recombinant proteins with Danish company Novo Nordisk, and was acquired by that company in 1988.[4] It was spun off as a public company in 2000.[1] Bristol-Myers Squibb acquired the company in 2010 for $885 million.[5]
ZymoGenetics' headquarters are in the landmark Lake Union Steam Plant building, built from 1914 to 1921 by Seattle City Light, the municipal electric utility.[6]
Corporate governance[edit]
In late 2013, the company's president, Stephen W. Zaruby, left and took up the president and chief executive officer roles at Aurinia Pharmaceuticals.[7]
