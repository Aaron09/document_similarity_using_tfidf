Lahore (/ləˈhɔːr/) (Punjabi: لہور‬; Urdu: لاہور‬‎) is the capital city of the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is the second-most populous city in Pakistan after Karachi.[4] The city is located in the north-eastern end of Pakistan's Punjab province, near the border with the Indian state of Punjab. Lahore is ranked as a beta-world city,[7] and is one of Pakistan's wealthiest cities with an estimated GDP of $58.14 billion (PPP) as of 2014.[8]
Lahore is the historic cultural centre of the Punjab region,[9][10][11] and is the largest Punjabi city in the world.[12] The city has a long history, and was once under the rule of the Hindu Shahis, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, and the Delhi Sultanate. Lahore reached the height of its splendour under the Mughal Empire, serving as its capital city for a number of years. The city was captured by the forces of Persian Afsharid Emperor Nader Shah during his invasion of the Mughal Empire. The city was then contested between different powers before it became capital of the Sikh Empire, and then the capital of the Punjab under British rule.[13] Lahore was central to the independence movements of both India and Pakistan, with the city being the site of both the declaration of Indian Independence, and the resolution calling for the establishment of Pakistan. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Lahore became the capital of Pakistan's Punjab province.
Lahore is one of Pakistan's most liberal[14] and cosmopolitan cities.[15] It exerts a strong cultural influence over Pakistan.[10] Lahore is a major centre for Pakistan's publishing industry, and remains the foremost centre of Pakistan's literary scene. The city is also a major centre of education in Pakistan,[16] with some of Pakistan's leading universities based in the city.[17] Lahore is also home to Pakistan's film industry, Lollywood, and is a major centre of Qawwali music.[18] The city also hosts much of Pakistan's tourist industry,[18][19] with major attractions including the famed Walled City, numerous Sikh shrines, and the Badshahi and Wazir Khan mosques. Lahore is also home to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Lahore Fort and Shalimar Gardens.[19]

Etymology[edit]
A legend based on oral traditions holds that Lahore was known in ancient times as Lavapuri (City of Lava in Sanskrit),[20] and was founded by Prince Lava,[21] the son of Sita and Rama, while Kasur was founded by his twin brother Prince Kusha.[22]
History[edit]
Main articles: History of Lahore and Timeline of Lahore
Early[edit]
Main article: Origins of Lahore
No definitive records exist to elucidate Lahore's earliest history. Archaeological evidence suggests that the modern-day city of Lahore was founded by at least the turn of the first millennium CE,[23] though Lahore's ambiguous early history has allowed it to feature as part of Hindu mythology, which states that Keneksen, the founder of the mythological Suryavansha dynasty, is believed to have migrated out from the city.[24]
Ptolemy mentions in his Geographia a city called Labokla situated near the Chenab and Ravi River which may have been in reference to an ancient Lahore, or an abandoned predecessor of the city.[25] Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang gave a vivid description of a large and prosperous unnamed city when he visited the region in 630 CE that has been identified as Lahore.[26][27]
The first document that mentions Lahore by name is the Hudud al-'Alam ("The Regions of the World"), written in 982 C.E.[28] in which Lahore is mentioned as a town invaded by Arab invaders that had "impressive temples, large markets and huge orchards."[29][30]
Few other references to Lahore remain from before its capture by Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni in the 11th century. Lahore appears to have served as the capital of Punjab during this time under Anandapala of the Kabul Shahi empire, who had moved the capital there from Waihind.[31] The capital would later be moved to Sialkot following Ghaznavid incursions.[27]
Medieval[edit]
Main article: Early Muslim period in Lahore
Ghaznavid[edit]




The Data Darbar shrine, one of Pakistan's most important, was built to commemorate the patron saint of Lahore, Ali Hujwiri, who lived in the city during the Ghaznavid era in the 11th century.


Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni captured Lahore on an uncertain date, but under Ghaznaznavid rule, Lahore emerged effectively as the empire's second capital.[27] In 1021, Sultan Mahmud appointed Malik Ayaz to the Throne of Lahore - a governorship of the Ghaznavid Empire. The city was captured by Nialtigin, the rebellious Governor of Multan, in 1034, although his forces were expelled by Malik Ayaz in 1036.[32]
With the support of Sultan Ibrahim Ghaznavi, Malik Ayaz rebuilt and repopulated the city which had been devastated after the Ghaznavid invasion. Ayaz erected city walls and a masonry fort built in 1037–1040 on the ruins of the previous one,[33] which had been demolished during the Ghaznavid invasion. A confederation of Hindu princes then unsuccessfully laid siege to Lahore in 1043-44 during Ayaz' rule.[27] The city became a cultural and academic centre, renowned for poetry under Malik Ayaz' reign.[34][35]
Lahore was formally made the eastern capital of the Ghaznavid empire in 1152,[23] under the reign of Khusrau Shah.[36] The city then became the sole capital of the Ghaznavid empire in 1163 after the fall of Ghazni.[37] The entire city of Lahore during the medieval Ghaznavid era was probably located west of the modern Shah Alami, and north of the Bhatti Gate.[23]
Mamluk[edit]




The tomb of Lahore's early 13th century governor, Qutbu l-Din Aibak, is located in the city's Anarkali Bazaar.


In 1187, the Ghurids invaded Lahore,[27] ending Ghaznavid rule over Lahore. Lahore was made capital of the Mamluk Dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate following the assassination of Muhammad of Ghor in 1206. Under the reign of Qutbu l-Din Aibak, Lahore attracted poets and scholars from as far away as Turkestan, Greater Khorasan, Persia, and Iraq. Lahore at this time had more poets writing in Persian than any city in Persia or Khorasan.[38][39]
Following the death of Aibak, Lahore came to be disputed among Ghurid officers. The city first came under control of Nasir ad-Din Qabacha, before being briefly captured by Iltutmish in 1217.[27] In an alliance with local Khokhars in 1223, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu of the Khwarazmian dynasty of modern-day Uzbekistan captured Lahore after he fleeing Genghis Khan's invasion of Khwarazm.[27] Jalal ad-Din's then fled from Lahore to capture the city of Uch Sharif after Iltutmish's armies re-captured Lahore in 1228.[27]
The threat of Mongol invasions and political instability in Lahore caused future Sultans to regard Delhi as a safer capital for medieval Islamic India,[40] though it had hitherto been considered a forward base, while Lahore had been widely considered to be the centre of Islamic culture in the subcontinent.[40]
Lahore came under progressively weaker rule under Iltutmish's descendants in Delhi, to the point that governors in the city acted with great autonomy.[27] Under the rule of Kabir Khan Ayaz, Lahore was virtually independent from the Delhi Sultanate.[27] Lahore was sacked and ruined by the Mongol army in 1241.[41] Lahore governor Malik Ikhtyaruddin Qaraqash fled the Mongols,[42] while the Mongols held the city for a few years under the rule of the Mongol chief Toghrul.[40]
In 1266, Sultan Balban reconquered Lahore, but in 1287 under the Mongol ruler Temür Khan,[40] the Mongols again overran northern Punjab. Because of Mongol invasions, Lahore region had become a frontier, with its administrative centre shifted south to Dipalpur.[27] The Mongols again invaded northern Punjab in 1298, though their advance was eventually stopped by Ulugh Khan, brother of Sultan Alauddin Khalji of Delhi.[40] The Mongols again attacked Lahore in 1305.[43]
Tughluq[edit]




Built in 1460, Neevin Mosque is one few remaining pre-Mughal structures in Lahore, and is notable for its unusual foundation below street-level.


The city briefly flourished again under the reign of Ghazi Malik of the Tughluq dynasty between 1320 and 1325, though the city was again sacked in 1329, by Tarmashirin of the Central Asian Chagatai Khanate, and then again by the Mongol chief Hülechü.[27] Khokhars seized Lahore in 1342.[44] The city was retaken by Ghazi Malik's son, Muhammad bin Tughluq.[27] The weakened city then fell into obscurity, and was captured once more by the Khokhars in 1394.[32] By the time Timur captured the city in 1398 from Shayka Khokhar, he did not loot it because it was no longer wealthy.[24]
Late Sultanates[edit]
Timur gave control of the Lahore region to Khizr Khan, Governor of Multan, who later established the Sayyid dynasty in 1414 — the fourth dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate.[45] Lahore was briefly occupied by the Timurid Governor of Kabul in 1432-33.[40] Lahore began to be incurred upon yet again the Khokhar tribe, and so the city was granted to Bahlul Lodi in 1441 by the Sayyid dynasty in Delhi, though Lodi would displace the Sayyids in 1451 by establishing himself upon the throne of Delhi.[27]
Bahlul Lodi installed his cousin, Tatar Khan, to be governor of the city, though Tatar Khan died in battle with Sikandar Lodi in 1485.[46] Governorship of Lahore was transferred by Sikandar Lodi to Umar Khan Sarwani, who quickly left management of this city to his son Said Khan Sarwani. Said Khan was removed from power in 1500 by Sikandar Lodi, and Lahore came under the governorship of Daulat Khan Lodi, son of Tatar Khan and former employer of Guru Nanak - founder of the Sikh faith.[46]

The Begum Shahi Mosque was completed in 1614 in honour of Jahangir's mother, Mariam-uz-Zamani.






Lahore's Wazir Khan Mosque is considered to be the most ornately decorated Mughal-era mosque.[47]


Early Mughal[edit]
Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, captured Lahore in 1524 after being invited to invade by Daulat Khan Lodi, the Lodi governor of Lahore.[27] The city became refuge to Humayun and his cousin Kamran Mirza when Sher Shah Suri rose in power on the Gangetic Plains, displacing Mughal power. Sher Shah Suri continued to rise in power, and seized Lahore in 1540, though Humayun reconquered Lahore in February 1555.[27] The establishment of Mughal rule eventually led to the most prosperous era of Lahore's history.[27] Lahore's prosperity and central position has yielded more Mughal-era monuments in Lahore than Delhi.[48]
By the time of rule of the Mughal empire's greatest emperors, a majority of Lahore's residents did not live within the walled city itself, but instead lived in suburbs that had spread outside of the city's walls.[23] Only 9 of the 36 urban quarters around Lahore, known as guzars, were located within the city's walls during the Akbar period.[23] During this period, Lahore was closely tied to smaller market towns known as qasbahs, such as Kasur, Eminabad, and Batala in modern-day India, which in turn, linked to supply chains in villages surrounding each qasbah.[23]
Akbar[edit]
Beginning in 1584, Lahore became the Mughal capital when Akbar began re-fortifying the city's ruined citadel, laying the foundations for the revival of the Lahore Fort.[23] Akbar made Lahore one of his original twelve subah provinces,[23] and in 1585-86 relegated governorship of the city and subah to Bhagwant Das, brother of Mariam-uz-Zamani, who was commonly known as Jodhabhai.[49]
Akbar also rebuilt the city's walls, and extended their perimeter east of the Shah Alami bazaar to encompass the sparsely populated Rarra Maidan.[23] The Akbari Mandi grain market was set up during this era, and continues to function until present-day.[23] Akbar also established the Dharampura neighbourhood in the early 1580s, which survives today.[50] The earliest of Lahore's many havelis date from the Akbari era.[23] Lahore's Mughal monuments were built under Akbar's reign of several emperors,[23] and Lahore reached its cultural zenith during this period, with dozens of mosques, tombs, shrines, and urban infrastructure developed during this period.
Jahangir[edit]
During the reign of Emperor Jahangir in the early 17th century, Lahore's bazaars were noted to be vibrant. frequented by foreigners, and stocked with a wide array of goods.[23] In 1606, Jehangir's rebel son Khusrau Mirza laid siege to Lahore after obtaining the blessings of the Sikh Guru Arjan Dev.[51] Jehangir quickly defeated his son at Bhairowal, and the roots of Mughal-Sikh animosity grew.[51] Guru Arjan Dev was executed in Lahore in 1606 for his involvement in the rebellion.[52] Emperor Jahangir chose to be buried in Lahore, and his tomb was built in Lahore's Shahdara Bagh suburb in 1637 by his wife Nur Jahan, whose tomb is also nearby.
Shah Jahan[edit]
Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, who reigned between 1628 and 1658, was born in Lahore in 1592. He renovated large portions of the Lahore Fort with luxurious white marble, and erected the iconic Naulakha Pavilion in 1633.[53] Shah Jahan lavished Lahore with some of its most-celebrated and iconic monuments, such as the Shahi Hammam in 1635, and both the Shalimar Gardens and the extravagantly decorated Wazir Khan Mosque in 1641. Lahore's population probably reached its zenith during his reign, with suburban districts home to perhaps 6 times as many compared to within the Walled City.[23]
Aurangzeb[edit]




The iconic Alamgiri Gate of the Lahore Fort was built in 1674, and faces Aurangzeb's Badshahi Mosque.


Shah Jahan's son, and last of the great Mughal Emperors, Aurangzeb, further contributed to the development of Lahore. Aurangzeb built the Alamgiri Bund embankment along the Ravi River in 1662 in order to prevent its shifting course from threatening the city's walls.[23] The area near the embankment grew into a fashionable locality, with several pleasure gardens laid near the bund by Lahore's gentry.[23] The largest of Lahore's Mughal monuments was raised during his reign, the Badshahi Mosque in 1673, as well as the iconic Alamgiri gate of the Lahore Fort in 1674.[54]
Late Mughal[edit]
Civil Wars regarding succession to the Mughal throne following Aurangzeb's death in 1707 lead to weakening control over Lahore from Delhi, and a prolonged period of decline in Lahore.[55] Nader Shah's brief invasion of the Mughal Empire in early 1739 further weakened control over Lahore, leaving it exposed to marauding Sikh clans.[56] Nader Shah's invasion shifted trade routes away from Lahore, and south towards Kandahar instead.[23] Indus ports near the Arabian Sea that served Lahore also silted up during this time, reducing the city's importance even further.[23] Moghul preoccupation with the Marathas in the Deccan eventually resulted in Lahore being governed by a series of governors who pledged nominal allegiance to the ever weaker Mughal emperors of Delhi.[23]
Durrani and Maratha[edit]
During the late 18th century the Mughal Empire was in decline, leading to a power vacuum in the Punjab. Ahmad Shah Durrani, the founder of the Afghan Durrani Empire, took the city for most of the period between 1747 and 1767.[57][26] Durrani rule was briefly interrupted by the Maratha Empire's capture of Lahore in 1758 under Raghunathrao, which drove out Timur Shah Durrani, the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Durrani from Lahore.[58] Following Ahmad Shah Durrani's raids into Punjab that displaced the Marathas, the Marathas defeated the Afghans in the 1759 Battle of Lahore by the combined forces of Marathas and Sikhs under Sabaji Shinde.[59] Following the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761, Ahmad Shah Durrani defeated the Marathas and recaptured Lahore,[60] before eventually retreating to Afghanistan in 1767 in the face of expanding Sikh Misls.[26]

The Tomb of Asif Khan was one of several monuments plundered for its precious building materials during the Sikh period.[55][61]


Early[edit]
The Sikh Misls came into conflict with the Durranis, with Bhangi Misl eventually capturing Lahore by 1767 when Ahmad Shah Durrani returned to Afghanistan.[26] In 1780, The city was divided among three rulers, Gujjar Singh, Lahna Singh, and Sobha Singh, while instability resulting from this arrangement allowed mearby Amritsar to establish itself as the area's primary commercial centre.[23] By the end of the 18th century, the city's population drastically declined, with its remaining resident's living within the city walls, while the extramural suburbs lay abandoned, forcing traveler to travel a few miles through abandoned and ruined suburbs before reaching the city's gates.[23]
Ranjit Singh[edit]




The marble Hazuri Bagh Baradari was built in 1818 to celebrate Ranjit Singh's acquisition of the Koh-i-Noor diamond.[62]


Zaman Shah invaded Punjab in 1799, further destabilising the region and allowing Ranjit Singh of nearby Gujranwala to consolidate his position in the aftermath of the invasion. Singh entered into battle with Zaman, and was able to seize control of the region after a series of battles with the Bhangi Misl and their allies.[63] His army marched to Anarkali, where the gatekeeper of the Lohari Gate, Mukham Din Chaudhry, opened the gates allowing Ranjit Singh's army to enter Lahore.[55] After capturing the Lahore, the Sikh army immediately began plundering the Muslim areas of the city until their actions were reined in by Ranjit Singh.[64]
Ranjit Singh's rule restored much of Lahore's lost grandeur.[23] He established a mint in the city in 1800,[55] and moved into the Mughal palace at the Lahore Fort and re-purposed it for his own use in governing the Sikh Empire.[65] In 1801, he established the Gurdwara Janam Asthan Guru Ram Das to mark the site where Guru Ram Das was born in 1534.
Lahore became the empire's administrative capital, though nearby Amritsar had been established as the empire's commercial and spiritual capital by 1802.[23] By 1812 Singh had mostly refurbished the city's defences by adding a second circuit of outer walls surrounding Akbar's original walls, with the two separated by a moat. Singh also partially restored Shah Jahan's decaying gardens at Shalimar.[citation needed] Ranjit Singh built the Hazuri Bagh Baradari in 1818 to celebrate his capture of the Koh-i-Noor diamond from Shuja Shah Durrani in 1813.[62] He also erected the Gurdwara Dera Sahib to mark the site of Guru Arjan Dev's death in 1606. The Sikh royal court also endowed religious architecture in the city, including a number of Sikh gurdwaras, Hindu temples, and havelis.[66][67]
While much of Lahore's Mughal era fabric lay in ruins by the time of his arrival, Ranjit Singh's rule saw the re-establishment of Lahore's glory - though its Mughal monuments suffered during the Sikh period. Singh's armies plundered most of Lahore's most precious Mughal monuments, and stripped the white marble from several monuments to send to different parts of the Sikh Empire during his reign.[68] Monuments plundered for decorative materials include the Tomb of Asif Khan, the Tomb of Nur Jahan, and the Shalimar Gardens.[69][55] Ranjit Singh's army also desecrated the Badshahi Mosque by converting it into an ammunition depot and a stable for horses.[70] The Sunehri Mosque in the Walled City of Lahore was also converted to a gurdwara,[71] while the Mosque of Mariyam Zamani Begum was repurposed into a gunpowder factory.[72]
Late[edit]
The Sikh royal court, or the Lahore Durbar, underwent a quick succession of rulers after the death of Ranjit Singh, as his son Kharak Singh quickly died, and the next successor Nau Nihal Singh died in an accident at Lahore's Hazuri Bagh on the day of his father's death on 6 November 1840.[55] Maharaja Sher Singh was selected as Maharajah in 1840, though his claim to the throne was quickly challenged by Chand Kaur, widow of Kharak Singh and mother of Nau Nihal Singh, who quickly seized the throne.[55] Sher Singh raised an army that attacked Lahore on 14 January 1841, and mounted weaponry on the minarets of the Badshahi Mosque in order to target Chand Kaur's forces in the Lahore Fort, destroying the fort's historic Diwan-e-Aam.[70] Kaur quickly ceded the throne, but Sher Sing was then assassinated in 1843 in Lahore's Chah Miran neighbourhood along with his Wazir Dhiyan Singh.[62] Dhyan Singh's son, Hira Singh, sought to avenge his fathers death by laying siege to Lahore, resulting in the capture of his father's murderer, Ajit Singh.[55] Duleep Singh was then crowned Maharajah, with Hira Singh as his Wazir, but his power would be weakened by infighting among Sikh nobles.[55]
After the conclusion of two Anglo-Sikh wars, the Sikh empire fell into disarray, resulting in the fall of the Lahore Durbar, and commencement of British rule.[55]

The Shah Alami area of Lahore's Walled City in 1890


The British East India Company seized control of Lahore in February 1846 from the collapsing Sikh state, and occupied the rest of Punjab in 1848.[23] Following the defeat of the Sikhs at the Battle of Gujrat, British troops formally deposed Maharaja Duleep Singh in Lahore that same year.[23] Punjab was then annexed to the British Empire in 1849.[23]
At the commencement of British rule, Lahore was estimated to have a population of 120,000.[73] Prior to annexation by the British, Lahore's environs consisted mostly of the Walled City surrounded by plains interrupted by settlements to the south and east such as Mozang and Qila Gujar Singh, which have since been engulfed by Lahore. The plains between the settlements also contained the remains of Mughal gardens, tombs, and Sikh-era military structures.[74]
The British viewed Lahore's Walled City as a bed of potential social discontent and disease epidemics, and so largely left the inner city alone, while focusing development efforts in Lahore's suburban areas, and Punjab's fertile countryside.[75] The British instead laid out their capital city in an area south of the Walled City that would come to be known as "Civil Station."[76]
Under early British rule, formerly prominent Mughal-era monuments that were scattered throughout Civil Station were also re-purposed, and sometimes desecrated – including the Tomb of Anarkali, which the British had initially converted to clerical offices before re-purposing it as an Anglican church in 1851.[77] The Dai Anga Mosque was converted into railway administration offices during this time as well, while the tomb of Nawab Bahadur Khan was converted into a storehouse, and tomb of Mir Mannu was converted into a wine shop.[78] The British also used older structures to house municipal offices, such as the Civil Secretariat, Public Works Department, and Accountant General's Office.[79]
The British built the Lahore Railway Station just outside the Walled City shortly after the Mutiny of 1857, and so built the station in the style of a medieval castle to ward off any potential future uprisings, with thick walls, turrets, and holes to direct gun and cannon fire for defence of the structure.[80] Lahore's most prominent government institutions and commercial enterprises came to be concentrated in Civil Station in a half-mile wide area flanking The Mall, where unlike in Lahore's military zone, the British and locals were allowed to mix.[81] The Mall continues to serve as the epicentre of Lahore's civil administration, as well as one of its most fashionable commercial areas.
The British also laid the spacious Lahore Cantonment to the southeast of the Walled City at the former village of Mian Mir, where unlike around The Mall, laws existed against the mixing of different races.[82] British authorities built several important structures around the time of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887 in the distinct Indo-Saracenic style. The Lahore Museum and Mayo School of Industrial Arts were both established around this in this style.[83]
The British carried out a census of Lahore in 1901, and counted 20,691 houses in the Walled City.[84] An estimated 200,000 people lived in Lahore at this time.[73] Lahore's posh Model Town was established as a "garden town" suburb in 1921, while Krishan Nagar locality was laid in the 1930s near The Mall and Walled City.
Lahore played an important role in the independence movements of both India and Pakistan. The Declaration of the Independence of India was moved by Jawaharlal Nehru and passed unanimously at midnight on 31 December 1929.[85] The Indian Swaraj flag was adopted this time as well. Lahore's jail was used by the British to imprison independence activists such as Jatin Das, and was also where Bhagat Singh was hanged.[86] Under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah The All India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution in 1940, demanding the creation of Pakistan as a separate homeland for the Muslims of India.[87]
Partition[edit]
The 1941 census showed that Lahore had a population of 671,659, of which was 64.5% Muslim, with the remainder being mostly Sikh and Hindu.[88][89] The population figure was disputed by Hindus and Sikhs before the Boundary Commission that would draw the Radcliffe Line to demarcate the border of the two new states based on religious demography.[88] In a bid to have Lahore awarded to India, they argued that the city was only 54% Muslim, and that Hindu and Sikh domination of the city's economy and educational institutions should trump Muslim demography.[88] Two thirds of shops, and 80% of Lahore's factories belonged to the Hindu and Sikh community,[88] though the British ultimately were unconvinced that ownership of property equated with sovereignty.[88]
As tensions grew over the city's uncertain fate, Lahore experienced Partition's worst riots.[88] Carnage ensued in which all three religious groups were both victims and perpetrators.[90] Early riots in March and April 1947 destroyed 6,000 of Lahore 82,000 homes.[88] Violence continued to rise throughout the summer, despite the presence of armoured British personnel.[88] Hindus and Sikhs began to leave the city en masse as their hopes that the Boundary Commission to award the city to India came to be regarded as increasingly unlikely. By late August 1947, 66% of Hindus and Sikhs had left the city.[88] The Shah Alami Bazaar, once a largely Hindu quarter of the Walled City, was entirely burnt down.[91]
When Pakistan's independence was declared on August 14, 1947, the Radcliffe Line had not yet been announced, and so cries of Long live Pakistan and God is greatest were heard intermittently with Long live Hindustan throughout the night.[88] Upon independence, Lahore was made capital of the Punjab province in the new state of Pakistan. The city's location near the Indian border meant that it received large numbers of refugees fleeing anti-Muslim pogroms in eastern Punjab and northern India, though it was able to accommodate them given the large stock of abandoned Hindu and Sikh properties that could be re-distributed to newly arrived refugees.[88]

Partition left Lahore with a much weakened economy, and a stymied social and cultural scene that had previously been invigorated by the city's Hindus and Sikhs.[88] Industrial production dropped to one third of pre-Partition levels by end of the 1940s, and only 27% of its manufacturing units were operating by 1950, and usually well-below capacity.[88] Capital flight further weakened the city's economy while Karachi industrialized and became more prosperous.[88] The city's weakened economy, and proximity to the Indian border, meant that the city was deemed unsuitable to be the Pakistani capital after independence. Karachi was chosen instead on account of its relative tranquility, stronger economy, and better infrastructure.[88]
After the Partition period, Lahore slowly regained its significance as an economic and cultural centre of western Punjab. Reconstruction began in 1949 of the Shah Alami Bazaar, the former commercial heart of the Walled City until it was destroyed in the 1947 riots.[91] The Tomb of Allama Iqbal was built in 1951 to honour the philosopher-poet who provided spiritual inspiration for the Pakistan movement.[88] In 1955, Lahore was selected to be capital of all West Pakistan during the single-unit period that lasted until 1970.[88] Lahore successfully repelled an Indian invasion during War of 1965, in which the city had been surrounding on three sides. Shortly afterwards, Lahore's iconic Minar-e-Pakistan was completed in 1968 to mark the spot where the Pakistan Resolution was passed.[88] With United Nations assistance, the government was able to rebuild Lahore, and most scars of the communal violence of war and Partition were ameliorated.
The second Islamic Summit Conference was held in the city in 1974.[92] In retaliation for the destruction of the Babri Masjid in India by Hindu fanatics, riots erupted in 1992 in which several non-Muslim monuments were targeted, including most of the tomb of Maharaja Sher Singh.[62] In 1996, the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup final match was held at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.[93]
The Walled City of Lahore known locally as the "Un-droone Shehr" (Inner City) is the oldest and most historic part of Lahore. The Punjab government embarked on a major project in 2009 to restore the Royal Trail (Shahi Guzar Gah) from Akbari Gate to the Lahore Fort with the help of the World Bank under the Sustainable Development of the Walled City of Lahore (SDWCL) project. The project aims at the Walled City development, at exploring and highlighting economic potential of the Walled City as a cultural heritage, exploring and highlighting the benefits of the SWDCL project for the residents, and at soliciting suggestions regarding maintenance of development and conservation of the Walled City.[94]

Religion[edit]
Main article: Religion in Lahore
The city has a Muslim majority and Christian minority population.[107] There is also a small but longstanding Zoroastrian community. Additionally, Lahore contains some of Sikhism's holiest sites, and is a major Sikh pilgrimage site.[108][109]
According to the 1998 census, 94% of Lahore's population is Muslim, up from 60% in 1941. Other religions include Christians (5.80% of the total population, though they form around 9.0% of the rural population) and small numbers of Bahá'ís, Hindus, Ahmediya, Parsis and Sikhs. Lahore's first church was built during the reign of Emperor Akbar in the late 16th century, which was then leveled by Shah Jahan in 1632.[110]
Cityscape[edit]
Urban form[edit]




The area around the Wazir Khan Mosque exemplifies the Walled City's urban form


Lahore's modern cityscape consists of the historic Walled City of Lahore in the northern part of the city, which contains several world and national heritage sites. Lahore's urban planning was not based on geometric design, but was instead built piecemeal, with small cul-de-sacs, katrahs and galis developed in the context of neighbouring buildings.[23] Though certain neighbourhoods were named for particular religious or ethnic communities, the neighbourhoods themselves typically were diverse, and were not dominated by the namesake group.[23]
Lahore has more Mughal-era monuments than Delhi, India,[48] and structures from this era are now amongst the most iconic features of Lahore.
By the end time of Sikh rule, most of Lahore's massive haveli compounds had been occupied by settlers. New neighbourhoods occasionally grew up entirely within the confines of an old Mughal haveli, such as the Mohallah Pathran Wali, which grew within the ruins of a haveli of the same name that was built by Mian Khan.[23] By 1831, all Mughal havelis in the Walled City had been encroached upon by the surrounding neighbourhood,[23] leading to the modern-day absence of any Mughal havelis in Lahore.
Thirteen gates surrounded the history walled city. Some of the remaining gates include the Raushnai Gate, Masti Gate, Yakki Gate, Kashmiri Gate, Khizri Gate, Shah Burj Gate, Akbari Gate and Lahori Gate. Southeast of the walled city is the spacious British-era Lahore Cantonment.
Architecture[edit]
Further information: Architecture of Lahore




Built in 2012, Grand Jamia Mosque in Southern Lahore is a blend of Mughal and modern architecture.


Lahore is home to numerous monuments from the Mughal Dynasty, Sikh Empire, and British Raj. The architectural style of the Walled City of Lahore has traditionally been influenced by Mughal and Sikh styles.[111] The leafy suburbs to the south of the Old City, as well as the Cantonment southwest of the Old City, were largely developed under British colonial rule, and feature colonial-era buildings built alongside leafy avenues.
Sikh period[edit]
By the arrival of the Sikh Empire, Lahore had decayed from its former glory as the Mughal capital. Rebuilding efforts under Ranjit Singh and his successors were influenced by Mughal practices, and Lahore was known as the 'City of Gardens' during the Ranjit Singh period.[112][113] Later British maps of the area surrounding Lahore dating from the mid-19th century show many walled private gardens which were confiscated from the Muslim noble families bearing the names of prominent Sikh nobles – a pattern of patronage which was inherited from the Mughals.
While much of Lahore's Mughal era fabric lay in ruins by the time of his arrival, Ranjit Singh's army's plundered most of Lahore's most precious Mughal monuments, and stripped the white marble from several monuments to send to different parts of the Sikh Empire.[68] Monuments plundered of their marble include the Tomb of Asif Khan, Tomb of Nur Jahan, the Shalimar Gardens were plundered of much of its marble and costly agate.[69][55] The Sikh state also demolished a number of shrines and monuments laying outside the city's walls.[114]
Sikh rule left Lahore with several monuments, and a heavily altered Lahore Fort. Ranjit Singh's rule had restored Lahore to much of its last grandeur,[23] and the city was left with a large number of religious monuments from this period. Several havelis were built during this era, though only a few still remain.[23]
British period[edit]




A syncretic architectural style that blends Islamic, Hindu, and Western motifs took root during the colonial era, as shown at Aitchison College.






Much of old Lahore features colonial-era buildings, such as the Tollinton Market.


As capital of British Punjab, British colonialists made a lasting architectural impression on the city. Structures were built predominantly in the Indo-Gothic style - a syncretic architectural style that blends elements of Victorian and Islamic architecture, or in the distinct Indo-Saracenic style. The British also built neoclassical Montgomery Hall, which today serves as the Quaid-e-Azam Library.[115]
Lawrence Gardens were also laid near Civil Station, and were paid for by donations solicited from both Lahore's European community, as well as from wealth locals. The gardens featured over 600 species of plants, and were tended to by a horticulturist sent from London's Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew.[116]
The British authorities built several important structures around the time of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887 in the distinct Indo-Saracenic style. The Lahore Museum and Mayo School of Industrial Arts were both established around this in this style.[83] Other prominent examples of the Indo-Saracenic style in Lahore include Lahore's prestigious Aitchison College, the Punjab Chief Court (today the Lahore High Court), Lahore Museum and University of the Punjab. Many of Lahore's most important buildings were designed by Sir Ganga Ram, who is sometimes called the "Father of modern Lahore."[117]
Parks and gardens[edit]
Main article: List of parks and gardens in Lahore




Lahore's Lawrence Garden was laid in 1862.


The Shalimar Gardens were laid out during the reign of Shah Jahan and were designed to mimic the Islamic paradise of the afterlife described in the Qur'an. The gardens follow the familiar charbagh layout of four squares, with three descending terraces.
The Lawrence Garden was established in 1862 and was originally named after Sir John Lawrence, late 19th-century British Viceroy to India. The Circular Garden, which surrounds on the Walled City on three sides, was established by 1892.[55]
The many other gardens and parks in the city include Hazuri Bagh, Iqbal Park, Mochi Bagh, Gulshan Iqbal Park, Model Town Park, Race Course Park, Nasir Bagh Lahore, Jallo Park, Wild Life Park, and Changa Manga, a man-made forest near Lahore in the Kasur district. Another example is the Bagh-e-Jinnah, a 141-acre (57 ha) botanical garden that houses entertainment and sports facilities as well as a library.[118][not in citation given]

As of 2008[update], the city's gross domestic product (GDP) by purchasing power parity (PPP) was estimated at $40 billion with a projected average growth rate of 5.6 percent. This is at par with Pakistan's economic hub, Karachi, with Lahore (having half the population) fostering an economy that is 51% of the size of Karachi's ($78 billion in 2008).[119] The contribution of Lahore to the national economy is estimated to be 11.5% and 19% to the provincial economy of Punjab.[120] As a whole Punjab has $115 billion economy making it first and to date only Pakistani Subdivision of economy more than $100 billion at the rank 144.[119] Lahore's GDP is projected to be 102 billion$ by the year 2025, with a slightly higher growth rate of 5.6% per annum, as compared to Karachi's 5.5%.[119][121]
A major industrial agglomeration with about 9,000 industrial units, Lahore has shifted in recent decades from manufacturing to service industries.[122] Some 42% of its work force is employed in finance, banking, real estate, community, cultural, and social services.[122] The city is Pakistan's largest software & hardware producing centre,[122] and hosts a growing computer-assembly industry.[122] The city has always been a centre for publications where 80% of Pakistan's books are published, and it remains the foremost centre of literary, educational and cultural activity in Pakistan.[16]
The Lahore Expo Centre is one of the biggest projects in the history of the city and was inaugurated on 22 May 2010.[123] Defense Raya Golf Resort, also under construction, will be Pakistan's and Asia's largest golf course. The project is the result of a partnership between DHA Lahore and BRDB Malaysia. The rapid development of large projects such as these in the city is expected to boost the economy of the country.[124] Ferozepur Road of the Central business districts of Lahore contains high-rises and skyscrapers including Kayre International Hotel and Arfa Software Technology Park.

Basant is a Punjabi festival marking the coming of spring. Basant celebrations in Pakistan are centred in Lahore, and people from all over the country and from abroad come to the city for the annual festivities. Kite-flying competitions traditionally take place on city rooftops during Basant. Courts have banned the kite-flying because of casualties and power installation losses. The ban was lifted for two days in 2007, then immediately reimposed when 11 people were killed by celebratory gunfire, sharp kite-strings, electrocution, and falls related to the competition.[132]
Tourism[edit]
Lahore remains a major tourist destination in Pakistan. The Walled City of Lahore was renovated in 2014 and is popular due to the presence of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[133] Among the most popular sights are the Lahore Fort, adjacent to the Walled City, and home to the Sheesh Mahal, the Alamgiri Gate, the Naulakha pavilion, and the Moti Masjid. The fort along with the adjoining Shalimar Gardens has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981.[134]

The inner city, on the other hand, remained problematic.Seen as a potential hotbed of disease and social instability, and notoriously difficult to observe and fathom, the inner districts of the city remained stubbornly resistant to colonial intervention. Throughout the British period of occupation in Punjab, for reasons we will explore more fully, the inner districts of its largest cities were almost entirely left alone. 5 The colonial state made its most significant investments in suburban tracts outside of cities...
