Approximate orbit of the Sun (yellow circle) around the Galactic Centre


The galactic year, also known as a cosmic year, is the duration of time required for the Sun to orbit once around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.[1] Estimates of the length of one orbit range from 225 to 250 million terrestrial years.[2] The Solar System is traveling at an average speed of 828,000 km/h (230 km/s) or 514,000 mph (143 mi/s) within its trajectory around the galactic center,[3] a speed at which an object could circumnavigate the Earth's equator in 2 minutes and 54 seconds; that speed corresponds to approximately one 1300th of the speed of light.
The galactic year provides a conveniently usable unit for depicting cosmic and geological time periods together. By contrast, a "billion-year" scale does not allow for useful discrimination between geologic events, and a "million-year" scale requires some rather large numbers.[4]

1 galactic year from now
All the continents on Earth may fuse into a supercontinent. Three potential arrangements of this configuration have been dubbed Amasia, Novopangaea, and Pangaea Ultima[5]


2–3 galactic years from now
Tidal acceleration moves the Moon far enough from Earth that total solar eclipses are no longer possible


4 galactic years from now
Carbon dioxide levels fall to the point at which C4 photosynthesis is no longer possible. Multicellular life dies out[6]


12 galactic years from now
The Earth's magnetic field shuts down [7] and charged particles emanating from the Sun gradually deplete the atmosphere [8]


15 galactic years from now
Surface conditions on Earth are comparable to those on Venus today


22 galactic years from now
The Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy begin to collide


25 galactic years from now
Sun ejects a planetary nebula, leaving behind a white dwarf


30 galactic years from now
The Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant elliptical galaxy called Milkomeda or Milkdromeda [9]


500 galactic years from now
The Universe's expansion causes all galaxies beyond the Milky Way's Local Group to disappear beyond the cosmic light horizon, removing them from the observable universe [10]


2000 galactic years from now
Median Point of the Local Group of 47 galaxies[11] will coalesce into a single large galaxy [12]
