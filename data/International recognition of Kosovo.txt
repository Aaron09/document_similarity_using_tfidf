Since its declaration of independence from Serbia (enacted on 17 February 2008),[1][2] international recognition of Kosovo has been mixed, and the international community continues to be divided on the issue.
As of 27 November 2017, the Republic of Kosovo has received 116 diplomatic recognitions as an independent state, of which two have been withdrawn. Notably, 112 out of 193 (7001580000000000000♠58%) United Nations (UN) member states, 23 out of 28 (7001820000000000000♠82%) European Union (EU) member states, 25 out of 29 (7001860000000000000♠86%) NATO member states, and 36 out of 57 (7001630000000000000♠63%) Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states have recognised Kosovo. The Government of Serbia does not recognise it as a sovereign state, but has begun to normalise relations with the Government of Kosovo in accordance with the Brussels Agreement.

Background[edit]
Further information: Foreign relations of Kosovo
A number of states expressed concern over the unilateral character of Kosovo's declaration, or explicitly announced that they would not recognise an independent Kosovo. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) remains divided on this issue: of its five members with veto power, three (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) have recognised the declaration of independence, while the People's Republic of China has expressed concern, urging the continuation of the previous negotiation framework. The Russian Federation has rejected the declaration and considers it illegal.[3] On 15 May 2008, Russia, China, and India released a joint statement calling for new negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina.[4]
Although EU member states individually decide whether to recognise Kosovo, by consensus the EU has commissioned the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) to ensure peace and continued external oversight. Due to the dispute in the UNSC, the reconfiguration of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and partial handover to the EULEX mission met with difficulties. In spite of Russian and Serbian protests, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon proceeded with the reconfiguration plan. On 15 July 2008, he stated: "In the light of the fact that the Security Council is unable to provide guidance, I have instructed my Special Representative to move forward with the reconfiguration of UNMIK ... in order to adapt UNMIK to a changed reality." According to the Secretary-General, the "United Nations has maintained a position of strict neutrality on the question of Kosovo's status".[5] On 26 November 2008, the UNSC gave the green light to the deployment of the EULEX mission in Kosovo. The EU mission is to assume police, justice, and customs duties from the UN, while operating under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 (UNSCR 1244) that first placed Kosovo under UN administration in 1999.[6]
As of late July 2008, UNMIK no longer provides the citizens of Kosovo with travel documents, while their ability to travel using the new Kosovan passport does not coincide with diplomatic recognition: for example Greece, Romania, and Slovakia accept Kosovo-issued documents for identity purposes, despite not officially recognising its independence. The three neighbouring states that recognise Kosovo—Albania, Montenegro, and Macedonia—all accept the Kosovan passport, which Serbia refuses.[7]

Year


A United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolution adopted on 8 October 2008 backed the request of Serbia to seek an International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence.[8] On 22 July 2010, the ICJ ruled that the declaration of independence of Kosovo "did not violate any applicable rule of international law", because its authors, who were "representatives of the people of Kosovo", were not bound by the Constitutional Framework (promulgated by UNMIK) or by UNSCR 1244 that is addressed only to United Nations Member States and organs of the United Nations.[9][10]
Serbia's reaction[edit]
Main articles: Serbia's reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence, Kosovo–Serbia relations, and Belgrade–Pristina negotiations
See also: 2008 Serbia protests
Due to Serbian claims that Kosovo is part of its sovereign territory, its initial reactions included recalling ambassadors from countries that recognised Kosovo for several months, indicting Kosovar leaders on charges of high treason, and litigating the case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Serbia also expelled ambassadors from countries that recognised Kosovo after the UNGA vote adopting Serbia's initiative to seek an ICJ advisory opinion.[11]
In December 2012, as a result of European Union mediated negotiations on Kosovo's status, Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dačić agreed to appoint a liaison officer to Kosovo.[12] In March 2013, Dačić said that while his government would never recognise Kosovo's independence, "lies were told that Kosovo is ours" and that Serbia needed to define its "real borders".[clarification needed][13]
In April 2013, Kosovo and Serbia reached an agreement to normalise relations, and thereby allow both nations to eventually join the European Union. Under the terms of the agreement, "Belgrade acknowledged that the government in Pristina exercises administrative authority over the territory of Kosovo – and that it is prepared to deal with Pristina as a legitimate governing authority."[14]
On 17 June 2013 Kosovo and Serbia exchanged liaison officers.[15]

Entities that do not recognise Kosovo as an independent state[edit]
Diplomatic recognition is an explicit, official, unilateral act in the foreign policy of states in regards to another party. Not having issued such a statement does not necessarily mean the state has objections to the existence, independence, sovereignty or government of the other party. Some states, by custom or policy, do not extend formal recognitions, on the grounds that a vote for membership in the UN or another organisation whose membership is limited to states is itself an act of recognition.

In March 2008, Mourad Medelci, Algerian Foreign Minister, stated that while Algeria sympathised with all Muslim countries, it believed that international laws had to be adhered to.[176] A year later, Medelci reaffirmed the Algerian position of Kosovo being an integral part of Serbia.[177]
In May 2009, the Ambassador of Algeria to Serbia, Abdelkader Mesdoua stated that Algeria would reconsider the issue of Kosovo if Serbia changed its own position.[178]


 Angola
On 23 June 2008, Angolan president José Eduardo dos Santos sent a message to his Serbian counterpart, Boris Tadić, regarding Kosovo's declaration of independence. It reiterated the solidarity of dos Santos and Angola to Serbia in regard to the preservation of its sovereignty and integrity.[179]


 Argentina
In February 2008, Argentine Foreign Minister, Jorge Taiana said "if we were to recognize Kosovo, which has declared its independence unilaterally, without an agreement with Serbia, we would set a dangerous precedent that would seriously threaten our chances of a political settlement in the case of the Falkland Islands". He said that president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner would not give any official statement on the issue, reiterating that there would be no recognition of Kosovo.[180] Argentina will not recognise also because it "supports the principle of territorial integrity". Additionally, he stressed that the 1999 UNSCR 1244 called for the mutual agreement of all parties to solve the dispute.[181]
In a 2 December 2009 hearing at the ICJ, the Argentine delegation said that Kosovo's declaration of independence "breaches an obligation to respect the territorial integrity of Serbia, the obligation of peaceful settlement of disputes and principle of non-intervention. The resolution has no legal basis in the principle of self-determination," and that it "did not, and could not, abolish Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo".[182][183]


 Armenia
On 12 March 2008, Armenian president Serzh Sargsyan stated that Armenia's possible recognition of Kosovo's independence would not strain Armenia–Russia relations, but also noted that "Kosovo recognition issue needs serious discussion ... Armenia has always been an adherent to the right of nations to self-determination and in this aspect we welcome Kosovo's independence."[184] On 3 September 2008 Sargsyan stated: "Today one is wondering from time to time why Armenia is not recognizing the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The answer is simple: for the same reason that it did not recognize Kosovo's independence. Having the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Armenia can not recognize another entity in the same situation as long as it has not recognized the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic". A nation's right to self-determination "takes times", requiring the understanding of "all interested parties". Accordingly, Armenia is trying to "convince" Azerbaijan to accept the loss of Karabakh, stated the president.[184][185] In November 2008, whilst commenting on Russia's recognition of Georgia's breakaway regions, Sargsyan said "In case with Kosovo the right of nations to self-determination was applied. However, Russia's similar step was given a hostile reception".[186]
At a meeting in May 2009 with Kosovo's Foreign Minister, Skënder Hyseni, the representative of Armenia to the UN, Armen Martirosyan reportedly promised that the request for recognition would be forwarded to his government.[187] On a July 2009 state visit to Armenia, Serbian president Boris Tadić discussed the issues of Kosovo and Nagorno-Karabakh with Sargsyan. The two leaders agreed that regional conflicts must be resolved without the use of force and only by peaceful means in keeping with international law.[188] Tadić also met with Armenian prime minister Tigran Sargsyan where the same issues were discussed. The Kosovo and Nagorno-Karabakh issues can only be solved through negotiations and "any imposed solutions are absolutely unacceptable and we fully agree on that," Tadić said afterwards.[189]
On 4 April 2011 Sargsyan said that Armenia would not recognise the independence of Kosovo against Serbia's interests.[190]


 Azerbaijan
In February 2008, a spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of Azerbaijan, Khazar Ibrahim, said "We view this illegal act as being in contradiction with international law. Proceeding from this, Azerbaijan's position is clear: it does not recognise [Kosovo's] independence".[191] Azerbaijan has also withdrawn peacekeepers from Kosovo. Zahid Oruj, a member of the parliamentary committee on defence and security, explained it by saying "Owing to the change of situation in Kosovo, the Azeri peacekeeping battalion performing its mission within the Turkish contingent will be withdrawn. Azerbaijan acts in compliance with the country's political stance".[192] At the summit of the OIC on 10 March 2008, Azerbaijan opposed adoption of the document, proposed by Turkey, that would lend support to Kosovo's declaration of independence.[193] On 19 June 2008, during the meeting of OIC, Azerbaijan was among countries that opposed the recognition of Kosovo as an independent country.[194]
In a 3 December 2009 hearing at the ICJ, the Azerbaijani delegation said that entities that declare secession while violating the internal laws of the state can not be considered to be states, and that a fait accompli may not be accepted – power is not the right, and the force is not the law.[195]
At a meeting with Serbian president Boris Tadić in Baku in May 2010, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev said that Serbia and Azerbaijan mutually help each other in the international arena and that his country provides strong support for the territorial integrity of Serbia. He stated that the unilaterally proclaimed independence of Kosovo is an illegal move and called on all UN member states to respect international law.[196]

On 26 September 2012, the Bahamian Foreign Minister, Frederick A. Mitchell, said that his state has sympathy for the independence of Kosovo, and that the Bahamas will support the state of Kosovo.[199]


 Barbados
At a meeting in January 2009 with Kosovo's Foreign Minister, Skënder Hyseni, Barbados' general consul assigned to Vienna, Kurt Mach, promised to inform his government about Kosovo's achievements, and that he would encourage his country to consider recognising Kosovo.[200]


 Belarus
In February 2008, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko wrote in a letter to Serbian President Boris Tadić that "Belarus expresses its solidarity with the Serbians' intention to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity".[201] The National Assembly of Belarus had issued a statement condemning the declaration of independence and encouraged all nations to call the move "illegal" under international law.[202][203]
The Foreign Ministry of Belarus published a statement saying "that the settlement of the Kosovo and Metochia [sic] status should progress under international law, based on UN Security Council resolution 1244 (of 1999) which is a fundamental document for the Kosovo settlement certifying the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia, and based on the key provisions of the UN Charter and Helsinki Final Act, with the essential role of the UN Security Council bearing a predominant responsibility for safeguarding international peace and security".[204]
In a 3 December 2009 hearing at the ICJ, the Belarusian delegation said that secession by international law was allowed only in former colonies, or in cases where the minority population was oppressed for a long period of time and was denied the participation in government, however the situation in Kosovo has not met these criteria traditionally interpreted as the right for "external" self-determination. The internal law of Serbia as well as UNSC resolutions are satisfactory for the "internal" self-determination of the Albanian population.[195]
In May 2012 the Belarusian ambassador to Serbia, Uladzimir Chushaw, said that Belarus will never recognise the independence of Kosovo. He was quoted as saying, "The Kosovo wounds are hurting us very much."[205]

 Bolivia
In February 2008, Bolivian president Evo Morales refused to recognise Kosovo's independence and compared Kosovo separatists to the leaders of four eastern Bolivian states who have demanded greater autonomy from the federal government.[208]
In a 4 December 2009 hearing at the ICJ, the Bolivian delegation said that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia and that the Republic of Kosovo does not exist. A unilateral declaration of independence cannot change the international regime established by the UNSC resolution, or decide the outcome of negotiations.[209]

In March 2011, Skelemani said that Botswana still has to advise itself properly in order to come up with an informed decision on the issue. He said that the matter of Kosovo has been before the ICJ and therefore it requires a close look as it involves law.[212] In September 2013, Botswana Foreign Minister Phandu TC Skelemani, promised the recognition of Kosovo stating that it was now only a matter of procedure before it happens.[213]
In September 2014, Skelemani said that his country values as positive the developments in Kosovo, which pave the way to the possibility for reviewing of recognition by his country.[214]

In February 2009, Secretary of State at Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Cambodia, Ouch Borith, reiterated an earlier Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement that Kosovo is a sensitive issue which they are studying carefully. Borith questioned, "if Kosovo is recognized, what about South Ossetia?"[216] On 2 April 2009, the Director of the Department of International Organizations at Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Cambodia, Tuy Ri, stated that Cambodia had no plans to file a brief (either supportive of Serbia or Kosovo) in the ICJ case.[217]

 Cyprus
On 11 February 2008, the Cypriot Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou-Marcoullis, stated that "Cyprus will never recognize a unilateral declaration of independence outside the U.N. framework, and in particular by side-stepping the role of the Security Council".[232] The President of Cyprus Dimitris Christofias, confirmed in March 2008 that Cyprus would not recognise Kosovo as an independent country, out of respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Serbia.[233] Christofias reiterated his opposition to recognition in an interview with a Russian newspaper, saying, "The one thing that Kosovo and Cyprus have in common, as far as the situation in these regions is concerned, is that in both cases, the basic principles of international law and legality, as well as UN decisions, are constantly being violated". The Cypriot president underlined that the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of both Serbia and Cyprus were being violated in the most brutal manner.[234]
On 23 February 2009, in a meeting with Serbian president Boris Tadić, Christofias said that "Cyprus has not recognized the unilaterally declared independence of Kosovo and we will not recognize it in the future. We are on your side, not only because your case is similar to ours, but because it is a matter of principles".[235] On 16 June 2009, Minister of Defence of Cyprus Costas Papacostas said that Cyprus will never recognise the independence of Kosovo.[236][237] In October 2009 this stance was reiterated by Christofias who said Cyprus would not recognise Kosovo, even if all other EU members did so.[238]

The Foreign Minister of Georgia, David Bakradze, said on 18 February 2008 that Tbilisi would not recognise Kosovo's independence, adding: "I think everyone in Georgia, regardless of political orientation, is unanimous on this".[254][255][256] On 29 March 2008 the prime minister, Lado Gurgenidze, gave a recorded interview in Estonia, in which he clearly said in English that as Georgia's friends have recognised Kosovo, it is only natural that eventually Georgia will do likewise. The printed publication of the interview elicited demands by the opposition to impeach him, and the government spokesman stated that the prime minister was misinterpreted, after which the Estonian paper Postimees, which conducted and printed the interview, released the audio to the world.[257] On 9 May 2008 President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, said "We are saying loud and clear that we have never planned to recognize Kosovo. Nor do we plan to do so in the future. The way out of the situation that has been chosen is not the best one. The Serbs should have been given more time for negotiations. The solution for Kosovo was a hasty one".[258]

Frankly speaking, the United Nations divided one of its members into two parts, though Article 1244 confirms the territorial integrity of Serbia. This is a very strange event. We think that some countries try to weaken international organizations. Presently, Iran is studying the question of Kosovo's future. Iran ... expresses its concern over the weakening of international organizations".[263]
In April 2012 during a visit in Belgrade Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Ramin Mehmanparast said that Iran will adhere to its decision not to recognise independence of Kosovo. Tehran on this issue is very clear and Iran is thereby giving its support to stability and safety in the region, Mehmanparast said. Mehmanparast added that Iran supported the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue as it believes that the international law can channel the burning issues in the best manner possible.[264] In a 5 August 2012 interview, the Ambassador of Iran to Albania, Ali Amouei, said that he believes the sustainable way out of the Kosovo issue is talks with Serbia, and that Iran will not hesitate to officially recognise Kosovo once it has concluded that it would serve to establish peace and stability in the Balkans and the realisation of the legitimate rights of Muslims in Kosovo.[265]
In February 2013, Amouei said that if the OIC concludes unanimously that recognising Kosovo helps peace and stability in the region, Iran will not avoid the recognition. He said that Iran's good relations with Serbia and Russia do not affect their position on Kosovo.[266]


 Iraq
At a meeting on 28 May 2009 with Kosovo's Foreign Minister, Skënder Hyseni, the representative of Iraq to the UN, Hamid Al Bayati, reportedly said that Kosovo deserves to be recognised by other states and that Iraq's decision to recognise will come at a suitable time.[267] At a meeting in September 2009 with Hyseni, Iraqi Foreign Minister, Hoshyar Zebari, said that Kosovo's request for recognition was being studied closely.

He also said that Iraqi authorities follow the developments in Kosovo with great care.[275]


 Israel
"We haven't decided when we're going to decide, and instead will monitor events and consider the issue," an unnamed Israeli Foreign Ministry official was quoted by the Jerusalem Post in February 2008.[276] Israel will not recognise Kosovo's independence at this time, in part because of the possibility of Palestinians using recognition of Kosovo to justify their own unilateral declaration of independence.[277] According to The Jewish Chronicle, Foreign Ministry officials and politicians are privately voicing a general sympathy towards the Kosovar cause, however Israel still won't recognise Kosovo.[278] Knesset representative Ruhama Avraham said that "at present the government of Israel has made decision not to join the group of countries which recognised the independence of Kosovo". She also said that Israel considers the situation "very disturbing".[279]
On 28 April 2009, Arthur Koll, the Israeli ambassador to Serbia, said it had been more than a year since Kosovo unilaterally declared independence, and that Israel had no intention of recognising that independence and that "Israel is asked from time to time how solid this decision is, but the fact is that Israel's position has not changed throughout this time. The Serbian people and government should appreciate Israel's position, which also demonstrates the friendship between the two states".[280][281] On 16 September 2009, Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman said that Israel is "monitoring the situation between Serbia and Kosovo" and that Israel hopes for "a really comprehensive and peaceful solution" which would be established through negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina. Lieberman said that his country would be able to withstand the pressure made on it to recognise Kosovo because Israel has "been under pressure since 1948 on many issues and we know how to deal with any pressure".[282] "Israeli officials have confirmed that Israel will remain firm in its stand [on Kosovo]," Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dačić said during a visit to Israel in late October 2009.[283]
In June 2011, Lieberman said that Kosovo's independence is a "sensitive issue" and that Israel may recognise Kosovo after other countries like Greece and Spain accept it.[284]
On 3 August 2012, during the opening of Israeli Embassy in Tirana, Lieberman, when asked about Kosovo, said that his country is in a delicate situation.[285] In August 2012, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister, Danny Ayalon, stated that Israel was considering recognising Kosovo, with a decision expected as soon as the following year.[286] In December 2012, the Israeli Ambassador to Albania, David Cohen, said that Israel has not recognised Kosovo yet, but it is working on this issue and that although it does not have known trade relations with Kosovo, it does give visa facilitation for Kosovars.[287]

 Mali
Mali's president Amadou Toumani Touré was reported in the press in March 2008 as having expressed the Malian stance on Kosovo as follows: "International norms must be respected, because their abuse and the violation of territorial integrity could threaten a series of countries with a similar problem".[307]
In a 21 May 2010 meeting with Serbian prime minister, Mirko Cvetković, Mali's Foreign Minister, Moctar Ouane, said that Serbia can count on Mali's support in its efforts to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity.[308]
In August 2011 meeting with Kosovo's First deputy prime minister Behgjet Pacolli, Touré is reported to have said that recognition of Kosovo will be seriously considered by Mali.[309]
Following the August 2012 publication of a note verbale recognising Kosovo's independence, purportedly signed by acting President of Mali, Dioncounda Traoré,[310] state run media in Mali issued a statement in which the Presidency of Mali denied recognising Kosovo and claimed that the document was a fabrication.[311] Pacolli claimed that the Malian Army, who had recently seized control of the state in a coup d'état due to dissatisfaction over the governments handling of their own separatist uprising in Azawad, had intervened to reverse the recognition granted by the civilian president.[312] On Pacolli's return to Mali to seek clarification on the issue, state leaders promised to reconfirm their recognition.[313]


 Mauritius
On 8 May 2008, Mauritian Secretary General for Foreign Affairs, Anand Neewoor, stated that the Government of Mauritius would not recognise Kosovo any time soon because of their concerns that it would have implications for their "fight to regain the Chagos Islands". Neewoor said of a few African countries that had recognised Kosovo, that they were "only countries without concerns of split away regions".[314] On 28 August 2008, Patrice Cure, head of the Multilateral Division at the Mauritian Foreign Ministry, indicated no willingness by his government to reconsider its stance on Kosovo, continuing to hold the line connecting Kosovo to Chagos issues.[315]
In June 2009, the Mauritian prime minister, Navin Ramgoolam, had called the US Embassy in Port Louis to say that he had decided that Mauritius would recognise Kosovo, despite opposition from his foreign ministry.[316]

We have been and remain close to Kosovo; I can tell you that my country is having wide consult[ation]s with other countries on the issue of Kosovo recognition. We will make a decision for Kosovo at [the] right time".[323] In May 2009, the Moroccan Director of Bilateral Affairs responsible for Europe, Abdellah Zagour, said that for the moment, Morocco does not intend to recognise Kosovo. He described his government's position as moderate, explaining that Morocco is waiting for a majority of the fifty-seven Organisation of Islamic Conference member states to recognise Kosovo before it would seriously review such a step. "We are not against an independent Kosovo," he stated, continuing that Morocco must consider Kosovo recognition through the lens of its concerns in Western Sahara.[324] During a September 2009 visit to Rabat, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić said that Moroccan leaders had confirmed that Rabat had consolidated its position on not recognising Kosovo. Morocco's Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi Fihri stated that entities could not become states by unilateral declarations of independence, but only through UN processes or mutual consent.[325]
In June 2011, Moroccan government representatives explained that they had difficulty in recognising Kosovo due to the political context of Western Sahara.[326]
On 6 July 2012, Morocco's Foreign Minister, Saad-Eddine El Othmani pledged that the highest state institutions would review a request for recognition by Kosovo, and a decision on recognition would be made within an appropriate period.[327] In an 8 October 2012 meeting between the Prime Ministers of Albania and Morocco, Sali Berisha and Abdelilah Benkirane, Mr. Benkirane promised to consider a request from the Albanian authorities to recognise Kosovo as it is a very important subject for the region.[328]

   Nepal
A leaked 2009 cable from the US Embassy in Kathmandu states that during a meeting with US Assistant Secretary Richard Boucher, the Foreign Secretary of Nepal, Gyan Chandra Acharya, said that the Government of Nepal had yet to decide if it would recognise the independence of Kosovo.

 Nicaragua
In February 2008, the Chancellor of Nicaragua, Samuel Santos, said that the government of his country maintains a position of "observation" to the unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo. "Nicaragua is watching the issue of Kosovo's independence, we have friends who are in agreement with this independence and other friends who disagree, there are some who are saying that [independence] is a threat to peace in that tender area. We just look at [this case and] we have no opinion on this issue."[335]


 Nigeria
In July 2009, Umaru Yar'Adua, President of Nigeria, said that Nigeria will not recognise Kosovo as an independent nation. He said the decision not to recognise Kosovo was informed by Nigeria's historical experience of the civil war of 1967 to 1970, fought to maintain its territorial integrity and sovereignty saying that "Since the end of the civil war, Nigeria has continued to embark on nation-building policies and strategies to forge a heterogeneous, yet inclusive nation".[336]

In August 2011, Kosovo's First Deputy Prime Minister Behgjet Pacolli said that he had received from senior Nigerian state leaders support and guarantee that Kosovo recognition would be seriously dealt with in a short period of time.[338]
Reports of Nigeria recognising Kosovo appeared in 2011.[16][339] In a 22 September 2011 statement, a spokesman for the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Damian Agwu, said that the Nigerian Federal Government had decided to "open a trade office in Pristina".[340] However, the following day the Ministry reversed course and said no trade office would be opened.[341]
It was reported in September 2012 that Olugbenga Ashiru, Nigerian Foreign Minister, had denied that the recognition took place.[342] Behgjet Pacolli, the First Deputy Prime Minister of Kosovo, reiterated that the recognition occurred and claimed that Ashiru never spoke with the Gazeta Express.[343]
In January 2013, former Foreign Minister of Kosovo Skënder Hyseni said that the recognitions by Nigeria and Uganda were "contested, not only by the respective states, but also by the US State Department".

 Paraguay
In February 2008, the Ministry of Foreign Relations of Paraguay published a statement saying that Paraguay took note of the independence declaration and was analysing the situation.[346]
In April 2010, it was reported that the Paraguayan president had told Kosovan pilot James Berisha, who was on an awareness-raising journey around Central and South America, that Paraguay had already recognised Kosovo's independence but had not made this known so as not to jeopardise their relationship with Russia.[347]


 Philippines

He also said the Philippines is not willing to recognise Kosovo as an independent nation.[348] On 19 February 2008, Romulo stated that recognition could complicate peace talks with Muslim separatists in Mindanao. He said that "while the Philippines does not oppose the idea of independence for Kosovo, it would prefer a settlement ... taking into account the internationally accepted principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity".[349]
In a November 2012 meeting with Kosovo's Foreign Minister, Enver Hoxhaj, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary, Rafael E. Seguis, pledged support for Kosovo, saying that his country has full understanding for the independence of Kosovo and that he would consider the request for recognition.[350]

On 18 February 2008, a joint session of the Parliament of Romania voted not to recognise Kosovo's independence by 357 to 27, with support from all parties except the UDMR. Also the President and the Prime Minister opposed recognition.[351][352]
In February 2009, Romanian Foreign Minister Cristian Diaconescu said that "Romania does not change its position and will not recognize Kosovo's independence, which contradicts to the norms and principles of the international law" and that the EP resolution on Kosovo is not binding.[353][354] In September 2009, President Traian Băsescu announced that Romania will partner Serbia in its action at the ICJ and said that "Territorial partitions are unacceptable, regardless of what explanations [are] put forward to support them."[355]
On 24 September 2010, Romanian prime minister Emil Boc said in an address to the UNGA that while Romania respected the ICJ's opinion on the legality of Kosovo's independence, it did not examine the key issue which was the legality of the creation of a new state. Romania will continue not to recognise Kosovo's independence.[356]
In March 2012 a majority of Romanian MEPs, including Elena Băsescu (the president's daughter), voted in favour of a resolution calling on the EU countries which had not recognised Kosovo to do so.[357] In April 2012, Diaconescu said "As far as we are concerned, we clearly stated our approach, which has not changed: Romania will not recognize this province because it does not meet all requirements of the international laws to function as a state. But, certainly, the situation must be analyzed especially through the perspective of the relation Belgrade will establish with this province".[358]
In April 2013, following a resolution by the European Parliament which urged all EU members states which had not recognised Kosovo to do so, Romania's Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that his country must follow the EU's lead.[359][360] In May 2015, Prime Minister Victor Ponta stated that "In 2008 Romania decided not to recognize Kosovo.

 Rwanda
On 11 February 2009, the Director of International Organisations at Rwanda's Foreign Ministry, Ben Rutsinga, said that the African Union had no unified position on Kosovo independence and that Rwanda would not reach an "individual determination" in advance of such a unified position.[363] On 18 September 2009, the Rwandan Foreign Minister, Rosemary Museminali, said that some countries would be likely to criticise a Rwandan recognition of Kosovo, accusing Rwanda of taking that stance in order to lay the basis for a similar breakaway by parts of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. She added that the Government of Kosovo had requested a meeting with her but she had not responded.[364]

 Spain

Main article: Spain's reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence
Spain is the only major country in Western Europe that has not recognised Kosovo, originally because of objections to the legality of its unilateral declaration of independence under international law, and also due to concerns about possible implications regarding its own issues with domestic independence movements. Although it has given indications that its stance may change, increasing political tensions make it unlikely that Spain will soften its current position.


 Sri Lanka
In February 2008, the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka called Kosovo's declaration of independence a violation of the UN Charter and emphasised its concern that the act "could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations, the established global order of sovereign States and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security".[381]
In a June 2009 meeting with Serbian president Boris Tadić, Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa re-affirmed his country's solidarity with Serbia and stated that Sri Lanka remained firmly opposed to Kosovo's independence as it threatened the international order.

In February 2009, Jamaluddin Ubaidulloev, Second Secretary of the Department of European and North American Affairs at the Foreign Ministry of Tajikistan, said that the Foreign Ministry could not offer an official position on the recognition of Kosovo because it had received no decision on the matter from the government. However in past conversations, the Head of the European and North American Affairs at the Ministry, Khusrav Nosiri, had commented that Tajikistan wished to avoid the question of Kosovo recognition because of perceived parallels with the question of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[390]

 Vietnam
In February 2008, the Vietnamese UN Ambassador Le Luong Minh "reaffirmed Vietnam policy that the fact that Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence is not a correct implementation of the U.N.

In March 2008, Zambian Foreign Minister, Kabinga Pande, said that Zambia has not decided its position on the declaration of Kosovo's independence. Pande said the government needs more time to analyse the matter.[417]
On 12 February 2009, the Zambian Foreign Ministry Permanent Secretary, Tens Kapoma, and Zambia's Permanent Representative to the UN, Lazarous Kapambwe, did not rule out the possibility of Kosovo recognition, they indicated by their response that Zambia would be unlikely to do so in the immediate future. Zambian Government Representatives expressed reservations about the legal precedence that Kosovo recognition would establish. In particular, they conveyed some concern about the domestic legal ramifications vis-a-vis the Lozi tribe, an ethnic group in western Zambia within which remains some support for greater autonomy or full independence. Kapambwe implied that the US recognition of Kosovo is inconsistent with its refusal to recognise South Ossetian and Abkhazian secession from Georgia. Kapambwe suggested that Zambia could be persuaded to recognise Kosovo if Kosovo or the international community could establish that Kosovo meets four conditions for national sovereignty, according to the criteria for statehood laid down in the Montevideo Convention.[418]
In a September 2010 meeting with Kosovo's Foreign Minister, Skënder Hyseni, Mr. Pande said that Zambia is carefully studying the opinion of the ICJ and that the request for recognition will be processed soon.[419] In a subsequent meeting with the Albanian Foreign Minister, Edmond Haxhinasto, Mr. Pande said that Kosovo's independence is an irreversible reality and that the decision of the ICJ's opinion eased the decision on recognition of Kosovo for many African countries.[420]
On 27 February 2011, regarding a request to recognise Kosovo, Pande stated that "We will evaluate that request. It will have to undergo scrutiny like we always do".[421]
In September 2012, Zambian Foreign Minister, Given Lubinda, said that his country has no reason not to recognise Kosovo.[422]
Zambia's Minister of Home Affairs, Edgar Lungu, stated in December 2013 that his government will thoroughly discuss and clear all the grey areas before any decision can be made over Kosovo,[423] and that recognition of Kosovo was Zambia's priority.[424]

In February 2008 Abkhazian de facto president Sergei Bagapsh, regards "the promotion of Kosovo by the U.S.A. and some European states towards the declaration of independence as a visible demonstration of the policy of double standards". "Why does not the world community put any attention to the violent actions against ethnic minorities living in Kosovo..., the lack of interethnic reconciliation...", Sergey Bagapsh noted. "We are solidly convinced of the fact that [now] we have got an even wider moral base for the recognition of our independence."[427] On 5 September 2008, the Abkhazian Foreign Minister Sergei Shamba said he was ready to recognise Kosovo's independence, "if Kosovo agrees to recognize our own (Abkhazia) independence, we will certainly recognize them as well".[428][429]


 Artsakh
In February 2008, Georgiy Petrosyan, Foreign Minister of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, said that he does not regard the conflict between his motherland and Azerbaijan, and the conflict between Kosovo and Serbia as completely similar. He noted that "approaches and solutions, which have recommended themselves while regulating one problem, can be used when looking for a solution to another one". Petrosyan stated that "the recognition of independent Kosovo will become an additional factor strengthening the status of [the] Stepanakert government" that he represents.[430] On 12 March 2008 following Kosovo's declaration of independence, the National Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh adopted a statement calling on the world's parliaments to be consistent in their recognition of states established on the basis of the right for self-determination and not to use double standards. The statement commended the stance of the international community respecting the human and civil rights of the majority of Kosovo's population.[431]
In December 2011, it was reported that Vasily Atajanyan, the acting foreign minister of Nagorno-Karabakh, had said that Nagorno-Karabakh would recognise Kosovo if recognition were reciprocated. In response, Enver Hoxhaj, Foreign Minister of Kosovo, said that Kosovo can only have formal relations with members of the UN.[432]


 Holy See

Main article: Holy See's reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence
The reaction of the Holy See has been unclear. Since Kosovo's declaration there has been information suggesting de facto recognition, and information suggesting that this was not the case.


 Northern Cyprus
In February 2008, the President of Northern Cyprus Mehmet Ali Talat welcomed Kosovo's independence, but a presidential spokesman said that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was not planning to recognise Kosovo.[433][434][435]


 Palestine
In February 2008, two senior Palestinian officials representing the Mahmoud Abbas West Bank-controlling government, who also are part of the team negotiating with Israel, disagreed on what the Kosovo events implied for Palestine. Yasser Abed Rabbo said, "If things are not going in the direction of continuous and serious negotiations, then we should take the step and announce our independence unilaterally. Kosovo is not better than us. We deserve independence even before Kosovo, and we ask for the backing of the United States and the European Union for our independence". Saeb Erekat responded that the Palestine Liberation Organization had already declared independence in 1988. "Now we need real independence, not a declaration," said Erekat, "We need real independence by ending the occupation. We are not Kosovo. We are under Israeli occupation and for independence we need to acquire independence".[436]
During a July 2009 state visit to Serbia, President of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, when discussing both the situations in the Middle East and Kosovo said, "We are looking for a way to resolve these problems in a peaceful way, by upholding international law. We cannot impose solutions nor can we accept imposed solutions. That is why we must negotiate".[437][438]
In June 2011, Khraishi Ibrahim, Palestine's representative to the UN in Geneva, stated that Palestine supports Kosovo's integration into the European and international communities, and supports its independence.[439] In September 2011, during the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Belgrade, the Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour said that Palestine was a "typical foreign occupation which cannot be compared to the issue of Kosovo" as confirmed by international law and the UN.[440][441]


 Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic
The Polisario Front, which governs the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, has stated that the speedy recognition of Kosovo's independence by many countries shows the double standards of the international community, considering that the Western Sahara issue remains unsolved after three decades.[442]


 Somaliland
In 2010, the President of Somaliland, Ahmed Mahamoud Silanyo, said, "We are heartened by Kosovo and what's happened to Southern Sudan that means it opens the door for us. The principle that countries should remain as they were at the time of independence has changed so why should it not work for us as well".[443]


 South Ossetia
In February 2008, the South Ossetian de facto president, Eduard Kokoity, stated that it is not fair to compare this breakaway region with Kosovo because South Ossetians have far more right to a state of their own than Kosovo Albanians. He said that "Kosovo Albanians got independence after NATO's aggression on Serbia. Americans and NATO member countries took away Serbia's province. I feel sincerely for the Serb people," and that "Serbs had a well-organized state that provided for a normal life for Albanians. For this reason, what Americans have done to the Serbs is injustice".[444]


 Transnistria
Transnistria has no policy towards Kosovo, but the Transnistrian Foreign Ministry has said that "The declaration and recognition of Kosovo are of fundamental importance, since thereby a new conflict settlement model has been established, based on the priority of people's right to self-determination. Pridnestrovie [Transnistria] holds that this model should be applicable to all conflicts which have similar political, legal, and economic bases".[445]


Positions taken by intergovernmental organisations[edit]
Main article: Membership of Kosovo in international organizations
Intergovernmental organisations do not themselves diplomatically recognise any state; their member states do so individually. However, depending on the intergovernmental organisation's rules of internal governance and the positions of their member states, they may express positive or negative opinions as to declarations of independence, or choose to offer or withhold membership to a partially recognised state.


International organisation
Position


 Arab League
In May 2009, the Secretary General of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, welcomed a request by Kosovo's Foreign Minister, Skënder Hyseni, to establish regular communications.[446] At a meeting on 18 June 2009 with Hyseni, the representative of the Arab League to the UN, Yahya A. Mahmassani, said that the Kosovo issue is being discussed at the Arab League, and that there would be gradual movement towards recognition as most Arab states are supportive of Kosovo.[197]

 Caribbean Community (CARICOM)
In August 2010, Albanian Parliament Speaker Jozefina Topalli received a letter from the chairman of the Grenadian Parliament, George J. McGuire, stating that CARICOM members would soon make a joint decision on the recognition of Kosovo.[447]
On 19 August 2011, it was reported that the CARICOM members had made a joint decision to recognise Kosovo, but that each state would announce official recognition separately.[448]

 ‡ – British Overseas Territory; the UK (which recognises Kosovo) represents its foreign affairs.






 Council of Europe (CoE)
Kosovo plans to apply for membership in the CoE since it considers that it fulfills the statutory requirements to do so. If Kosovo receives positive votes from 2/3 of the member countries, it will be admitted to the CoE. Kosovo has already been recognised by 2/3 of the CoE members, thus it should be able to join the organisation.[449][450][451]
In May 2012, the Chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the CoE, Edmond Haxhinasto, pledged to work for a stronger role for Kosovo during the Albanian chairmanship of the Council.[452] Haxhinasto added that Kosovo would in the near future be a part of the family of states of the Council of Europe.[453] However, the Secretary-General of the CoE, Thorbjørn Jagland, commented that membership of Kosovo depends on the willingness of members.[454]
The Council of Europe Development Bank's Board of Directors voted in favour of Kosovo's membership on 14 June 2013 during their meeting in Malta.[455]
In June 2014, Kosovo became a member state of the Venice Commission, an advisory body of the Council of Europe.[456]

European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
A resolution, agreeing to the membership of Kosovo in the EBRD, was approved by its Board of Governors on 16 November 2012, providing that, by 17 December 2012, it has completed the necessary internal procedures.[457][458] On 8 February 2013, Kosovo's Foreign Minister, Enver Hoxhaj, and the President of EBRD, Suma Chakrabarti, signed an agreement on economic cooperation and activities.[459]


 European Union (EU)
The EU, like other IGOs, does not possess the legal capacity to diplomatically recognise any state; member states do so individually. The majority of member states have recognised Kosovo. To articulate a common EU policy of either support or opposition to Kosovo's independence would require unanimity on the subject from all 28 member states, which does not presently exist. On 18 February 2008, the EU officially stated that it would "take note" of the resolution of the Kosovo assembly.[460] The EU is sending a EULEX mission to Kosovo, which includes a special representative and 2,000 police and judicial personnel.[461][462]
Although the European Parliament is not formally vested with the authority to shape the EU's foreign policy, it was seen to be expressing its acceptance of Kosovan independence when it hosted the Kosovan Assembly in an interparliamentary meeting on 30 May 2008. This was also the first time Kosovo's flag was officially hoisted at an EU institution.[463][464] On 5 February 2009, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that encouraged all EU member states to recognise Kosovo. The resolution also welcomed the successful deployment of EULEX across Kosovo, and rejected the possibility of Kosovo's partition. It was passed with 424 voted in favour, and 133 against. Some Romanian and Communist representatives called for a new international conference on Kosovo's status or to allow the northern part of the country to join Serbia.[465][466]
On 8 July 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution welcoming "the recognition by all Member States of the independence of Kosovo", and stating that EU Member States should "step up their common approach towards Kosovo". The resolution rejected the possibility of a partition of Kosovo.[467]
On 29 March 2012, the European Parliament adopted a resolution that urged the five EU member states that had not recognised Kosovo's independence to do so.[468]

International Monetary Fund (IMF)
On 15 July 2008, the IMF issued a statement saying "It has been determined that Kosovo has seceded from Serbia as a new independent state and that Serbia is the continuing state," thus acknowledging the separation of Kosovo from Serbia.[469] After their membership was approved in a secret ballot by 108 states,[470] Kosovo signed the IMF's Articles of Agreement on 29 June 2009 to become a full member of the fund.[471][472]


Interpol
At a meeting on 19 February 2017 with Kosovo's President, Hashim Thaçi, Secretary General of Interpol, Jürgen Stock, said that Interpol is open for Kosovo membership.[473]


International Organization for Migration (IOM)
At a meeting on 30 March 2012 with Kosovo's Deputy Foreign Minister, Petrit Selimi, Deputy Director of the IOM, Laura Thomson, expressed readiness to continue advanced discussions with the representatives of Kosovo to further advance the prospects for membership.[474]


 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
NATO maintains that its ongoing Kosovo Force mission and mandate remain unchanged and that "NATO reaffirms that KFOR shall remain in Kosovo on the basis of UNSCR 1244, as agreed by Foreign Ministers in December 2007, unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise".[475]

 Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)
In February 2008, Secretary General of the OIC Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu said "Kosovo has finally declared its independence after a long and determined struggle by its people. As we rejoice this happy result, we declare our solidarity with and support to our brothers and sisters there. The Islamic Umma wishes them success in their new battle awaiting them which is the building of a strong and prosperous a state capable of satisfying of its people".[476] The OIC did not call on its individual member states to extend recognition, as some member states, including Azerbaijan, Egypt, Indonesia and Sudan, were firmly against any issuance of such a statement.[477]
On 25 May 2009, at the OIC's 36th session of the Council of Foreign Ministers in Damascus, the 57 member states adopted a resolution that noted Kosovo's declaration of independence, upheld the role of the UN in Kosovo, reaffirmed the strong interest of the OIC regarding Muslims in the Balkans, welcomed the co-operation of Kosovo with the OIC Economic and Financial institutions, and called on the international community to continue contributing to the fostering of Kosovo's economy.[478] It has been reported that an earlier draft of the resolution (tabled by Saudi Arabia) had called for recognition of Kosovo by Islamic countries, but this was rejected by some member states, including Syria, Egypt and Azerbaijan.[479] The OIC mechanism is similar to the one adopted by the EU which leaves it up to member states to decide.[480]
In June 2011, the OIC adopted a resolution calling on member states to consider recognising Kosovo but once again it left the recognition issue to individual member states.[481]
In November 2012, the OIC adopted a resolution calling on member states to consider recognising Kosovo based on their free and sovereign rights as well as on their national practice.[482] İhsanoğlu expressed support for strengthening the international subjectivity of the Republic of Kosovo.[483]
In February 2013, the OIC renewed the previous resolution and urged all of its member states to recognise Kosovo.[484]

 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
On 19 February 2008, Chairman Ilkka Kanerva and OSCE Minorities Commissioner Knut Vollebæk called for Kosovo's government to vigorously implement agreed-upon frameworks regarding minorities.[485] Serbia has vowed to oppose OSCE membership for Kosovo and is calling for the organisation to condemn the declaration of independence.[486]

 United Nations (UN)
Russia called an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council on 17 February 2008, but the council members, given differences in stated position between permanent members, failed to reach a consensus. Russia requested another meeting on 18 February. In March 2008 the UNMIK mission in Kosovo told the Serbian government to cease its interference in North Kosovo after local Serbs burned down a customs office set up by the Republic of Kosovo.[487] In order for Kosovo to attain a UN seat, it would require the agreement of the five permanent members of the Security Council, of which only three currently recognise Kosovo: UK, France, and the US.
On 17 January 2012, the President of Kosovo, Atifete Jahjaga, had a meeting with the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, who stated that he will continue to support Kosovo in all initiatives and processes through which it is running.[488] On 11 July 2012, the elected President of the United Nations General Assembly, Serb Vuk Jeremić, said that Kosovo's move to join the UN during his upcoming presidency of the UN General Assembly would be "an act of pointless provocation". "As long as Serbia presides over the UN, and that's for the next year, this could only happen over my dead body," Jeremić said.[489] However, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that Jeremić should have stated this as an official of Serbia, not as the President of the UN General Assembly.[490]

Positions taken by other actors[edit]
Autonomous regions and secessionist movements[edit]


Entity
Position


 Balochistan
In August 2010, Baloch separatist leader Jumma Khan Marri welcomed the independence of Kosovo and the ruling by the ICJ that the declaration of independence by Kosovo was not in violation of international law. He also said that he hoped that the west would do the same thing and force Pakistan to give self-determination to the Baloch people.[493] In October 2010, former Minister of Fisheries and opposition member of the Balochistan Assembly Kachkol Ali hailed the decision of the International Court of Justice on Kosovo's declaration of Independence as "a glorious judgment for the national liberation movements". He said that it was a beacon of hope for enslaved nations.[494]


 Basque Government
The regional Basque government, unlike the central Spanish government in Madrid, responded very positively to Kosovo's declaration of independence. A regional government spokeswoman said that "It's a lesson to be followed when it comes to peaceful and democratic solutions of the identity and allegiance problems ... It shows that respect of the citizens' will is the key to solving difficult political problems".[495]


 Catalonia
In July 2010, following the ICJ decision, the Catalan nationalist parties expressed that there are clear parallels between their case and Kosovo's. Joan Puigcercós, the President of the Republican Left of Catalonia, stated that the ICJ decision shows that Catalonia's independence could be legal and recognised at an international level. The Democratic Convergence of Catalonia party asked the Spanish Government to recognise Kosovo's independence and the right of self-determination of the people.[496] On 23 July 2010, José Montilla, President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, said that Catalonia and Kosovo have little in common.[497]
In March 2012 during a fierce debate with Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, Convergence and Union general secretary Josep Antoni Duran i Lleida asked for the immediate recognition of Kosovo by Spain, and stated that the reasons for non-recognition "are not international but internal".[498]


 Central Tibetan Administration (government in exile)
In June 2008, an article was published on the website of the Central Tibetan Administration saying that if Kosovo has a right to independence then Tibet has every right to become an independent nation and Tibetans are fully entitled to the right of self-determination.[499]
In April 2010, the 14th Dalai Lama, then joint executive authority within the government in exile, sent a telegram of congratulations to Kosovo's prime minister, Hashim Thaçi, saying that he is satisfied with the independence of Kosovo and that he prays that Kosovo's democratic state will be a model for others to follow.[500]


 Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (government in exile)
Usman Ferzauli, the Foreign Minister of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, said that his country "welcome the declaration of state independence by Kosovo and do not question the right of the people of Kosovo to distance themselves from the state that terrorized it".[501]
The Prime Minister of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Akhmed Zakayev, stated in an April 2010 interview that to him and his nation, Kosovo represented a hope, and also made reference to a letter he had apparently sent to Kosovo's prime minister Hashim Thaçi congratulating the latter.[502]


 East Turkestan (government in exile)
On 18 February 2008, Ansar Yusuf Turani, the representative of the government-in-exile, released a press statement saying "On behalf of the people of East Turkistan, the East Turkistan Government in Exile hereby recognizes Kosovo as an independent and sovereign state and wishes peace and prosperity for the people of Kosovo".[503]


 Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front
On 11 March 2008, the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front staged a demonstration in Brussels in front of the European Commission building. It was headed by one of its leaders, Barrister Abdul Majeed Tramboo, and its agenda cited Kosovo's independence, demanding equal treatment and commensurate application of the same solution by the EU in the Kashmir dispute involving India, Pakistan and China. Protesters included EU Parliament members, students and various NGO constituents and representatives.[504]


 Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People (Crimea)
Mustafa Cemilev, the Chairman of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People declared that he supported the right of self-determination for every nation, including Kosovo.[505] He also added that the Crimean Tatars will not start a secession process from Ukraine if their rights are respected. Cemilev stated that he believes the motive for the Kosovars to declare independence was the anti-Albanian situation in Kosovo.[506]


International non-governmental organisations[edit]

International organisation
Position


European Broadcasting Union (EBU)
Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) is not an active member of the EBU and therefore they cannot participate in the Eurovision Song Contest and sister projects. However, there is a cooperation agreement between RTK and the EBU[507] and they were allowed to participate in the Eurovision Young Dancers 2011 competition.
On 30 March 2012 during a meeting in Geneva with Kosovo's Deputy Foreign Minister Petrit Selimi, Ingrid Delterne, Executive Director of the EBU expressed readiness for Kosovo's membership in the ITU.[474]


 International Olympic Committee (IOC)
The Olympic Committee of Kosovo became a full member of the International Olympic Committee on 9 December 2014.[508] The Olympic Committee of Kosovo has been in existence since 1992.[509] Kosovo was a provisional member of the IOC from 22 October 2014 through 9 December 2014.[510]


Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)
Kosovo played their first official match against Haiti in 2014. In April, 2016, Kosovo were voted into UEFA, and on the 13th of May, 2016, at the 66th FIFA congress in Mexico City, Kosovo (along with Gibraltar) were voted into the organisation. Only 23 associations voted against Kosovo's membership. They took part in their first World Cup qualifier in their 1-1 draw with Finland.


 Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO)
UNPO issued a statement on 18 February 2008: "for regions in similar conditions, Kosova's independence represents new hope for the future of their own potential statehood".[511]
In the days that followed, several African UNPO members expressed their own individual secession-minded reactions to Kosovo's independence.[512]


Norwegian Nobel Committee
After former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari received the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize "for his important efforts ... to resolve international conflicts",[513] including his work in Kosovo as a UN special envoy, the Norwegian Nobel Committee Secretary, who is also the Director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, Geir Lundestad, said that the committee believed "there is no alternative to an independent Kosovo".[514]


International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
Kosovo is not a member of the governing structures for the ISO.
Independently of its ISO membership status, ISO will also potentially issue a standardised country code for Kosovo. According to rules of procedure followed by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency based in Geneva, a new ISO 3166-1 code for Kosovo will only be issued once it appears in the UN Terminology Bulletin Country Names or in the UN Statistics Division's list of Country and Region Codes for Statistical Use.[515] To appear in the terminology bulletin, it must either (a) be admitted into the UN, (b) join a UN Specialised Agency or (c) become a state party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice.[516] Criterion (b) was met when Kosovo joined the International Monetary Fund and World Bank; a terminology bulletin has yet to be circulated.


Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
ICANN, through its Country Code Names Supporting Organization, is responsible for adding new country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) for use in Internet addressing. Rules of procedure dictate Kosovo must first receive an ISO 3166-1 code (discussed above) before the ccTLD can be introduced; speculation has centred on ".ks" as the likeliest candidate.[517][518]


International Road and Transport Union (IRU)
Kosovo officially became the 181st member of the IRU in May 2009.[519]


International Bar Association (IBA)
Kosovo officially became a member of the IBA on 28 May 2009.[520][521]
