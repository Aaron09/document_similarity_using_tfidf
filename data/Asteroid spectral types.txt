An asteroid spectral type is assigned to asteroids based on their emission spectrum, color, and sometimes albedo (reflectivity). These types are thought to correspond to an asteroid's surface composition. For small bodies that are not internally differentiated, the surface and internal compositions are presumably similar, while large bodies such as Ceres and Vesta are known to have internal structure. Over the years, there has been a number of surveys that resulted in a set of different taxonomic systems such as the Tholen, SMASS and Bus–DeMeo classification.[1]

Present-day classifications[edit]
The present-day classification was initiated by Clark R. Chapman, David Morrison, and Ben Zellner in 1975 with three categories:[2] C for dark carbonaceous objects, S for stony (silicaceous) objects, and U for those that did not fit into either C or S. This classification has since been expanded and clarified.
A number of classification schemes are currently in existence,[3] and while they strive to retain some mutual consistency, quite a few asteroids are sorted into different classes depending on the particular scheme. This is due to the use of different criteria for each approach. The two most widely used classifications are described below:

S3OS2[edit]
The Small Solar System Objects Spectroscopic Survey (S3OS2 or S3OS2) observed 820 asteroids, using the former ESO 1.52-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory during 1996–2001.[1] This survey applied both the Tholen and Bus–Binzel (SMASS) taxonomy to the observed objects, many of which had previously not been classified (the S3OS2-classification scheme may also be referred to as Lazzaro-classification). For the Tholen-like classification, the survey introduced a new "Caa-type", which shows a broad absorption band associated indicating an aqueous alteration of the body's surface. The Caa class corresponds to Tholen's C-type and to the SMASS' hydrated Ch-type (including some Cgh-, Cg-, and C-types), and was assigned 106 bodies or 13% of the surveyed objects. In addition, S3OS2 uses the K-class for both classification schemes, a type which does not exist in the original Tholen taxonomy.[1]
Tholen classification[edit]
The most widely used taxonomy for over a decade has been that of David J. Tholen, first proposed in 1984. This classification was developed from broad band spectra (between 0.31 μm and 1.06 μm) obtained during the Eight-Color Asteroid Survey (ECAS) in the 1980s, in combination with albedo measurements.[5] The original formulation was based on 978 asteroids.
The Tholen scheme includes 14 types with the majority of asteroids falling into one of three broad categories, and several smaller types. They are, with their largest exemplars:[citation needed]

C-group dark carbonaceous objects.

B-type (2 Pallas)
F-type (704 Interamnia)
G-type (1 Ceres)
C-type (10 Hygiea) the remaining majority of 'standard' C-type asteroids.


S-type (15 Eunomia, 3 Juno) silicaceous (or "stony") objects.
X-group

M-type (16 Psyche) metallic objects, the third most populous group.
E-type (44 Nysa, 55 Pandora) differ from M-type mostly by high albedo
P-type (259 Aletheia, 190 Ismene; CP: 324 Bamberga) differ from M-type mostly by low albedo



and the small classes:

A-type (246 Asporina)
D-type (624 Hektor)
T-type (96 Aegle)
Q-type (1862 Apollo)
R-type (349 Dembowska)
V-type (4 Vesta)

Inconsistent data[edit]
For inconsistent spectral data, the Tholen classification scheme uses the letter "I", which is not a formal spectral type. An example is the Themistian asteroid 515 Athalia, which had a spectrum of a stony, and an albedo of a carbonaceous asteroid at the time of classification.[6]
Multiple types[edit]
When the underlying numerical color analysis was ambiguous, objects were assigned two or three types rather than just one (e.g. "CG" or "SCT"), whereby the sequence of types reflects the order of increasing numerical standard deviation, with the best fitting spectral type mentioned first.[6] In case a qualifying flag for an unusual spectrum is used (see below), the Tholen taxonomy may then encompass up to four letters (e.g. "SCTU").
Flags[edit]
The Tholen taxonomy uses the following notations, appended to the spectral type:[6]

U → asteroid has an unusual spectrum, which falls far from cluster center
:  → noisy spectral data
:: → very noisy spectral data

For example, the Mars-crosser 1747 Wright has an AU: class, which means that it is an A-type asteroid, though with an unusual and noisy spectrum.
SMASS classification[edit]
This is a more recent taxonomy introduced by Schelte J. Bus and Richard P. Binzel in 2002, based on the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey (SMASS) of 1,447 asteroids.[7] This survey produced spectra of a far higher resolution than ECAS, and was able to resolve a variety of narrow spectral features. However, a somewhat smaller range of wavelengths (0.44 μm to 0.92 μm) was observed. Also, albedos were not considered. Attempting to keep to the Tholen taxonomy as much as possible given the differing data, asteroids were sorted into the 26 types given below. The majority of bodies fall again into the three broad C, S, and X categories, with a few unusual bodies categorized into several smaller types:

C-group of carbonaceous objects including:[citation needed]

B-type largely overlapping with the Tholen B and F types.
C-type the most 'standard' of the non-B carbonaceous objects
Cg Ch Cgh somewhat related to the Tholen G type
Cb transition objects between plain C and B types.


S-group of silicaceous (stony) objects including:

A-type
Q-type
R-type
K-type a new category (181 Eucharis, 221 Eos)
L-type a new category (83 Beatrix)
S-type the most 'standard' of the S group
Sa, Sq, Sr, Sk, and Sl transition objects between plain S and the other types in the group.


X-group of mostly metallic objects including:

X-type the most 'standard' of the X group including objects classified by Tholen as M, E, or P-type.
Xe, Xc, and Xk transition types between plain X and the appropriately lettered types.


T-type
D-type
Ld-type: a new type with more extreme spectral features than the L-type
O-type a small category (3628 Božněmcová)
V-type (4 Vesta)

A significant number of small asteroids were found to fall in the Q, R, and V types, which were represented by only a single body in the Tholen scheme. In this Bus and Binzel SMASS scheme only a single type was assigned to any particular asteroid.
A few near-Earth objects have spectra that differ strongly from any of the SMASS classes. This is presumably because these bodies are much smaller than those detected in the asteroid belt, and as such may have younger less-altered surfaces or be composed of a less varied mix of minerals.[citation needed]
 Color indices[edit]
Main articles: Color index and UBV photometric system
For the taxonomic classes BB, BR, IR and RR, used for non-asteroid minor planets, see Trans-Neptunian object § Spectra.
In a photometric system, the brightness of an object can be measured through a set of different, wavelength-specific filters (passbands). In the UBV photometric system, three different filters are used:

U: passband for the ultraviolet light
B: passband for the blue light
V: passband sensitive to visible light, more specifically the green-yellow portion of the visible light

In an observation, the brightness of an object is measured twice through a different filter. The resulting difference in magnitude is called the color index. The U–B or B–V color indices are the most common ones. In addition, the R–I index, where the photometric letters stand for "red" (R) and infrared (I), is also used.

Appraisal[edit]
These classification schemes are expected to be refined and/or replaced as further research progresses. However, for now the spectral classification based on the two above coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys from the 1990s is still the standard. Scientists have been unable to agree on a better taxonomic system, largely due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed measurements consistently for a large sample of asteroids (e.g. finer resolution spectra, or non-spectral data such as densities would be very useful).
Some groupings of asteroids have been correlated with meteorite types:

C-type – Carbonaceous chondrite meteorites
S-type – Stony meteorites
M-type – Iron meteorites
V-type – HED meteorites
