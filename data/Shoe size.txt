World's largest pair of shoes, Riverbank Center, Philippines—5.29 metres (17.4 ft) long and 2.37 metres (7.75 ft) wide, equivalent to a French shoe size of 753


A shoe size is an indication of the fitting size of a shoe for a person.
There are a number of different shoe-size systems used worldwide. While all of them use a number to indicate the length of the shoe, they differ in exactly what they measure, what unit of measurement they use, and where the size 0 (or 1) is positioned. Some systems also indicate the shoe width, sometimes also as a number, but in many cases by one or more letters. Some regions use different shoe-size systems for different types of shoes (e.g. men's, women's, children's, sport, and safety shoes). This article sets out several complexities in the definition of shoe sizes. In practice, shoes should be tried on for size and fit before they are purchased.

Deriving the shoe size[edit]
Foot versus shoe and last[edit]
The length of a foot is commonly defined as (a) the distance between two parallel lines that are perpendicular to the foot and (b) in contact with the most prominent toe and the most prominent part of the heel. Foot length is measured with the subject standing barefoot and the weight of the body equally distributed between both feet.
The sizes of the left and right feet are often slightly different. In this case, both feet are measured, and purchasers of mass-produced shoes are advised to purchase a shoe size based on the larger foot, as most retailers do not sell pairs of shoes in non-matching sizes.
Each size of shoe is considered suitable for a small interval of foot lengths. The inner cavity of a shoe must typically be 15–20 mm longer than the foot, but this varies between different types of shoes.
A shoe-size system can refer to three characteristic lengths:

The median length of feet for which a shoe is suitable. For customers, this measure has the advantage of being directly related to their body measures. It applies equally to any type, form, or material of shoe. However, this measure is less popular with manufacturers,[citation needed] because it requires them to test carefully for each new shoe model, for which range of foot sizes it is recommendable. It puts on the manufacturer the burden of ensuring that the shoe will fit a foot of a given length.
The length of the inner cavity of the shoe. This measure has the advantage that it can be measured easily on the finished product. However, it will vary with manufacturing tolerances and only gives the customer very crude information about the range of foot sizes for which the shoe is suitable.
The length of the "last", the foot-shaped template over which the shoe is manufactured. This measure is the easiest one for the manufacturer to use, because it identifies only the tool used to produce the shoe. It makes no promise about manufacturing tolerances or for what size of foot the shoe is actually suitable. It leaves all responsibility and risk of choosing the correct size with the customer. Further, the last can be measured in several different ways resulting in different measurements.[1]

All these measures differ substantially from one another for the same shoe.
Length[edit]
Sizing systems also differ in what units of measurement they use. This also results in different increments between shoe sizes, because usually only "full" or "half" sizes are made.
The following length units are commonly used today to define shoe-size systems:

The Paris point equates to ​2⁄3 centimetre (about 6.7 mm or 0.26 in). That is the increment between whole sizes, and about 3.3 mm or 0.13 in between half sizes. This unit is commonly used in Continental Europe.
The barleycorn is an old English unit that equates to ​1⁄3 inch (8.47 mm). This is the basis for current UK and US shoe sizes, with the largest shoe size taken as twelve inches (a size 12) i.e. 30.5 cm, and then counting backwards in barleycorn units, so a size 11 is 11.67 inches or 29.6 cm.
metric measurements in centimetres (cm) or millimetres (mm) are used in the international Mondopoint system and in the Asian system.

Zero point[edit]
The sizing systems also place size 0 (or 1) at different locations:

Size 0 as a foot's length of 0. The shoe size is directly proportional to the length of the foot in the chosen unit of measurement. Sizes of children's, men's, and women's shoes, as well as sizes of different types of shoes, can be compared directly. This is used with the Mondopoint and the Asian system.
Size 0 as the length of the shoe's inner cavity of 0. The shoe size is then directly proportional to the inner length of the shoe. This is used with systems that also take the measurement from the shoe. While sizes of children's, men's and women's shoes can be compared directly, this is not necessarily true for different types of shoes that require a different amount of "wiggle room" in the toe box. This is used with the Continental European system.
Size 0 (or 1) can just be simply a shoe of a given length. Typically this will be the shortest length deemed practical; but this can be different for children's, teenagers', men's, and women's shoes - making it impossible to compare sizes. For example, a women's shoe at size 8 is a different length from a men's shoe at size 8 in the US system, but not the British.

Width[edit]
Some systems also include the width of a foot, but do so in a variety of ways:

Measured width in millimetres (mm). This is done with the Mondopoint system.
Measured width as a letter (or combination of letters), which is taken from a table (indexed to length and width) or just assigned on an ad-hoc basis: Examples are (each starting with the narrowest width):

A, B, C, D, E, EE, EEE, EEEE, F, G (typical North American system, with the unlettered norm being D for men and B for women)
4A, 3A, 2A, A, B, C, D, E, 2E, 3E, 4E, 5E, 6E (variant North American)
C, D, E, F, G, H (common UK; "medium" is usually F, but varies by manufacturer—makers Edward Green and Crockett & Jones, among others, use E instead, but one maker's E is not necessarily the same size as another's).
N (narrow), M (medium) or R (regular), W (wide)



The width for which these sizes are suitable can vary significantly between manufacturers. The A–E width indicators used by most American, Canadian, and some British shoe manufacturers are typically based on the width of the foot, and common step sizes are ​3⁄16 inch (4.8 mm).
Common sizing systems[edit]
Mondopoint[edit]
The International Standard is ISO 9407:1991, "Shoe sizes—Mondopoint system of sizing and marking",[2] which recommends a shoe-size system known as Mondopoint.
It is based on the mean foot length and width for which the shoe is suitable, measured in millimetres. A shoe size of 280/110 indicates a mean foot length of 280 millimetres (11.0 in) and width of 110 millimetres (4.3 in).
Because Mondopoint also takes the foot width into account, it allows for better fitting than most other systems. It is, therefore, used by NATO and other military services. Mondopoint is also used for ski boots.
United Kingdom and Ireland[edit]
Shoe size in the United Kingdom and Ireland is based on the length of the last used to make the shoes, measured in barleycorn (​1⁄3 inch) starting from the smallest size deemed practical, which is called size zero. It is not formally standardised. Note that the last is typically longer than the foot heel to toe length by about 1⁄2 to 2⁄3 inch (13 to 17 mm).
A child's size zero is equivalent to 4 inches (a hand = 12 barleycorns = 10.16 cm), and the sizes go up to size ​13 1⁄2 (​8 1⁄2 in, ​25 1⁄2 barleycorns or 21.59 cm). Thus, the calculation for a children’s shoe size in the UK is:






child shoe size

=
(
3
×

last length in inches

)
−
12


{\displaystyle {\mbox{child shoe size}}=(3\times {\mbox{last length in inches}})-12}



equivalent to






child shoe size

≈
(
3
×

heel to toe length in inches

)
−
10


{\displaystyle {\mbox{child shoe size}}\approx (3\times {\mbox{heel to toe length in inches}})-10}



An adult size one is then the next size up (​8 2⁄3 in, 26 barleycorns or 22.01 cm) and each size up continues the progression in barleycorns.[3] The calculation for an adult shoe size in the UK is thus:






adult shoe size

=
(
3
×

last length in inches

)
−
25


{\displaystyle {\mbox{adult shoe size}}=(3\times {\mbox{last length in inches}})-25}



equivalent to






adult shoe size

≈
(
3
×

heel to toe length  in inches

)
−
23


{\displaystyle {\mbox{adult shoe size}}\approx (3\times {\mbox{heel to toe length  in inches}})-23}



Note: some manufacturers choose to use a constant other than 25, so sizes do vary in either direction e.g. A shoe marked as a European size 40 may also be marked as a UK: 6 by Jimmy Choo, Nike; a ​6 1⁄2 by Adidas, Clarks, Dr Martens, Fred Perry, Karrimor, Monsoon, New Balance, Reebok, and Slazenger; a 7 by Converse, Gap, Pavers, and Timberland; and a ​7 1⁄2 by Crocs. Some retailers mark a larger size on women's European compatible which can cause confusion with the UK unisex sizes. A size 8 should be a European 42 in both male and female shoes, but this is often marked as a 9 for women.
Australia/New Zealand[edit]
For men and children's footwear the UK system is followed. Women's footwear has a slightly different sizing that is unique. It is in between the UK and US's sizings.[citation needed]
United States and Canada[edit]
In North America, there are different systems that are used concurrently. The size indications are usually similar but not exactly equivalent especially with athletic shoes at extreme sizes. The most common is the customary, described in more detail below, which for men's shoes is one size shorter than the UK equivalent. (so a men's 13 in the US or Canada is the same size as a men's 12 in the UK)
Customary[edit]
The traditional system is similar to English sizes but start counting at one rather than zero, so equivalent sizes are one greater. So the calculation for a male shoe size in the USA or Canada is:






male shoe size

=
3
×

last length in inches

−
24


{\displaystyle {\mbox{male shoe size}}=3\times {\mbox{last length in inches}}-24}



Women's sizes are almost always determined with the "common" scale, in which women's sizes are equal to men's sizes plus 1.5 (for example, a men's 10.5 is a women's 12). In other words:






female shoe size (common)

=
3
×

last length in inches

−
22


1
2




{\displaystyle {\mbox{female shoe size (common)}}=3\times {\mbox{last length in inches}}-22{\frac {1}{2}}}



In the less popular scale, known as the "standard" or "FIA" (Footwear Industries of America) scale, women's sizes are men's sizes plus 1 (so a men's 10.5 is a women's 11.5).






female shoe size (FIA)

=
3
×

last length in inches

−
23


{\displaystyle {\mbox{female shoe size (FIA)}}=3\times {\mbox{last length in inches}}-23}



Children's[edit]
Children's sizes are equal to men's sizes plus ​12 1⁄3. Children’s sizes do not differ by gender even though adults’ do.






Child shoe size

=
3

3




{\displaystyle {\mbox{Child shoe size}}=3\times {\mbox{last length in inches}}-11{\frac {2}{3}}}



Children's shoe stores in the United States and Canada use a sizing scheme which ends at 13, after which the adult range starts at 1:

Alternatively, a scale running from K4 to K13 and then 1 to 7 is in use.[4] K4 to K9 are toddler sizes, K10 to 3 are pre-school and 1 to 7 are grade school sizes.
Brannock Device[edit]




Drawing of a Brannock Device (from U.S. Patent 1,725,334)


A slightly different sizing method is based on the Brannock Device, a measuring instrument invented by Charles F. Brannock in 1925 and now found in many shoe stores. The formula used by the Brannock device assumes a foot length ⅔ inch (1.7 cm) less than the length of the last; thus, men's size 1 is equivalent to a foot's length of 7 ⅔ inches.[5] Women's sizes are one size up.






male shoe size (Brannock)

=
3
×

foot length in inches

−

{\displaystyle {\mbox{male shoe size (Brannock)}}=3\times {\mbox{foot length in inches}}-22}

[6]







female shoe size (Brannock)

=
3
×

foot length in inches

−
21


{\displaystyle {\mbox{female shoe size (Brannock)}}=3\times {\mbox{foot length in inches}}-21}

[6]

The method also measures the length of the distance of the heel and the widest point of the foot. For that purpose, the device has another, shorter scale at the side of the foot. If this scale indicates a larger size, it is taken in place of the foot's length.[7]
For children's sizes, additional wiggle room is added to allow for growth.[7]
The device also measures the width of the foot and assigns it designations of AAA, AA, A, B, C, D, E, EE, or EEE. The widths are 3/16 in apart and differ by shoe length.[5]
Foot Scanner[edit]
Some shoe stores use optical devices to precisely measure the length and width of both feet and recommend the appropriate shoe model and size. [1]
Europe[edit]
The Continental European system is used in Portugal, France, Germany,[8] Italy, Spain,[9] and most other continental European countries. It is also used in Middle Eastern countries (such as Iran), Brazil—which uses the same method but subtracts 2 from the final result—[citation needed] and, commonly, Hong Kong.
In this system, the shoe size is the length of the last, expressed in Paris points, for both sexes and for adults and children alike. Because a Paris point is ⅔ of a centimetre, the formula is as follows:






s
h
o
e
 
s
i
z
e
 
(

P

(

)




{\displaystyle \mathrm {shoe~size~({Paris~points})={\frac {3}{2}}\times {last~length}\left({cm}\right)} }



To compute the size based on actual foot length, one must first add a length of about 1.5 to 2 cm. For instance, for a shoe having an external length 1.5 cm longer than the foot:






s
h
o
e
 
s

+

]





{\displaystyle \mathrm {shoe~size~({Paris~points})={\frac {3}{2}}\times {\left[~foot~length\left({cm}\right)+1.5~\right]}} }



This gives the relationships:
European size = 1.27 × UK size + 31.75
UK size = European size / 1.27 - 25 = 0.7874 × European size - 25
Asia[edit]
The Asian system is based on metric measurements and standardised as JIS S 5037:1998, CNS 4800, S 1093, or KS M 6681. Foot length and girth are taken into account.[10]
The foot length is indicated in centimetres; an increment of 5 mm is used. This system was also used in the GDR.
The length is followed by designators for girth (A, B, C, D, E, EE, EEE, EEEE, F, G), which is taken from a table indexed to girth and length. There are different tables for men's, women's, and children's (less than 12 years of age) shoes. The tables also include the width as supplemental indications. Not all designators are used for all genders and in all countries. For example, the largest girth for women in China is EEEE, whereas in Japan, it is F.
Mexico[edit]
Shoes are sized either according to the foot length they are intended to fit, in cm, or alternatively to another variation of the barleycorn system, with sizes calculated approximately as:






adult shoe size

=
3
×

last length in inches

−
25.5


{\displaystyle {\mbox{adult shoe size}}=3\times {\mbox{last length in inches}}-25.5}



USSR (Russia/CIS)[edit]
Historically the USSR used the European (Paris point) system but an alternative metric system (State Standard 3927–64) was devised, with shoe sizes increasing in ½ rather than the ⅔ cm intervals found in the European scheme. This system has been refined by later standards:

GOST 9133-1978 Determination of linear dimensions of footwear
GOST 24382-1980 sneakers size
GOST R 54592-2011 Footwear. Methods for determination of linear dimensions.

Where used this system is sometimes described as a Pointe (ballet shoe) or Stych size:

Difficulties in shoe size comparison[edit]
Please note that the following tables indicate theoretical sizes calculated from the standards and information given above. Differences between various shoe size tables, makers' tables or other tables found on the Web are usually due to the following factors:

The systems are not fully standardised. Differences between shoes from different makers, which are due to different methods of measuring the shoes, different manufacturing processes, or different allowances[1] are sometimes related to different countries. A "German" size may then differ from a "French" size, although both countries use the Continental European system.
Different widths may have the result that for wide feet, a shoe multiple sizes larger (and actually too long) may be required. This may also result in different size indications, especially if different typical widths are attributed to different sizing systems or countries.
Some tables for children take future growth into account. The shoe size is then larger than what would correspond to the actual length of the foot.[7]
An indication in centimetres or inches can mean the length of the foot or the length of the shoe's inner cavity. This relation is not constant but varies due to different amounts of wiggle room required for different sizes of shoes.
There are several U.S. systems, which differ substantially for sizes far above or below medium sizes.

Further, some tables available on the Web simply contain errors. For example, the wiggle room or different zero point is not taken into account, or tables based on different U.S. systems (traditional and athletic) are simply combined although they are incompatible.
