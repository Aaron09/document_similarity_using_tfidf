Daylight saving time[edit]
Main article: Summer Time in Europe
Daylight saving time in Russia was originally introduced on 30 June [13 July, N.S.] 1917 by a decree of the Russian Provisional Government. However, it was abandoned by a Decree of the Soviet government five months later.
Daylight saving time was re-introduced in the USSR on 1 April 1981, by a decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. Daylight saving time began on 1 April and ended on 1 October each year, until mid-1984, when the USSR began following European daylight saving time rules, moving clocks forward one hour at 02:00 local standard time on the last Sunday in March, and back one hour at 03:00 local daylight time on the last Sunday in September until 1995, after which the change back occurred on the last Sunday in October. The usage of daylight saving time continued after the Soviet collapse but ended in 2011, when Russia stopped observing daylight saving time.
On 27 March 2011, clocks were advanced as usual, but they did not go back on 30 October 2011, effectively making Moscow Time UTC+04:00 permanently.[4] On 26 October 2014, following another change in the law, the clocks in most of the country were moved back one hour, but summer Daylight Time was not reintroduced; Moscow Time returned to UTC+03:00 permanently.[5] Since this reform, most Russian territories have a standard time ahead of mean solar time, including time in some cities ahead it even by one hour. For example, St. Petersburg at 30°E [+2h (*solar time)] has UTC+03:00, Yekaterinburg at 60°E (+4h*) has UTC+05:00, and Vladivostok at 132°E (+9h*) has UTC+10:00.
History[edit]
Russian Empire[edit]
In the Russian Empire, most of the nation observed solar time. During the late 19th century, Moscow Mean Time was introduced on 1 January [13 January, N.S.] 1880, originally at GMT+02:30:17.[6] 2:30:17 corresponds to 37.6166667°, the longitude of Moscow. Other parts of Russia kept solar time for several years. At this time, Russia had the Julian calendar with 12 or 13 days less date compared to Western Europe, so it is possible to say the Moscow actually had GMT-285:29:43 (GMT-11d 21h 29m 43s) (29 February [12 March, N.S.] 1800 − 28 February [12 March, N.S.] 1900), GMT-309:29:43 (GMT-12d 21h 29m 43s) (29 February [13 March, N.S.] 1900 − 3 July [16 July, N.S.] 1916) and GMT-309:28:41 (GMT-12d 21h 28m 41s) (3 July [16 July, N.S.] 1916 − 31 January [13 February, N.S.] 1918). Russia adopted the Gregorian calendar on Thursday, 14 February 1918, which most of Europe already used.

Soviet Union[edit]
After the Soviet Union was created, Moscow Time became UTC+2 and the various other time zones (up to UTC+12) were introduced throughout Russia and the rest of the Soviet Union, for example Irkutsk Time GMT+7 (Irkutsk has since this always been MSK+5).[6] Between 1917-1922 the time was less ordered, with daylight savings time some of those years, some with two hours addition, and some of those years with one or two hours extra winter time.[6]

On 21 June 1930, the Soviet Union advanced all clocks by one hour, effectively making the nation run on daylight saving time all year (the so-called decree time).

On 1 April 1981, daylight saving time (two hours ahead of standard time) was re-introduced; clocks were moved one hour forward on 1 April (the last Sunday of March since 1985) and one hour back on 1 October (the last Sunday of September since 1984, the last Sunday of October since 1996).[6]

On 1 April 1981, 00:00:00, Oymyakonsky District changed its time zone from MSK+6 to MSK+8.[7]
The change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+9 to UTC+12, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+9 to UTC+11.[citation needed]

On 1 April 1982, 00:00:00, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug changed its time zone from MSK+10 to MSK+9, thus eliminating Anadyr Time (MSK+10 or UTC+13 without DST).[8]
The change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+14 to UTC+13, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+13 to UTC+12.

On 27 March 1988, 02:00:00, Saratov and Volgograd oblasts changed its time zone from MSK+1 to MSK.[9][10]
The change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+5 to UTC+4, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+4 to UTC+3.

On 26 March 1989, the following changes were introduced, which, in particular, some oblasts switched to Moscow Time (thus eliminating Samara Time; MSK+1 or UTC+4 without DST):

Astrakhan Oblast
Kirov Oblast
Kuybyshev Krai
Ulyanovsk Oblast

Some oblasts switched from Moscow Time to Eastern European Time:

Kaliningrad Oblast


Russian Federation[edit]
Russia and most republics in the Soviet Union abolished the decree time (not moving the clocks) on 31 March 1991, but Russia reversed this the following year (except Samara Oblast which was already in UTC+04:00).[citation needed]

On 29 September 1991, 03:00:00, Samara Oblast changed its time zone from MSK to MSK+1 (thus reinstating Samara Time; MSK+1). So the zone boundaries on 20 October, Samara Oblast changed its time zone from UTC+3 to UTC+4.[11]

On 23 May 1993, 00:00:00, Novosibirsk Oblast changed its time zone from MSK+4 to MSK+3.[12]
The change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+8 to UTC+7, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+7 to UTC+6.

On 28 May 1995, 00:00:00, Altai Krai and Altai Republic changed its time zone from MSK+4 to MSK+3.[13]

On 30 March 1997, 02:00:00, Sakhalin Oblast changed its time zone from MSK+8 to MSK+7.[14]

On 1 May 2002, 03:00:00, Tomsk Oblast changed its time zone from MSK+4 to MSK+3.[15]





11 time zones in Russia from 2004 to 2010




  UTC+02 Kaliningrad Time
  UTC+03 Moscow Time
  UTC+04 Samara Time
  UTC+05 Yekaterinburg Time
  UTC+06 Omsk Time/ Novosibirsk Time


  UTC+07 Krasnoyarsk Time

On 1 January 2004, 00:00:00, New Siberian Islands, Tomponsky District and Ust-Maysky District changed its time zone from MSK+6 to MSK+7.[16]





April 2010: 9 zones




  UTC+02 Kaliningrad Time
  UTC+03 Moscow Time
  UTC+05 Yekaterinburg Time
  UTC+06 Omsk Time
  UTC+07 Krasnoyarsk Time


  UTC+08 Irkutsk Time
  UTC+09 Yakutsk Time
  UTC+10 Vladivostok Time
  UTC+11 Magadan Time







The following time zone changes occurred on 28 March 2010, which, in particular, led to abolition of two of the eleven time zones.

Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and Kamchatka Krai started using Magadan Time, thus eliminating Kamchatka Time (MSK+9 or UTC+12 without DST).[17]
Kemerovo Oblast started using Omsk Time.[18]
The Udmurt Republic and Samara Oblast started using Moscow Time, thus eliminating Samara Time (MSK+1 or UTC+4 without DST).[19][20]

Although the Russian government wants to reduce the number of time zones even further, there have been protests in far-eastern Russia on the recent changes, including protests and a 20,000-strong petition in support of Kamchatka returning to UTC+12.[21]





September 2011: 9 zones, "permanent DST".




  UTC+03 Kaliningrad Time
  UTC+04 Moscow Time
  UTC+06 Yekaterinburg Time
  UTC+07 Omsk Time


  UTC+08 Krasnoyarsk Time
  UTC+09 Irkutsk Time
  UTC+10 Yakutsk Time
  UTC+11 Vladivostok Time
  UTC+12 Magadan Time







The decree No. 725[22] (31 August 2011) changed UTC offset for Moscow Time and the other time zones. Moscow Time Zone now used UTC+04:00 all year around. The notions of decree time and daylight saving time were abolished in the law, but in fact, this law mandated permanent daylight saving time (or even double daylight saving time in regions that had not abolished the decree time). Some areas changed offset from Moscow:
Some districts of the Sakha Republic switched from Magadan Time (Zone 9) to Vladivostok Time (from Zone 8):

Oymyakonsky District

Some districts of the Sakha Republic switched from Vladivostok Time (Zone 8) to Yakutsk Time (Zone 7):

New Siberian Islands
Tomponsky District
Ust-Maysky District








28 March 2010 (with DST)









13 September 2011 ("permanent DST")




Blue Yakutsk Time (MSK+6), pink Vladivostok Time (MSK+7), red Magadan Time (MSK+8).





October 2014: 11 zones


As a result of the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, local authorities in the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol decreed that clocks in the newly proclaimed Russian federal subjects should jump ahead two hours at 10 p.m. on 29 March 2014 to switch from Eastern European Time (UTC+2) to Moscow Time (UTC+4).[23]
On 22 July 2014, further changes were passed, which took effect on 26 October 2014. All of Russia moved back one hour, so Moscow Time became UTC+3. Some areas changed offset from Moscow:[24]

Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and Kamchatka Krai remained on UTC+12:00 (thus reinstating Kamchatka Time, MSK+9)
Magadan Oblast moved back two hours to UTC+10:00 (went from Magadan Time, MSK+8 to Vladivostok Time, MSK+7)
The parts of the Magadan Time zone that remained on MSK+8, were given a new time zone name, Srednekolymsk Time, UTC+11.
Zabaykalsky Krai moved back two hours to UTC+08:00 (went from Yakutsk to Irkutsk Time)
Kemerovo Oblast remained on UTC+07:00 (went from Omsk to Krasnoyarsk Time)
Udmurtia and Samara Oblast remained on UTC+04:00 (thus reinstating Samara Time, MSK+1)

Annual DST changes is not observed.[25]




Time zones in Russia, difference with standard time:
  -2 h ± 30 min
  -1 h ± 30 min
  ± 30 min
  +1 h ± 30 min
  +2 h ± 30 min




The following time zone changes occurred on 27 March 2016:[26]

Sakhalin Oblast moved forward one hour from UTC+10:00 to UTC+11:00 (from Vladivostok to Srednekolymsk time), except Severo-Kurilsky District, which was already in UTC+11:00 (Srednekolymsk Time)
Zabaykalsky Krai moved forward one hour from UTC+08:00 to UTC+09:00 (from Irkutsk to Yakutsk time)

Astrakhan and Ulyanovsk oblasts moved forward one hour from UTC+03:00 to UTC+04:00 (from Moscow to Samara time)

The following time zone change occurred on 24 April 2016:[27]

Magadan Oblast moved forward one hour from UTC+10:00 to UTC+11:00 (from Vladivostok to Srednekolymsk time)

After these changes, the UTC+11:00 time zone is also named Magadan Time or Sakhalin Time.[28]
The following time zone change occurred on 29 May 2016:[29]

Tomsk Oblast moved forward one hour from UTC+06:00 to UTC+07:00 (from Omsk to Krasnoyarsk time)

The following time zone change occurred on 4 December 2016:[31][32]

Saratov Oblast moved forward one hour from UTC+03:00 to UTC+04:00 (from Moscow to Samara time)

Railway time[edit]
All timetables on Russian Railways (except Sakhalin railways) follow Moscow Time.[33] Airports, however, follow local time.[34]
tz database[edit]




http://efele.net/maps/tz/russia – data from 2009


For Russia, the tz database contains several zones in the file zone.tab.
List of zones[edit]
The list below shows the 16 zones for Russia as defined in the file zone.tab of the database. The database aims to identify regions that had the same time offset rules since 1970.
Two federal subjects are contained in more than one tz zone. The Sakha Republic is divided into three: west, central, east. Sakhalin Oblast is divided into two: Sakhalin Island with Kurilsky and Yuzhno-Kurilsky districts in the Kuril Islands, and Severo-Kurilsky District in the Kuril Islands.
Two zones, namely Asia/Omsk and Asia/Novosibirsk, each cover area that did not observe the same rule set since 1970, all now using Omsk Time.
On the last Sunday in October 2011, daylight-saving time ended in tzdata, but all zones moved forward one hour. In other words, the clocks did not change, but the names of the time zones reverted permanently to their standard time variants and there will be no more daylight-saving time.[citation needed]
If available, the change column lists the offset changes that caused a creation of a new zone in the tz database.
"Initial zone" means that in 1970 there was already a difference in time offset from the offsets in any other zone.

Deleted zones[edit]
Asia/Ulan Ude was a time zone identifier from the zone file of the tz database. The reference point was Ulan-Ude. It was added in tz version 2011e.[37] Edition 2011i did not contain it anymore. The area remained at Asia/Irkutsk. The contained data in zone.tab was:

RU
+5150+10736
Asia/Ulan_Ude
Moscow+05 - Buryatia

The covered area was Republic of Buryatia.
Federal subjects with multiple offsets at the same time[edit]
Per a 2011 law, last amended in 2016,[38] the territory of Sakha Republic observes more than one offset.

Sakha Republic


UTC+9 MSK+6 Asia/Yakutsk: all except districts in other time zones
UTC+10 MSK+7 Asia/Vladivostok: Oymyakonsky, Ust-Yansky, and Verkhoyansky Districts
UTC+11 MSK+8 Asia/Magadan: Abyysky, Allaikhovsky, Momsky, Nizhnekolymsky, Sredrekolymsky, and Verkhnekolymsky Districts
