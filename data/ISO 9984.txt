Georgian national system of romanization[edit]
This system, adopted in February 2002 by the State Department of Geodesy and Cartography of Georgia and the Institute of Linguistics, Georgian National Academy of Sciences, establishes a transliteration system of the Georgian letters into Latin letters.[1] The system was already in use, since 1998, on driving licenses. It is also used by BGN and PCGN since 2009.
Unofficial system of romanization[edit]
Despite its popularity this system sometimes leads to ambiguity. The system is mostly used in social networks, forums, chat rooms, etc. The system is greatly influenced by the common case-sensitive Georgian keyboard layout that ties each key to each letter in the alphabet (seven of them: T, W, R, S, J, Z, C with the help of the shift key to make another letter).
ISO standard[edit]
ISO 9984:1996, "Transliteration of Georgian characters into Latin characters", was last reviewed and confirmed in 2010.[2] The guiding principles in the standard are:

No Digraph (orthography), One latin letter per Georgian letter (apart from apostrophes )
Apostrophe ’ marks aspirated consonants, ejectives are unmarke, e.g.: კ -> k, ქ -> k’
The only extended characters are latin letters with caron (haček) (with the exception of "g macron" ღ -> ḡ)
No capitalization, both as it does not appear in the original script, and to avoid confusion with claimed popular ad-hoc transliterations of Caron characters as capitals instead. (eg. შ as S for š)

Notes[edit]



^ a b c d e Archaic letters.
^ a b c d e f g These are influenced by aforementioned layout, and are preferred to avoid ambiguity, as an expressions: t, j, g, ch can mean two letters.
^ Initially, the use of y letter for ყ is most probably due to their resemblance to each other.
