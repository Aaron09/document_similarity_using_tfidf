The following are approximate tallies of current listings in Wyoming on the National Register of Historic Places. These counts are based on entries in the National Register Information Database as of April 24, 2008[2] and new weekly listings posted since then on the National Register of Historic Places web site.[3] There are frequent additions to the listings and occasional delistings, and the counts here are not official.
