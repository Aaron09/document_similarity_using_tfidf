Communications in Taiwan comprise the following communication media, deployed in the Taiwan Area of the Republic of China and regulated by the National Communications Commission of the Executive Yuan.
Since the mid-1970s there has been an accelerating shift from traditional personal services (small shops and restaurants) to modern personal services (department stores and hotels) and modern commercial services (finance and communications).
Domestic television has long carried many foreign programs, and liberalization of import restrictions in the 1980s brought more.
There are about 30 daily newspapers and thousands of periodicals, many of the latter house organs of various political and non-political organizations. The government sets general guidelines for the political and cultural content of newspapers and periodicals. There are three television stations and about 30 radio broadcasting companies with more than 180 stations.

Broadband internet access[edit]

See for rankings: List of countries by broadband users.

The number of broadband subscribers in Taiwan surpassed 4.5 million by the end of March 2007.[1] This number is approximately 20% of the total population.
Internet censorship[edit]
There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the authorities surveil the e-mail or telecommunication chat rooms without appropriate legal authority.
The constitution and law provide for freedom of speech and press, and the government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to protect freedom of speech and press. Individual groups engage in the peaceful expression on views via the Internet, including via the e-mail.
In accordance to a survey conducted by Taiwan's Institute for Information Industry, an NGO, 81.8% of households had Internet access at the end of 2011.
The websites of mainland institutions such as the Communist Party of China, People's Daily, and China Central Television can be freely accessed from Taiwan.
