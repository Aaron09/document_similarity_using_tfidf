Populated places in Estonia


Populated places in Estonia (officially: settlement units[1]), are cities or settlement units of rural municipalities, but only cities have administrative functions. Settlement units are divided into settlements[2] and urban regions[3] (subdivisions of cities).
Officially there are five types of settlement units in Estonia:

city (est: linn)
cities without municipal status (est: vallasisene linn)
town (est: alev)
small town (est: alevik)
village (est: küla)
