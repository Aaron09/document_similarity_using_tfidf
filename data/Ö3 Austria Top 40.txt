Charts published[edit]
Presently four charts are published:

Ö3 Austria Top 40 Singles – a Top 75 listing
Ö3 Austria Top 40 Longplay (Albums) – a Top 75 listing
Ö3 Austria Top 20 Compilation – including releases as Diverse Interpreten (Various artists)
Ö3 Austria Top 10 DVD

Note that online versions of the chart at charts.orf.at and austriancharts.at still list 75 top positions and are known by various outlets and presentations as Ö3 Austria Top 75, but charts.orf.at still labels itself as "Ö3 Austria Top 40" and broadcast versions only quote the top 40 with the rest of the positions 41 to 75 considered as "bubbling under".
