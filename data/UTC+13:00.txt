Some bases in Antarctica, in particular South Pole and McMurdo Station. These places are the first in the world to see the sun at New Year, since the sun is up at midnight at that time of the year.

History[edit]
The Republic of Kiribati introduced a change for its eastern half on 1 January 1995, from time zones −11 and −10 to +13 and +14, to avoid having the country divided by the International Date Line.
Tonga has been on UTC+13 for many years. Daylight saving time was used in the southern summer seasons from October 1999 to January 2002, and from November 2016 to present (written 2017).[4]
UTC+13 was used as a daylight time (summer in Northern Hemisphere) in the parts of very eastern Russia (Chukotka and Kamchatka) that used Kamchatka Time. Since 2010, daylight saving time has not been used in Russia.
At the end of 29 December 2011 (UTC−10), Samoa advanced its standard time from UTC−11 to UTC+13 (and its daylight saving time from UTC−10 to UTC+14), essentially moving the international date line to the other side of the country.[5][6] Following Samoa’s decision, Tokelau also simultaneously advanced its standard time (used without daylight saving time), from UTC−11 to UTC+13.[7]
