General statistical activities related to the European Statistical system are:

Coordination and governance of the European Statistical System
Statistical methodological coordination and research
Statistical quality and reporting

Geographical scope[edit]
Currently Eurostat data are aggregated at EU-28 level, known as EU-28. While Brexit is planned for 29 march 2019, it is expected that after the Brexit date they will be computed for the EU-27 only as the Brexit will make the UK to be a third country. Nonetheless, to avoid confusion with the previous EU-27 group of 27 member state — which was used in series of statistical data before the accession on the member state number 28 — another name for the future EU 27 — without UK — might be defined after, according to Eurostat[8]. The concept of EU 28 is used from 1st January 2014, also according to Eurostat Methodological manual on city statistics 2017 edition.

Local data are also computed at NUTS level.
Access to Eurostat statistics[edit]
The most important statistics are made available via press releases. They are placed on the Eurostat website at 11:00 in the morning. This is also the time that the press release content may be distributed to the public by press agencies.
Eurostat disseminates its statistics free of charge via its Internet and its statistical databases that are accessible via the Internet. The statistics are hierarchically ordered in a navigation tree. Tables are distinguished from multi-dimensional datasets from which the statistics are extracted via an interactive tool.
In addition various printed publications are available either in electronic form free on the internet or in printed form via the EU Bookshop. Only larger publications are charged for as printed copies.
Since September 2009 Eurostat has pioneered a fully electronical way of publishing, Statistics Explained,[9] like Wikipedia based on Mediawiki open source software and with a largely similar structure and navigation. Statistics Explained is not only a dissemination format, however, but also a wiki working platform for producing flagship publications like the Eurostat Yearbook.[10]
Ireland now has the lowest tax-to-GDP measure across 30 European countries, new figures from Eurostat have shown. The metric is calculated by dividing the tax revenue collected by the Government from the gross domestic product (GDP).
Statistical data for research purposes[edit]
Microdata, which in principle allows the identification of the statistical unit (e.g. a person in the labour force survey or a company for innovation statistics), is treated as strictly confidential. Under tight security procedures various anonymised datasets are provided to research institutions for validated research projects.
