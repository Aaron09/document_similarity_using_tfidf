Lambda, Œõ, Œª (uppercase Œõ, lowercase Œª; Greek: ŒªŒ¨Œº(Œ≤)Œ¥Œ± l√°m(b)da) is the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals lambda has a value of 30. Lambda is related to the Phoenician letter Lamed . Letters in other alphabets that stemmed from lambda include the Latin L and the Cyrillic letter El (–õ, –ª). The ancient grammarians and dramatists give evidence to the pronunciation as [laÀêbdaÀê] (ŒªŒ¨Œ≤Œ¥Œ±) in Classical Greek times.[1] In Modern Greek the name of the letter, ŒõŒ¨ŒºŒ¥Œ±, is pronounced [lam√∞a]; the spoken letter itself has the sound of "l" as with Latinate "L".
In early Greek alphabets, the shape and orientation of lambda varied.[2] Most variants consisted of two straight strokes, one longer than the other, connected at their ends. The angle might be in the upper-left, lower-left ("Western" alphabets), or top ("Eastern" alphabets). Other variants had a vertical line with a horizontal or sloped stroke running to the right. With the general adoption of the Ionic alphabet, Greek settled on an angle at the top; the Romans put the angle at the lower-left.
The HTML 4 character entity references for the Greek capital and small letter lambda are "&#923;" and "&#955;", respectively.[3] The Unicode code points for lambda are U+039B and U+03BB.

Lower-case lambda


Examples of the symbolic use of lowercase lambda include:

In evolutionary algorithms, Œª indicates the number of offspring that would be generated from Œº current population in each generation. The terms Œº and Œª are originated from Evolution strategy notation.
Lambda indicates the wavelength of any wave, especially in physics, electronics engineering, and mathematics.[4]
Lambda indicates the radioactivity decay constant in nuclear physics and radioactivity. This constant is very simply related (by a multiplicative constant) to the half-life of any radioactive material.
In probability theory, lambda represents the density of occurrences within a time interval, as modeled by the Poisson distribution.
In mathematical logic and computer science, lambda is used to introduce anonymous functions expressed with the concepts of lambda calculus.
Lambda is a unit of volume, synonymous with one microliter (1 ŒºL), that is, one cubic millimetre (1¬†mm3). This use is currently deprecated.
Lambda indicates an eigenvalue in the mathematics of linear algebra.
In the physics of electric fields, lambda sometimes indicates the linear charge density of a uniform line of electric charge (measured in coulombs per meter).
Lambda denotes a Lagrange multiplier in multi-dimensional calculus.
In solid-state electronics, lambda indicates the channel length modulation parameter of a MOSFET.
There is a lambda phage virus in biology.
In ecology, lambda denotes the long-term intrinsic growth rate of a population. This value is often calculated as the dominant eigenvalue of the age/size class matrix (mathematics).
In formal language theory and in computer science, lambda denotes the empty string.
Lambda is a nonstandard symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet.
In telecommunications, lambda indicates the wavelength in a wavelength-division multiplexing optical communications system. This is actually a form of the long-established concept of frequency-division multiplexing.
Lambda denotes the Lebesgue measure in mathematical set theory.
The Goodman and Kruskal's lambda in statistics indicates the proportional reduction in error when one variable's values are used to predict the values of another variable.
Lambda denotes the oxygen sensor in a vehicle that measures the air-to-fuel ratio in the exhaust gases of an internal-combustion engine.
A Lambda 4S solid-fuel rocket was used to launch Japan's first orbital satellite in 1970.[5]
Lambda denotes the failure rate of devices and systems in reliability theory, and it is measured in failure events per hour. Numerically, this lambda is also the reciprocal of the mean time between failures.
In criminology, lambda denotes an individual's frequency of offenses.
In cartography and navigation, lambda denotes the longitude of a location.
Lambda denotes Christopher Langton's parameter for the classification of Stephen Wolfram's classes of cellular automata.
In electrochemistry, lambda also denotes the ionic conductance of a given ion (The composition of the ion is generally shown as a subscript to the lambda character).
In neurobiology, lambda denotes the length constant (or exponential rate of decay) of the electric potential across the cell membrane along a length of a nerve cell's axon.
In the science and technology of heat transfer, lambda denotes the heat of vaporization per mole of material (a.k.a. its "latent heat").[6]
In the technology and science of celestial navigation, lambda denotes the longitude as opposed to the Roman letter "L", which denotes the latitude.
King Louis XIII of France used the letter lambda as his personal symbol rather than a monogram.
In Volvo automobiles, lambda denotes an engine, fuel, or ignition system failure.
A block style Lambda is used as a recurring symbol in the Valve Corporation computer game series Half-Life,[7] referring to the Lambda complex of the fictional Black Mesa Research Facility, as well as making appearances in the sequel Half-Life 2.[8]
Lambda was used by Pythagoras to denote the "Lambda number sequence" 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27... (sequence A098293 in the OEIS) formed by the integers of the form 2i and 3i, for nonnegative integer i.[citation needed]

Litra symbol[edit]
The Roman libra and Byzantine l√≠tra (ŒªŒØœÑœÅŒ±), which served as both the pound mass unit and liter volume unit, were abbreviated in Greek using lambda with modified forms of the iota subscript (as ŒªÕÖ). These are variously encoded in Unicode. The Ancient Greek Numbers Unicode block includes 10183 GREEK LITRA SIGN (êÜÉ) as well as êÖ¢, which is described as 10162 GREEK ACROPHONIC HERMIONIAN TEN[9] but was much more common as a form of the litra sign. A variant of the sign can be formed from 0338 COMBINING LONG SOLIDUS OVERLAY and either 039B GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMDA (ŒõÃ∏) or 03BB GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMDA (ŒªÃ∏).[10]
