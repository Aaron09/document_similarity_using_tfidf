Iran Standard Time (IRST) or Iran Time (IT) is the time zone used in Iran. Iran uses a UTC offset UTC+03:30. IRST is defined by the 52.5 degrees east meridian, the same meridian which defines the Iranian calendar and is the official meridian of Iran.
Between 2005 and 2008, by decree of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran did not observe daylight saving time (called Iran Daylight Time or IRDT).[1][2] It was reintroduced from 21 March 2008.

Daylight Saving Transitions Dates[edit]
Iran is unusual in that the dates of DST transitions aren't based on a rule such as the third Monday in September.
So in most countries, DST transitions occur on the same weekday every year, but not in Iran.[3]
