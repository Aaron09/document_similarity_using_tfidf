History[edit]
The Japan Times was launched by Motosada Zumoto on March 22, 1897, with the goal of giving Japanese an opportunity to read and discuss news and current events in English to help Japan to participate in the international community.[5] The paper was independent of government control, but from 1931 onward, the Japanese government was mounting pressure on the paper's editors to submit to its policies. In 1933, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs managed to appoint Hitoshi Ashida, former Ministry official, as chief editor.[6] During World War II, the newspaper served as an outlet for Imperial Japanese government propaganda and editorial opinion. The paper's circulation at that time was about 825,000.[5] It was successively renamed The Japan Times and Mail (1918–1940) following its merger with The Japan Mail, The Japan Times and Advertiser (1940–1943) following its merger with The Japan Advertiser, and Nippon Times (1943–1956) before reverting to the Japan Times title in 1956.[citation needed] The temporary change to Nippon Times occurred during ban of English language sentiment during World War II era Japan.[7] Shintaro Fukushima (1907年- 1987) became the president in 1956. He exchanged each company's stock with Toshiaki Ogasawara (小笠原 敏晶 Ogasawara Toshiaki). Fukushima renounced managing rights in 1983.[8] Thus Ogasawara's Nifco, a manufacturer of automotive fasteners, acquired control of The Japan Times in 1983 and changed all of former staffs and company's tradition established in 1897.[8] Nifco chairman Toshiaki Ogasawara also served as the chairman and publisher of The Japan Times until his death on November 30, 2016.[9] His daughter Yukiko Ogasawara (小笠原 有輝子 Ogasawara Yukiko) was president of the company from 2006 to 2012, when she was replaced by career Japan Times staffer Takeharu Tsutsumi. Yukiko succeeded her father as chairman of the company after his death.[10]
