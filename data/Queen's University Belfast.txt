History[edit]

Queen Victoria and Charles Lanyon


Queen's University Belfast has its roots in the Belfast Academical Institution, which was founded in 1810, one of the United Kingdom's 10 oldest universities, and remains as the Royal Belfast Academical Institution.[5] The present university was first chartered as "Queen's College, Belfast" in 1845, when it was associated with the simultaneously founded Queen's College, Cork, and Queen's College, Galway, as part of the Queen's University of Ireland – founded to encourage higher education for Catholics and Presbyterians, as a counterpart to Trinity College, Dublin, then an Anglican institution.[5] Queen's College, Belfast, opened in 1849.[5] Its main building, the Lanyon Building, was designed by the English architect, Sir Charles Lanyon. At its opening, it had 23 professors and 343 students.[citation needed]. Some early students at Queen's University Belfast took University of London examinations.[7]

The Irish Universities Act, 1908 dissolved the Royal University of Ireland, which had replaced the Queen's University of Ireland in 1879, and created two separate universities: the current National University of Ireland and Queen's University of Belfast.[5]
Parliamentary representation[edit]
Main articles: Queen's University of Belfast (UK Parliament constituency) and Queen's University of Belfast (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)
The university was one of only eight United Kingdom universities to hold a parliamentary seat in the House of Commons at Westminster until such representation was abolished in 1950. The university was also represented in the Parliament of Northern Ireland from 1920–1968, where its graduates elected four seats.
Modern day[edit]
On 20 June 2006, the university announced a £259 million investment programme focusing on facilities, recruitment and research.[8] One of the outcomes of this investment has been a new university library; the McClay library was designed by Boston-based architects Sheply, Bulfinch, Richardson & Abbott, working in association with Belfast architects, Robinson Patterson Partnership, and opened in July 2009. The building has been named in honour of Sir Allen McClay, a major benefactor of Queen's University and of the Library.[9]
In June 2010, the university announced the launch of a £7.5m Ansin international research hub with Seagate Technologies.[10]
The only Juris Doctor degree currently awarded by a UK university is at Queens University Belfast, perhaps in part due to Northern Ireland's peculiarity. This is a 3–4 year degree specified as being a professional doctorate at the doctoral qualifications level in the UK framework, sitting above the LLM and including a 30,000 word dissertation demonstrating "The creation and interpretation of new knowledge, through original research or other advanced scholarship, of a quality to satisfy peer review, extend the forefront of the discipline, and merit publication" that must be passed in order to gain the degree.[11][12]
Queen's is one of the largest employers in Northern Ireland, with a total workforce of 3,903, of whom 2,414 were members of academic, academic-related and research staff and 1,489 were administrative employees.[2]
Campus[edit]

In addition to the main campus not far from the centre of Belfast, the university has two associated university colleges, these being St Mary's and Stranmillis both also located in Belfast. They offer both teacher training for those who wish to pursue teaching careers and a range of degree courses, all of which are centred around a liberal arts core. The university has formal agreements with other colleges in Northern Ireland and operates several outreach schemes to rural areas.
While the university refers to its main site as a campus,[13] the university's buildings are in fact spread over a number of public streets in South Belfast, centring on University Road, University Square and Stranmillis Road, with other departments located further afield.

Queen's University Belfast was admitted to the Russell Group of UK research-intensive universities in November 2006.[30][31] Queen’s University was placed joint 8th in the UK for research intensity following the Research Excellence Framework 2014 (REF). The UK-wide research assessment of higher education institutions placed Queen’s in the top 20 for research quality and impact. It also confirmed that over 75% of the institutions research is world-class or internationally leading with over 95% of Queen’s academic staff returned for assessment, the University has 14 subject areas ranked within the UK’s top 20 with six of these in the top 10, and two in the top five.[32]
Rankings and reputation[edit]
The Times Higher Education rankings 2015/16 placed Queen’s 200th in world and in 2014 reported it in the top 25 most international universities.[33] In the 2016 QS World University Rankings Queen's was ranked 182nd.
In the National Student Survey 2013, Queen's was ranked 12th in the UK for student satisfaction.[34]
Queen's is ranked in the top 200 universities in the world according to the 2015-16 QS World University Rankings. They also commended Queen's for its leadership role in society and its life-changing research. The University is a global player in areas from cancer studies to sustainability, wireless technology to creative writing and from pharmaceuticals to sonic arts.[35] In the same year the university ranked 36th in the UK (The Complete University Guide 2016).[36]
The university has also been awarded by the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Further and Higher Education on several occasions, including for their work in comprehensive cancer services improving survival rates for patients in Northern Ireland.

Entrants to Queen's have, on average, 359 A/AS-level points and there are currently 5.3 applications per place.[41] The Sunday Times has described the Queen's admissions policy as "among the most socially inclusive in Britain and Northern Ireland".[41] 99.5% of first degree entrants are from state schools,[42] although this is mainly due to the lack of private schools in Northern Ireland. The university gives offers of admission to 86.1% of its applicants, the 3rd highest amongst the Russell Group.[43]
In the 2015/16 academic year, the total student population was 23,870, of whom 18,960 were undergraduates and 4,910 postgraduates.[3] Of the overall student population in 2014/15, 22,203 were from the EU, with the remaining 1,650 non-EU students. There was also a total student population of 2,250 at the University's St Mary's and Stranmillis University Colleges as of 2013/2014.[4]
Queen's was established as a non-sectarian institution, with the aim of attracting both Protestant and Catholic students. While the university does not publish data on the religion affiliation of its students, Rupert Taylor, who conducted his PhD research on the university during The Troubles, argued in an article published in 1988 that "Whilst in the past, especially before the Second World War, Catholics were under-represented this is not currently the case". Taylor cites data showing that Catholic representation amongst undergraduates rose from 21.9 per cent in 1958/59 to 27.4 per cent in 1968/69 and 42.5 per cent in 1978/79.[44] By the late 1990s, 54 per cent of Queen's students were Catholics, compared to a 48 per cent share of the Northern Ireland population aged 18–25.[45] The growing share of Catholics in the student population is in part due to the tendency of middle-class Protestants to go to university in Great Britain rather than Northern Ireland.[44]
In 2009, Queen's signed a joint venture partnership with INTO University Partnerships, creating INTO Queen's University Belfast. The INTO centre is based on campus and provides a foundation year for international students who want to study at the University.[46]
Student life[edit]
Students' Union[edit]
Main article: Queen's University Belfast Students' Union




The Students' Union building


The Students' Union at Queen's (QUBSU) is located opposite the Lanyon Building on University Road, and is provided for under the University's Statutes. All students at the University are automatic members of the Union, making it one of the largest Unions on a single campus in Ireland and the UK. It is administered by the Students' Representative Council (SRC) (elected every October, on a Faculty basis) and an Executive (elected in March), who manage the operations of the Union in conjunction with several full-time staff.
Union services[edit]
A range of services are provided by the Students' Union following its reopening in March 2007 after a £9 million redevelopment, including an Advice Centre with full-time staff to help with issues such as money problems, accommodation and welfare. Commercial services are also provided for by the Union and include a shop, canteen and coffee franchise. There are also four bars within the building, the biggest of which, the Mandela Hall, hosts numerous concerts each year as well as the majority the Students' Union's club nights.




Ashby building, Stranmillis


Clubs and societies[edit]
More than fifty sporting clubs and over 100 non-sporting societies are recognised by the Student's Union Council and therefore eligible to apply for an annual grant from the University.[47] The oldest society in Queen's University is the Literary and Scientific Society which focuses on debating political, cultural and social issues within Northern Ireland. Established in 1850 by Edwin Lawrence Godkin, the society has been very successful and produced some of the finest orators within Northern Ireland. The Dragonslayers Gaming Society hosts one of Ireland's largest games conventions, Q-Con, in June of each year, and cultural groups such as An Cumann Gaelach and the Ulster-Scots Society are also present.
The Queen's University Mountaineering Club is notable for producing three Everest summiteers including Ireland's first, Dawson Stelfox.[48] Roger McMorrow and Nigel Hart also summited in May 2007, and were subsequently jointly announced Queen's University Graduates of the year for 2006/07[49] for their role in rescuing a young Nepalese climber left for dead near the summit.[50]
QUB is one of only 20 Universities in the United Kingdom to have the privilege of an AIESEC Local Chapter, developing leadership, business and soft skills in highly motivated students, as well as providing international opportunities through their work abroad program.
Housing[edit]
Queen's provides housing for both undergraduates and postgraduates, although because of the compact size of Northern Ireland many students chose to live at home and commute to the university. In 2005/06, 36% of Queen's students lived in private accommodation within Belfast, 29% lived with parents or guardians, 20% in private accommodation outside of Belfast, and 10% lived in university maintained accommodation.[51] The university provides accommodation on a purpose-built 'student village' called Elms Village, which has its own bar and shop, located on the Malone Road, south of the main campus, as well as in a number of houses in the South Belfast area, including at College Gardens and on Mount Charles.[52]
Cultural life[edit]
The university had hosted the annual Belfast Festival at Queen's since 1961 but it was announced in March 2015 that Queen's would not continue with the festival.[53] In 2007 the university held the Irish Student Drama Association Festival. It runs the Queen's Film Theatre, which has been described as Northern Ireland's leading independent cinema,[54] the Brian Friel Theatre and an art gallery, the Naughton Gallery at Queen's, which is a registered museum.[55] In 2008 the Naughton Gallery was awarded the Times Higher Award for Excellence and Innovation in the Arts.[56] Housed in the Lanyon building since 2001 is a marble statue by Pio Fedi of the great physicist Galileo, portrayed deep in thought.[57]
Sport[edit]




Queen's Physical Education Centre






The first QUB side to win the Sigerson Cup (1958)


Queen's Physical Education Centre (abbreviated to and known widely as the PEC) recently went through an extension program was awarded 'Best Building 2007' by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Northern Ireland.[58] It is one of the largest sports centres in the British Isles. This building houses many squash courts, several climbing walls and is home to QUB's senior men's and women's basketball teams.
The University Playing Fields, also known as Malone Playing Fields, is located just over 2 miles (3.2 km) from the main campus, comprising 17 pitches for rugby, association football, Gaelic football, hockey, hurling, camogie and cricket. In addition, there are three netball courts, nine tennis courts and an athletics arena where the Mary Peters Track is situated. The area and its surrounding forest of Barnetts Demesne are mapped for orienteering.
The university's association football team, Queen's University Belfast A.F.C., play in the Irish Second Division. Queen's snooker team have won the British intervarsity title on a record nine occasions and are the current champions.[59]
Queen's University Belfast Boat Club is one of the most successful clubs in the University. The QUB boathouse, home of Queen's University Belfast Boat Club (QUBBC) and Queen's University of Belfast Ladies Boat Club (QUBLBC), is located on the River Lagan near Stranmillis. In 2010 they were reigning Irish Champions in men's Intermediate and Senior 8's. They are also reigning Irish University Champions in Men's Senior 8's, Women's Novice 8's and Women's Novice 4's.[60] They are the only rowing club in Ireland to have a full-time rowing coach.[61]
Visual identity[edit]
The graphic identity, which includes the logotype, was originally created in 2000 by Lloyd Northover, the British design consultancy founded by John Lloyd (graphic designer) and Jim Northover. This identity was updated in 2011 by Belfast-based brand consultancy, Mammoth.[citation needed] Queen's visual identity was redesigned again in October 2017, also by Mammoth[62], replacing the 'Q' identity with an updated version of the university's crest.
