This is a list of airlines. Lists of airlines are listed alphabetically by the name of the continent from which they operate. There are lists of airlines for all of the continents except for Antarctica, as no airlines are based there. There is only one list of airlines arranged by owner and it lists airlines that are owned by the government of a country. There are over 5000 airlines with ICAO codes. The world's largest airline by fleet size and passengers carried is American Airlines, operating from the United States.[1]
