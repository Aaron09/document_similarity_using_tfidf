Fixed line[edit]
Fixed telephony penetration rate is among the lowest in Europe with 4.48 lines per 100 inhabitants.[1]
Mobile phones[edit]
In 2010, 74 percent of the population was subscribed to mobile phone services, or a total number of 1,537,164[2] In 2007, PTK reported growth of subscribers from 300,000 to 800,000 in less than a year.[3] In 2006, the number was 562,000.[4]
There need for showing your ID to get a Sim card and they can be bought prepaid for 5 Euros with credit.[citation needed] There are a large number of shops for buying used mobile phones, they are sold on the street.[citation needed] Also SIM unlocking shops are numerous.[citation needed] You can buy credit for your mobile phone for the nominal price of 5 Euros, but the handlers charge more for the credit, from 1 Euro more.[citation needed]
There are two GSM 900 MHz networks:[5]

Telekom Srbija

GSM-services in Kosovo are provided currently by Vala, a subsidiary of PTK, and IPKO, a company owned by Telekom Slovenije, which has acquired the second mobile operator license in Kosovo and has started operations in late 2007. Vala has over 850,000 subscribers, mostly using the pre-paid system, whereas IPKO has gained over 300,000 subscribers within just a few months.[9]
