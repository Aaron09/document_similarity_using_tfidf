In aviation, V-speeds are standard terms used to define airspeeds important or useful to the operation of all aircraft.[1] These speeds are derived from data obtained by aircraft designers and manufacturers during flight testing and verified in most countries by government flight inspectors during aircraft type-certification testing. Using them is considered a best practice to maximize aviation safety, aircraft performance or both.[2]
The actual speeds represented by these designators are specific to a particular model of aircraft. They are expressed by the aircraft's indicated airspeed (and not by, for example, the ground speed), so that pilots may use them directly, without having to apply correction factors, as aircraft instruments also show indicated airspeed.
In general aviation aircraft, the most commonly used and most safety-critical airspeeds are displayed as color-coded arcs and lines located on the face of an aircraft's airspeed indicator. The lower ends of the green arc and the white arc are the stalling speed with wing flaps retracted, and stalling speed with wing flaps fully extended, respectively. These are the stalling speeds for the aircraft at its maximum weight.[3][4] The yellow range is the range in which the aircraft may be operated in smooth air, and then only with caution to avoid abrupt control movement, and the red line is the VNE, the never exceed speed.
Proper display of V speeds is an airworthiness requirement for type-certificated aircraft in most countries.[5][6]

Regulations[edit]
The most common V-speeds are often defined by a particular government's aviation regulations. In the United States, these are defined in title 14 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations, known as the Federal Aviation Regulations or FARs.[7] In Canada, the regulatory body, Transport Canada, defines 26 commonly used V-speeds in their Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).[8] V-speed definitions in FAR 23, 25 and equivalent are for designing and certification of airplanes, not for their operational use. The descriptions below are for use by pilots.
Regulatory V-speeds[edit]
These V-speeds are defined by regulations. They are typically defined with constraints such as weight, configuration, or phases of flight, some of these constraints have been omitted to simplify the description.


V-speed designator
Description


V1
The speed beyond which the takeoff should no longer be aborted. (See V1 definitions below)[7][8][9]


V2
Takeoff safety speed. The speed at which the aircraft may safely be climbed with one engine inoperative.[7][8][9]


V2min
Minimum takeoff safety speed.[7][8][9]


V3
Flap retraction speed.[8][9]


V4
Steady initial climb speed. The all engines operating take-off climb speed used to the point where acceleration to flap retraction speed is initiated. Should be attained by a gross height of 400 ft (120 m).[10]


VA
Design maneuvering speed. This is the speed above which it is unwise to make full application of any single flight control (or "pull to the stops") as it may generate a force greater than the aircraft's structural limitations.[7][8][9][11]


Vat
Indicated airspeed at threshold, which is usually equal to the stall speed VS0 multiplied by 1.3 or stall speed VS1g multiplied by 1.23 in the landing configuration at the maximum certificated landing mass, though some manufacturers apply different criteria. If both VS0 and VS1g are available, the higher resulting Vat shall be applied.[12] Also called "approach speed".


VB
Design speed for maximum gust intensity.[7][8][9]


VC
Design cruise speed, used to show compliance with gust intensity loading.[13]


Vcef
See V1; generally used in documentation of military aircraft performance. Denotes "critical engine failure" speed as the speed during takeoff where the same distance would be required to either continue the takeoff or abort to a stop.[14]


VD
Design diving speed, the highest speed planned to be achieved in testing.[7][8][9]


VDF
Demonstrated flight diving speed, the highest actual speed achieved in testing.[7][8][9]


VEF
The speed at which the critical engine is assumed to fail during takeoff.[7]


VF
Designed flap speed.[7][8][9]


VFC
Maximum speed for stability characteristics.[7][9]


VFE
Maximum flap extended speed.[7][8][9]


VFTO
Final takeoff speed.[7]


VH
Maximum speed in level flight at maximum continuous power.[7][8][9]


VLE
Maximum landing gear extended speed. This is the maximum speed at which a retractable gear aircraft should be flown with the landing gear extended.[7][8][9][15]


VLO
Maximum landing gear operating speed. This is the maximum speed at which the landing gear on a retractable gear aircraft should be extended or retracted.[7][9][15]


VLOF
Lift-off speed.[7][9]


VMC
Minimum control speed. The minimum speed that the aircraft is still controllable with the critical engine inoperative.[7] Like the stall speed there are several important variables that are used in this determination, refer to the minimum control speed article for a thorough explanation. VMC is sometimes further refined into more discrete V-speeds e.g. VMCA,VMCG.


VMCA
Minimum control speed air. The minimum speed that the aircraft is still controllable with the critical engine inoperative[16] while the aircraft is airborne. VMCA is sometimes simply referred to as VMC.


VMCG
Minimum control speed ground. The minimum speed that the aircraft is still controllable with the critical engine inoperative[16] while the aircraft is on the ground.


VMCL
Minimum control speed in the landing configuration with one engine inoperative.[9][16]


VMO
Maximum operating limit speed.[7][8][9] Exceeding VMO may trigger an overspeed alarm.[17]


VMU
Minimum unstick speed.[7][8][9]


VNE
Never exceed speed.[7][8][9][18]


VNO
Maximum structural cruising speed or maximum speed for normal operations.[7][8][9]


VO
Maximum operating maneuvering speed.[19]


VR
Rotation speed. The speed at which the pilot begins to apply control inputs to cause the aircraft nose to pitch up, after which it will leave the ground.


Vrot
Used instead of VR (in discussions of the takeoff performance of military aircraft) to denote rotation speed in conjunction with the term Vref (refusal speed).[14]


VRef
Landing reference speed or threshold crossing speed.[7][8][9]
(In discussions of the takeoff performance of military aircraft, the term Vref stands for refusal speed. Refusal speed is the maximum speed during takeoff from which the air vehicle can stop within the available remaining runway length for a specified altitude, weight, and configuration.[14]) Incorrectly, or as an abbreviation, some documentation refers to Vref and/or Vrot speeds as "Vr."[20]



VS
Stall speed or minimum steady flight speed for which the aircraft is still controllable.[7][8][9]


VS0
Stall speed or minimum flight speed in landing configuration.[7][8][9]


VS1
Stall speed or minimum steady flight speed for which the aircraft is still controllable in a specific configuration.[7][8]


VSR
Reference stall speed.[7]


VSR0
Reference stall speed in landing configuration.[7]


VSR1
Reference stall speed in a specific configuration.[7]


VSW
Speed at which the stall warning will occur.[7]


VTOSS
Category A rotorcraft takeoff safety speed.[7][18]


VX
Speed that will allow for best angle of climb.[7][8]


VY
Speed that will allow for the best rate of climb.[7][8]

Mach numbers[edit]
Whenever a limiting speed is expressed by a Mach number, it is expressed relative to the speed of sound, e.g. VMO: Maximum operating speed, MMO: Maximum operating Mach number.[7][8]
V1 definitions[edit]
V1 is the critical engine failure recognition speed or takeoff decision speed. It is the speed above which the takeoff will continue even if an engine fails or another problem occurs, such as a blown tire.[9] The speed will vary among aircraft types and varies according to factors such as aircraft weight, runway length, wing flap setting, engine thrust used and runway surface contamination, thus it must be determined by the pilot before takeoff. Aborting a takeoff after V1 is strongly discouraged because the aircraft will by definition not be able to stop before the end of the runway, thus suffering a "runway overrun".[34]
V1 is defined differently in different jurisdictions:

The US Federal Aviation Administration defines it as: "the maximum speed in the takeoff at which the pilot must take the first action (e.g., apply brakes, reduce thrust, deploy speed brakes) to stop the airplane within the accelerate-stop distance. V1 also means the minimum speed in the takeoff, following a failure of the critical engine at VEF, at which the pilot can continue the takeoff and achieve the required height above the takeoff surface within the takeoff distance."[7]
Transport Canada defines it as: "Critical engine failure recognition speed" and adds: "This definition is not restrictive. An operator may adopt any other definition outlined in the aircraft flight manual (AFM) of TC type-approved aircraft as long as such definition does not compromise operational safety of the aircraft."[8]
