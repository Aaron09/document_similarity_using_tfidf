TechCrunch Disrupt[edit]
The first TechCrunch Disrupt was in 2011. It is an annual tech conference hosted by TechCrunch in San Francisco,[4] New York City,[5] and Europe (London or Berlin).[6]
TechCrunch Disrupt hosts an event called Startup Battlefield at its conferences where startups sign up to pitch their business ideas on a stage in front of venture capital investors, media and other interested parties for prize money and publicity. Past participants include Dropbox,[7] Beam,[8] Vurb,[9] Trello,[10] Mint,[11] Yammer,[12] and Crate.io.[13]
Crunchbase[edit]
From 2007 to 2015, TechCrunch operated Crunchbase, a database of the startup ecosystem, consisting of investors, incubators, start-ups, key people, funds, funding rounds and events.[citation needed] The company claims to have more than 50,000 active contributors on its platform.[14] Subject to registration, members of the public can make submissions to the database; however, all changes are subject to review by a moderator before being accepted.
In 2013, Crunchbase claimed to have 2 million users accessing its database each month.[15]
AOL is in dispute with start-up Pro Populi over that group's use of the entire Crunchbase dataset in apps that Pro Populi has developed, one of which is known as People+. Pro Populi is being represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.[16]
In 2015, Crunchbase spun out of AOL/Verizon/TechCrunch to become a private entity, and is no longer a part of TechCrunch.[17]
Crunchies[edit]
In 2008, TechCrunch started The Crunchies award ceremony, which celebrates the "most compelling startups, internet and technology innovations of the year".[18] Techcrunch often creates a list of the top startups and the funding they received. Twelve categories have been awarded in 2016, including "Best New Startup", "Best Overall Startup", and "Best Mobile App".[19] 2016 was also the first year awarding the Diversity Award.[20]
Public persona[edit]
TechCrunch has more than 9.86 million followers on Twitter,[21] and more than 2.8 million likes on Facebook as of December 2017.[22]
In 2014, TechCrunch Disrupt was featured in an arc of the HBO series Silicon Valley.[23] The characters' startup "Pied Piper" participates on a startup battle at TechCrunch Disrupt.[23]
Controversy[edit]
A scandal erupted over the Titstare application, created by participants in a hackathon at Disrupt 2013.[24][25][26]
In 2011, the site came under fire for possible ethics violations. These included claims that Arrington's investments in certain firms which the site had covered created a conflict of interest.[27] The controversy that ensued eventually led to Arrington's departure, and other writers, including Paul Carr and Sarah Lacy, followed suit.[28][29]
Available languages[edit]
TechCrunch is currently available in English, Chinese[30] and Japanese.[31] It had a French edition, which was folded into[clarification needed] TechCrunch.com.[32]
