Internet censorship and surveillance[edit]
There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet. The Bolivian constitution and law provide for freedom of speech and press. Although the government generally respects these rights, in at least two cases in 2012, the government used the anti-racism law to restrict both rights.[8] Some senior government officials also verbally harassed members of the press corps. Bolivian law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence and the government generally respects these prohibitions, but there have been allegations that the government does not always respect the law. Defamation remains a criminal offence.

Concerns were raised over a 2010 anti-discrimination law. Its "far-reaching and vague" language could be used to curb and punish legitimate journalism, warned the Committee to Protect Journalists.[2]
On 21 October 2012, Vice President Garcia Linera stated that the government records the names of people who insult President Morales on social media sites.[8]
On 23 October 2012, the Constitutional Court struck down the libel law that allowed for detention of one month to four years for a person found guilty of insulting, defaming, or slandering public officials.[8]
On 2016, after the Constitutional Referendum, the government considered the win of the option of NO a "dirty game" but it avoid endangering his government decided to cancel a bill to restrict social networks when insulting President Evo Morales and his acts of corruption (like the Gabriela Zapata's case). But a law is going to be launched in April or May 2016.
