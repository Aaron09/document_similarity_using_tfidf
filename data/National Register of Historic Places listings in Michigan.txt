In 1908, John T. Jones built this experimental blast furnace, named the "Ardis Furnace" after his daughter, to test an iron extraction process he developed. The furnace as originally built was a huge rotating metal tube installed at a slight incline and held in place by a series of concrete supports. The Ardis Furnace was initially a success, but a fundamental heat problem limited its durability, and within two years Jones lost his personal fortune and the project was abandoned. Some elements of Jones's technology were incorporated into later successful operations, but the ruins of the concrete supports are the only remnants of the Ardis furnace.

The Chapin Mine Steam Pump Engine, also known as The Cornish Pump, was built by the E. P.

It was use in the 1890s at the Chapin Mine "D" shaft, and from 1907 to 1914 at the nearby Ludington Mine "C" shaft. At the "C" shaft, the engine was connected to a series of eight pumps, the deepest of which was 1,500 feet (460 m) below ground. The total capacity of the pump system was 3,400 US gallons (13,000 l) per minute. The system was replaced in 1914 by electric pumps, and the Cornish Pump has served as a tourist attraction since 1934.

The oral tradition of the Odawa people holds that the Not-A-Pe-Ka-Gon Site, along the Pere Marquette River, was the site of an important 17th century battle between the Odawa and Mascouten peoples. Many men from both sides of the conflict died in the battle, and their skulls were placed on sticks along the riverbank; the site became known as "Notipekago" or "Notipekagon" - literally, "heads on sticks."

The Little Sable Point Light was constructed in 1874 from a design by Col. Orlando M. Poe. The light sits atop a brick tower with a stone base. Prior to 1900, the brick was left in its natural color and state, as it was unusually hard and held up well to the elements. In 1900 the light was painted white for the first time, to assuage the complaints of mariners who said the brick was difficult to see. It remained that color until 1975, when it was sand blasted, and returned to its natural color. The lantern is capped by a copper roof.
