History[edit]
Foundation[edit]




University council's first meeting in 1949


The origins of the university can be traced to the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts established in 1833 and the Sydney Technical College established in 1878.[5] These institutions were established to meet the growing demand for capabilities in new technologies as the New South Wales economy shifted from its pastoral base to industries fueled by the industrial age.[5]
The idea of founding the university originated from the crisis demands of World War II, during which the nation's attention was drawn to the critical role that science and technology played in transforming an agricultural society into a modern and industrial one.[6] The post-war Labor government of New South Wales recognised the increasing need to have a university specialised in training high-quality engineers and technology-related professionals in numbers beyond that of the capacity and characteristics of the existing University of Sydney.[6] This led to the proposal to establish the Institute of Technology, submitted by the then New South Wales Minister for Education Bob Heffron, accepted on 9 July 1946.
The university, originally named the "New South Wales University of Technology", gained its statutory status through the enactment of the New South Wales University of Technology Act 1949 (NSW) by the Parliament of New South Wales in Sydney in 1949.
Early years[edit]
In March 1948, classes commenced with a first intake of 46 students pursuing programs including civil engineering, mechanical engineering, mining engineering and electrical engineering.[7] At that time the thesis programs were innovative. Each course embodied a specified and substantial period of practical training in the relevant industry. It was also unprecedented for tertiary institutions at that time to include compulsory instruction in humanities.[8]
Initially, the university operated from the inner Sydney Technical College city campus in Ultimo. However, in 1951, the Parliament of New South Wales passed the New South Wales University of Technology (Construction) Act 1951 (NSW) to provide funding and allow buildings to be erected at the Kensington site where the university is now located.
Expansion[edit]
In 1958, the university's name was changed to the "University of New South Wales" to reflect its transformation from a technology-based institution to a generalist university. In 1960, it established faculties of arts and medicine and shortly after decided to add the Faculty of Law, which came into being in 1971.[9]
The university's first director was Arthur Denning (1949–1952), who made important contributions to founding the university. In 1953, he was replaced by Philip Baxter, who continued as vice-chancellor when this position's title was changed in 1955.[10] Baxter's dynamic, if authoritarian, management was central to the university's first 20 years. His visionary, but at times controversial, energies saw the university grow from a handful to 15,000 students by 1968.[11] The new vice-chancellor, Rupert Myers (1969–1981), brought consolidation and an urbane management style to a period of expanding student numbers, demand for change in university style and challenges of student unrest.
The stabilising techniques of the 1980s managed by the vice-chancellor, Michael Birt (1981–1992),[12] provided a firm base for the energetic corporatism and campus enhancements pursued by the subsequent vice-chancellor, John Niland (1992–2002). The 1990s saw the addition of fine arts to the university. The university established colleges in Newcastle (1951) and Wollongong (1961), which eventually became the University of Newcastle and the University of Wollongong in 1965 and 1975 respectively.
Recent history[edit]
In 2012 private sources contributed 45% of the University's annual funding.[13]
The university is home to the Lowy Cancer Research Centre, one of Australia's largest cancer research facilities. The centre, costing $127 million, is Australia's first facility to bring together researchers in childhood and adult cancer.[14][15]
In 2003, the university was invited by Singapore's Economic Development Board to consider opening a campus there. Following a 2004 decision to proceed, the first phase of a planned $200 m campus opened in 2007. Students and staff were sent home and the campus closed after one semester following substantial financial losses.[16]
Symbols[edit]
The Grant of Arms was made by the College of Arms on 3 March 1952. The grant reads:

Argent on a Cross Gules a Lion passant guardant between four Mullets of eight points Or a Chief Sable charged with an open Book proper thereon the word "SCIENTIA" in letters also sable.[17]

The lion and the four stars of the Southern Cross on the St George's Cross have reference to the State of New South Wales which established the university; the open book with scientia ("knowledge") across its pages is a reminder of its purpose. The placement of scientia on the book was inspired by its appearance on the arms of the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine formed in 1907. Beneath the shield is the motto Manu et Mente ("With hand and mind"), which was the motto of the Sydney Technical College from which the university developed.[18]
An update of the design and colours of the arms was undertaken in 1970, which provided a more contemporary design, yet retained all the arms' heraldic associations. In 1994 the university title was added to the UNSW arms, as was the abbreviation "UNSW", to create the UNSW symbol which is used for everyday and marketing purposes.[18]
The ceremonial mace of the university is made of stainless steel with silver facings and a shaft of eumung timber. On the head are mounted four silver shields, two engraved with the arms of the State of New South Wales and two with the original-design arms of the university. A silver Waratah, NSW's floral emblem, surmounts the head. The mace was donated to the university by Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and was presented by the company's chairman, Colin Syme, on 6 December 1962.[19] A former NSW Government Architect, Cobden Parkes, was appointed as the first official mace-bearer.[20]
Campus[edit]

Quadrangle Building


The main UNSW campus, where most faculties are situated, is in Kensington, Sydney. UNSW Art & Design is located in the inner suburb of Paddington, and UNSW Canberra at ADFA is situated in Canberra.
The main UNSW campus is divided geographically into two areas: upper campus and lower campus. The lower campus area was vested in the university in two lots in December 1952 and June 1954. The upper campus area was vested in the university in November 1959.[21] These two are separated mainly by an elevation rise between the quadrangle and the Scientia building. It takes roughly fifteen minutes to walk from one extreme to the other.
UNSW also has Ucroo's Digital Campus which seamlessly and intelligently connects the university body.
The university also has additional campuses and field stations in Randwick, Coogee, Botany, Dee Why, Cowan, Manly Vale, Fowlers Gap, Albury, Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour and at Bankstown Airport.




Library Lawn, upper campus


The university has a number of purpose-built research facilities, including:

UNSW Lowy Cancer Research Centre is a facility at the university. It is Australia's first facility bringing together researchers in childhood and adult cancers as well as one of the country's largest cancer research facilities, housing up to 400 researchers.
The Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre is a centre for the faculties of science, medicine and engineering. It is used to study the structure and composition of biological, chemical and physical materials.

There are a number of theatre and music venues at the university, many of which are available for hire to the general public. The UNSW Fitness and Aquatic Centre provides health and fitness facilities and services to both students and the general public.[22][23]
Governance[edit]




Main Walkway, Lower campus


The university is governed by the University Council which is responsible for acting on the university's behalf to promote its objectives and interests.[24] The Council comprises 15 members including the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, President of the Academic Board, two members appointed by the Minister for Education, five members appointed by the Council, three members elected by university staff, and two student elected members.[25]
The principal academic body is the Academic Board, which receives advice on academic matters from the faculties, college (Australian Defence Force Academy), and the boards of studies.[26] It is responsible for academic policy setting, academic strategy via its eight standing committees, approval and delivery of programs, and academic standards.[26] The Board comprises 59 members, including the Vice-Chancellor, members of the executive team, deans and faculty presiding members, members elected from the academic staff, and six from the student body.[27] The Board advises the Vice-Chancellor and council on matters relating to teaching, scholarship and research and takes decisions on delegation from the Council.
The chief executive officer of the university is the President and Vice-Chancellor,[28] currently Professor Ian Jacobs. The deputy vice-chancellors and pro-vice-chancellors form part of an executive team which are responsible for academic operations, research policy, research management, quality assurance and external relations including philanthropy and advancement.[26][29]
Each of the faculties has their respective boards are responsible for the teaching and examining of subjects within their scope.[30]
