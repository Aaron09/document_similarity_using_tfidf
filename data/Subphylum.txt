In zoological nomenclature, a subphylum is a taxonomic rank below the rank of phylum.
The taxonomic rank of "subdivision" in fungi and plant taxonomy is equivalent to "subphylum" in zoological taxonomy.
Taxonomic rank[edit]
Subphylum is:

subordinate to the phylum
superordinate to the infraphylum.

Where convenient, subphyla in turn may be divided into infraphyla; in turn such an infraphylum also would be superordinate to any classes or superclasses in the hierarchy.
Examples[edit]
Not all fauna phyla are divided into subphyla. Those that are include:

Arthropoda: divided into subphyla Trilobitomorpha, Chelicerata, Myriapoda, Hexapoda and Crustacea,
Brachiopoda: divided into subphyla Linguliformea, Craniformea and Rhynchonelliformea,
Chordata: divided into Tunicata, Cephalochordata, and its largest subphylum Vertebrata.

Examples of infraphyla include the Mycetozoa and the Gnathostomata.
