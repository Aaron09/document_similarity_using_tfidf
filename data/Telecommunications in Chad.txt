Radio and television[edit]
Radio stations:

state-owned radio network, Radiodiffusion Nationale Tchadienne (RNT), operates national and regional stations; about 10 private radio stations; some stations rebroadcast programs from international broadcasters (2007);[1]
2 AM, 4 FM, and 5 shortwave stations (2001).[2]

Radios: 1.7 million (1997).[needs update]
Television stations:

1 state-owned TV station, Tele Tchad (2007);[1]
1 station (2001).[2]

Television sets: 10,000 (1997).[needs update]
Radio is the most important medium of mass communication. State-run Radiodiffusion Nationale Tchadienne operates national and regional radio stations. Around a dozen private radio stations are on the air, despite high licensing fees, some run by religious or other non-profit groups. The BBC World Service (FM 90.6) and Radio France Internationale (RFI) broadcast in the capital, N'Djamena. The only television station, Tele Tchad, is state-owned.[3][4]
State control of many broadcasting outlets allows few dissenting views.[3] Journalists are harassed and attacked. On rare occasions journalists are warned in writing by the High Council for Communication to produce more "responsible" journalism or face fines. Some journalists and publishers practice self-censorship. On 10 October 2012, the High Council on Communications issued a formal warning to La Voix du Paysan, claiming that the station’s live broadcast on 30 September incited the public to "insurrection against the government." The station had broadcast a sermon by a bishop who criticized the government for allegedly failing to use oil wealth to benefit the region.[4]

Internet censorship and surveillance[edit]
See also: Media of Chad and Human rights in Chad
There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms.[4]
The constitution provides for freedom of opinion, expression, and press, but the government does not always respect these rights. Private individuals are generally free to criticize the government without reprisal, but reporters and publishers risk harassment from authorities when publishing critical articles. The 2010 media law abolished prison sentences for defamation and insult, but prohibits "inciting racial, ethnic, or religious hatred," which is punishable by one to two years in prison and a fine of one to three million CFA francs ($2,000 to $6,000).[4]
