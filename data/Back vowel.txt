A back vowel is any in a class of vowel sound used in spoken languages. The defining characteristic of a back vowel is that the tongue is positioned as far back as possible in the mouth without creating a constriction that would be classified as a consonant. Back vowels are sometimes also called dark vowels because they are perceived as sounding darker than the front vowels.[1]
Near-back vowels are essentially a type of back vowels; no language is known to contrast back and near-back vowels based on backness alone.

Articulation[edit]
In their articulation, back vowels do not form a single category, but may be either raised vowels such as [u] or retracted vowels such as [ɑ].[2]
Unrounded back vowels are typically centralized, that is, near-back in their articulation. This is one reason they are written to the left of rounded back vowels in the IPA vowel chart.
Partial list[edit]
The back vowels that have dedicated symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet are:

close back unrounded vowel [ɯ]
close back protruded vowel [u]
close-mid back unrounded vowel [ɤ]
close-mid back rounded vowel [o]
open-mid back unrounded vowel [ʌ]
open-mid back rounded vowel [ɔ]
open back unrounded vowel [ɑ]
open back rounded vowel [ɒ]

There also are back vowels that don't have dedicated symbols in the IPA:

close back compressed vowel [ɯᵝ] or [uᵝ]
mid back unrounded vowel [ɤ̞] or [ʌ̝] (normally written ⟨ɤ⟩ as if it were close-mid)
mid back rounded vowel [o̞] or [ɔ̝] (normally written ⟨o⟩ as if it were close-mid)

As here, other back vowels can be transcribed with diacritics of relative articulation applied to letters for neighboring vowels, such as ⟨u̞⟩, ⟨o̝⟩ or ⟨ʊ̟⟩ for a near-close back rounded vowel.
