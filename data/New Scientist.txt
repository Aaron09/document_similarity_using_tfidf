New Scientist is a weekly English-language international science magazine, founded in 1956. Since 1996 it has also run a website.
Sold in retail outlets and on subscription, the magazine covers current developments, news, reviews and commentary on science and technology. It also publishes speculative articles, ranging from the technical to the philosophical. A readers' letters section discusses recent articles, and discussions also take place on the website.
Readers contribute observations on examples of pseudoscience to Feedback, and offer questions and answers on scientific and technical topics to Last Word; extracts from the latter have been compiled into several books.
New Scientist, based in London, publishes editions in the UK, the United States, and Australia.

History[edit]
The magazine was founded in 1956 by Tom Margerison, Max Raison and Nicholas Harrison[2] as The New Scientist, with Issue 1 on 22 November, priced one shilling (£0.05 as 20 shillings in the £; £1.15 today).[3]
The British monthly science magazine Science Journal, published 1965–71, was merged with New Scientist to form New Scientist and Science Journal.[4]
Originally, the cover of New Scientist had a list of articles rather than a picture.[5] Pages were numbered sequentially for an entire quarterly volume, as is the norm for academic journals (i.e., so that the first page of a March issue could be 651 instead of 1). Later issues numbered pages separately. Until the 1970s, colour was not used except for on the cover. From the beginning of 1961 "The" was dropped from the title. From 1965, the front cover was illustrated.[6]
Since its first issue, New Scientist has written about the applications of science, through its coverage of technology. For example, the first issue included an article "Where next from Calder Hall?" on the future of nuclear power in the UK, a topic that it has covered throughout its history. In 1964 there was a regular "Science in British Industry" section with several items.[7]
An article in the magazine's 10th anniversary issues provides anecdotes on the founding of the magazine.[2]
In 1970, the Reed Group, which went on to become Reed Elsevier, acquired New Scientist when it merged with IPC Magazines. Reed retained the magazine when it sold most of its consumer titles in a management buyout to what is now IPC Media.
Throughout most of its history, New Scientist has published cartoons as light relief and comment on the news, with contributions from such long-time regular contributors as Mike Peyton and David Austin. The Grimbledon Down comic strip, by the renowned cartoonist Bill Tidy, appeared from 1970 to 1994.
Ariadne, which later moved to Nature, commented weekly on the lighter side of science and technology, with the plausible but impractical humorous inventions of (fictitious) inventor Daedalus, often developed by the (fictitious) DREADCO corporation.[8]
Issues of (The) New Scientist from Issue 1 to the end of 1989 have been made free to read online.[9] Subsequent issues require a subscription.[10]
In the first half of 2013, the international circulation of New Scientist averaged 125,172. While this was a 4.3% reduction on the previous year's figure, it was a much smaller reduction in circulation than many mainstream magazines of similar or greater circulation.[11] For the 2014 UK circulation fell by 3.2% but stronger international sales, increased the circulation to 129,585.[12] See also #Website below.
In April 2017, New Scientist changed hands when RELX Group, formerly known as Reed Elsevier, sold the magazine to Kingston Acquisitions. [13][14] Kingston Acquisitions then renamed itself New Scientist Ltd.

Since 2016 New Scientist has held a science festival annually in London, styled New Scientist Live, which has attracted high-profile scientists and science presenters.[21]
Criticism[edit]
Greg Egan's criticism of the EmDrive article[edit]
In September 2006, New Scientist was criticised by science fiction writer Greg Egan, who wrote that "a sensationalist bent and a lack of basic knowledge by its writers" was making the magazine's coverage sufficiently unreliable "to constitute a real threat to the public understanding of science". In particular, Egan found himself "gobsmacked by the level of scientific illiteracy" in the magazine's coverage of Roger Shawyer's "electromagnetic drive", where New Scientist allowed the publication of "meaningless double-talk" designed to bypass a fatal objection to Shawyer's proposed space drive, namely that it violates the law of conservation of momentum. Egan urged others to write to New Scientist and pressure the magazine to raise its standards, instead of "squandering the opportunity that the magazine's circulation and prestige provides".[22]
The editor of New Scientist, then Jeremy Webb, replied defending the article, saying that it is "an ideas magazine—that means writing about hypotheses as well as theories".[23]
"Darwin was wrong" cover[edit]
In January 2009, New Scientist ran a cover with the title "Darwin was wrong".[24] The actual story stated that specific details of Darwin's evolution theory had been shown incorrectly, mainly the shape of phylogenetic trees of interrelated species, which should be represented as a web instead of a tree. Some evolutionary biologists who actively oppose the intelligent design movement thought the cover was both sensationalist and damaging to the scientific community.[24][25] Jerry Coyne, author of the book Why Evolution Is True, called for a boycott of the magazine, which was supported by evolutionary biologists Richard Dawkins and P.Z. Myers.[24]
