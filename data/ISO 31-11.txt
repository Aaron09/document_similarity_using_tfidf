ISO 31-11 was the part of international standard ISO 31 that defines mathematical signs and symbols for use in physical sciences and technology. It was superseded in 2009 by ISO 80000-2.[1]
Its definitions include the following:[2]

Mathematical logic[edit]


Sign
Example
Name
Meaning and verbal equivalent
Remarks


∧
p ∧ q
conjunction sign
p and q



∨
p ∨ q
disjunction sign
p or q (or both)



¬
¬ p
negation sign
negation of p; not p; non p



⇒
p ⇒ q
implication sign
if p then q; p implies q
Can also be written as q ⇐ p. Sometimes → is used.


∀
∀x∈A p(x)
(∀x∈A) p(x)
universal quantifier
for every x belonging to A, the proposition p(x) is true
The "∈A" can be dropped where A is clear from context.


∃
∃x∈A p(x)
(∃x∈A) p(x)
existential quantifier
there exists an x belonging to A for which the proposition p(x) is true
The "∈A" can be dropped where A is clear from context.
∃! is used where exactly one x exists for which p(x) is true.


Sets[edit]

Remarks
