Notes[edit]



^ Based on entries in the National Register Information Database as of April 24, 2008 and new weekly listings posted since then on the National Register of Historic Places web site. Frequent additions to the listings and occasional delistings are made, so the counts here are approximate and not official. New entries are added to the official Register on a weekly basis. Also, the counts in this table exclude boundary increase and decrease listings which modify the area covered by an existing property or district and which carry a separate National Register reference number. The numbers of NRHP listings in each county are documented by tables in each of the individual county list-articles.
^ The following sites are listed in multiple counties:

Bartlett Commercial Historic District (Bell and Williamson)
Butterfield Mail Corridor (Culberson and Hudspeth)
Cuero I Archeological District (DeWitt and Gonzales)
Enchanted Rock Archeological District (Gillespie and Llano)
King Ranch (Kenedy, Kleberg, Nueces and Willacy)
Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park (Blanco and Gillespie)
Mansfield Cut Underwater Archeological District (Kenedy and Willacy)
Port Arthur-Orange Bridge (Jefferson and Orange)
Regency Suspension Bridge (Mills and San Saba)
Riverside Swinging Bridge (Trinity and Walker)
State Highway 3-A Bridge at Cibolo Creek (Bexar and Guadalupe)
State Highway 19 Bridge at Trinity River (Trinity and Walker)
State Highway 29 Bridge at the Colorado River (Burnet and Llano)
State Highway 34 Bridge at the Trinity River (Ellis and Kaufman)
US 190 Bridge at the Colorado River (Lampasas and San Saba)
US 190 Bridge at the Neches River (Jasper and Tyler)





References[edit]



^ The latitude and longitude information provided in this table was derived originally from the National Register Information System, which has been found to be fairly accurate for about 99% of listings. For about 1% of NRIS original coordinates, experience has shown that one or both coordinates are typos or otherwise extremely far off; some corrections may have been made. A more subtle problem causes many locations to be off by up to 150 yards, depending on location in the country: most NRIS coordinates were derived from tracing out latitude and longitudes off of USGS topographical quadrant maps created under the North American Datum of 1927, which differs from the current, highly accurate WGS84 GPS system used by most on-line maps. Chicago is about right, but NRIS longitudes in Washington are higher by about 4.5 seconds, and are lower by about 2.0 seconds in Maine. Latitudes differ by about 1.0 second in Florida. Some locations in this table may have been corrected to current GPS standards.
