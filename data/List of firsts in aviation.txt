The forerunners[edit]
First alleged human flights[edit]

In the year 559, several prisoners of Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi, including Yuan Huangtou of Ye, were forced to launch themselves from a tower attached to a kite, as an experiment. Yuan Huangtou was the sole survivor, successfully gliding over the city walls. He was later executed.[1]
Abbas Ibn Firnas (810–887), a Muslim Andalusian polymath, is rumored to have made a successful attempt at flying, according to the account of the historian Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari seven centuries later. He built his own glider, and launched himself from a mountain.[2]
In the early 11th century (possibly first decade), Eilmer of Malmesbury, an English Benedictine monk, attempted a gliding flight using wings. According to the Gesta Regum Anglorum, Eilmer travelled over a furlong (660 feet, 201 metres) through the air before falling and breaking both his legs, rendering him lame for the rest of his life.[3]
Hezarfen Ahmed Celebi, unpowered gliding flight over the Bosphorus strait from the Galata Tower to Uskudar district in Istanbul between 1630–1632.[4][5]
In 1633, Lagari Hasan Çelebi, brother of Hezarfen Ahmed Celebi launched in a 7-winged rocket using 50 okka (140 lbs) of gunpowder from Sarayburnu, the point below Topkapı Palace in Istanbul.[6][7]
Albrecht Berblinger (dubbed The Tailor from Ulm) is believed to have constructed a primitive hang glider in Ulm, Germany. Urged to make a public demonstration on May 30, 1811, he failed due to limited thermal updrafts over the cold Danube.

First successful jump from a balloon with a parachute: Andre Jacques Garnerin in Paris in 1797.[16]
First woman to jump from a balloon with a parachute: Jeanne Geneviève Labrosse jumped from an altitude of 900 metres (3,000 ft) on October 12, 1799.[citation needed]
