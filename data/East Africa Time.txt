East Africa Time, or EAT, is a time zone used in eastern Africa. The zone is three hours ahead of UTC (UTC+3), which is the same as Arabia Standard Time, Further-eastern European Time, Moscow Time and Eastern European Summer Time.[1]
As this Time Zone is predominantly in the equatorial region, there is no significant change in day length throughout the year and so daylight saving time is not observed.[2]
East Africa Time is used by the following countries:

 Comoros
 Djibouti
 Eritrea
 Ethiopia
 Kenya
 Madagascar
 Somalia
 South Sudan
 Tanzania
 Uganda
