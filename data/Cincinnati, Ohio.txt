Cincinnati (/ˌsɪnsɪˈnæti/ SIN-sih-NAT-ee) is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and seat of Hamilton County.[7] Cincinnati is within one-day street drive for two-thirds of United States populaces.[8][9][10] Settled 1788, the city was located at the north side of the confluence of the Licking River to the Ohio. The city drives the Cincinnati–Middletown–Wilmington combined statistical area, which had a population of 2,172,191 in the 2010 census.[11] With a population of 298,800, Cincinnati holds the third-biggest city proper in Ohio and the 65th-biggest in the United States. It has the fastest growing economic power of the Midwestern United States[12] and 28th-biggest metropolitan statistical area in the United States, the biggest in Ohio. In the nineteenth century, Cincinnati was an American boomtown in the heart of the country; it rivaled the larger coastal cities in size and wealth. Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by New Orleans and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard; and sixth-biggest city for a period spanning reports from 1840 until 1860. It became the greatest city in the West. As Cincinnati is the first city founded after the American Revolution as well as the first major inland city in the country, the city is thought of as the first purely "American" City.[13]
Cincinnati developed with fewer European immigrants or influence than eastern cities attracted in the same period; however, it received a significant number of German immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions. By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly Chicago, which developed based on commodity exploitation and the railroads, and St. Louis, for decades after the Civil War the gateway to westward migration.
Cincinnati is home to two major sports clubs, the Cincinnati Reds, the oldest team in Major League Baseball, and the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League. The University of Cincinnati, founded in 1819, is one of the 50 largest in the United States.[14] Cincinnati is known for its historic architecture. In the late 1800s, Cincinnati was commonly referred to as "Paris of America", due mainly to such ambitious architectural projects as the Music Hall, Cincinnatian Hotel, and Shillito Department Store.[15] Cincinnati is also the birthplace of William Howard Taft, the 27th President of the United States.

History[edit]




Cincinnati in 1812 with a population of 2,000[16]


Main article: History of Cincinnati
See also: Timeline of Cincinnati and History of Ohio
Cincinnati began in 1788 when Mathias Denman, Colonel Robert Patterson and Israel Ludlow landed at the spot at the northern bank of the Ohio opposite the mouth of the Licking and decided to settle there. The original surveyor, John Filson, named it "Losantiville".[17] In 1790, Arthur St. Clair, the governor of the Northwest Territory, changed the name of the settlement to "Cincinnati" in honor of the Society of the Cincinnati, made up of Revolutionary War veterans, of which he was a member;[18] Cincinnati, herein, being many like meaning bearers of the City. Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, dictator in the early Roman Republic who saved Romans from crisis, retired to farming because he didn't want to rule.[19]
The introduction of steamboats on the Ohio in 1811 opened up its trade to more rapid shipping, and the city established commercial ties with St. Louis, Missouri and especially New Orleans downriver. Cincinnati was incorporated as a city in 1819. Exporting pork products and hay, it became a center of pork processing in the region. From 1810 to 1830 its population nearly tripled, from 9,642 to 24,831.[20] Completion of the Miami and Erie Canal in 1827 to Middletown, Ohio further stimulated businesses, and employers struggled to hire enough people to fill positions. The city had a labor shortage until large waves of immigration by Irish and Germans in the late 1840s. The city grew rapidly over the next two decades, reaching 115,000 persons by 1850.[18]
Construction on the Miami and Erie Canal began on July 21, 1825, when it was called the Miami Canal, related to its origin at the Great Miami River. The first section of the canal was opened for business in 1827.[21] In 1827, the canal connected Cincinnati to nearby Middletown; by 1840, it had reached Toledo. During this period of rapid expansion and prominence, residents of Cincinnati began referring to the city as the Queen City.
Industrial takeoff and Gilded years[edit]
After the steamboats, railroads were the next major form of commercial transportation to come to Cincinnati. In 1836, the Little Miami Railroad was chartered.[22] Construction began soon after, to connect Cincinnati with the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad, and provide access to the ports of the Sandusky Bay on Lake Erie.[21]

In 1859, Cincinnati laid out six streetcar lines; the cars were pulled by horses and the lines made it easier for people to get around the city.[22] By 1872, Cincinnatians could travel on the streetcars within the city and transfer to rail cars for travel to the hill communities. The Cincinnati Inclined Plane Company began transporting people to the top of Mount Auburn that year.[21]
In 1880, the city government completed the Cincinnati Southern Railway to Chattanooga, Tennessee. It is the only municipality-owned interstate railway in the United States.
In 1884, outrage over a manslaughter verdict in what many observers thought was a clear case of murder triggered the Courthouse riots, one of the most destructive riots in American history. Over the course of three days, 56 people were killed and over 300 were injured.[23] The riots ended the regime of political bosses John Roll McLean and Thomas C. Campbell in Cincinnati. In 1889, the Cincinnati streetcar system began converting its horse-drawn cars to electric streetcars.[24]
During the Great Depression[edit]
An early rejuvenation of downtown began in the 1920s and continued into the next decade with the construction of Union Terminal, the post office, and the large Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building. Cincinnati weathered the Great Depression better than most American cities of its size, largely because of a resurgence in river trade, which was less expensive than transporting goods by rail. The flood in 1937 was one of the worst in the nation's history and destroyed many areas along the Ohio Valley. Afterward the city built protective flood walls.
Society[edit]
Main article: Culture of Cincinnati
Like all major cities in United States, Cincinnati was proliferated by Americans, but also Ulster Scots known as the Scots Irish, frontiersfolk, and keelboaters. The same populace guides the city through hey and advent. Overtime, Americans and their Scots-Irish kin developed exurbs like Williamsburg, and are key to the suburbia that grew outward after the 1940s. All areas, including western, eastern, and northern areas of what is called Greater Cincinnati, are mainline. For this fact, most of Cincinnati's longtime settled have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana tristate and deeper. The first Methodist class was brought about in 1798, instrumental to public schools, many citygoers inspired by Methodist circuit preachers, offering branches such as the German Methodist Church, and leading to City bedrock institutes like: The Christ Hospital.




Tall Stacks, held every three or four years, celebrates the city's riverboat heritage.


Cincinnati, being on the heartland plane, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio, at a time when thousands of blacks were settling in the free state of Ohio, most from Kentucky and Virginia and some of them fugitives seeking freedom in the North. Many came to find work in Cincinnati. In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, most of all Pennsylvania. In 1841, twenty-six percent of whites were from the South and fifty-seven percent from the eastern states, mostly Penna.[25] They retained their cultural support for slavery. This led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of abolitionism and lifting restrictions on free people of color, as codified in the "Black Code" of 1804.[26]
Germans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee. General David Ziegler succeeded General St. Clair in command at Fort Washington. After the conclusion of the Northwest Indian Wars and removal of Native Americans to the west, he was elected as the mayor of Cincinnati in 1802.[27] Cincinnati was influenced by Irishmen, Prussians, and Saxons seeking to emigrate away from crowding or strife. In 1830 residents with German roots made up 5% of the population, as many had migrated from Pennsylvania; ten years later this had increased to 30%.[28] Thousands of German immigrants entered the city after the Prussian revolution of 1848 and by 1900, more than 60 percent of its population was of German background.[29] The menial-jobbed, aggravated Irish often organized mobs and the Germans, faraway from their Pennsylvania Dutch connexion, dealt alike—leaders of the city had to use fortifying measures against arrivals' clashes.




The Tyler Davidson Fountain, a symbol of Cincinnati, was dedicated in 1871.


Volatile social conditions saw riots in 1829, when many blacks lost their homes and property. As the Irish entered the city in the late 1840s, they competed with blacks at the lower levels of the economy. White-led riots against blacks occurred in 1836, when an abolitionist press was twice destroyed; and in 1842.[26] More than one thousand blacks abandoned the city after the 1829 riots. Blacks in Philadelphia and other major cities raised money to help the refugees recover from the destruction. By 1842 blacks had become better established in the city; they defended their persons and property in the riot, and worked politically as well.[30]
The emigres, while having been widely discussed, never overtook settlers in population. Cincinnati has a great preservative quality which, despite fierce sugarcoating of late, piques interest throughout United States as a great city of the North, South, East, and West. Waynesville, Ohio, hosts the yearly Ohio Sauerkraut Festival,[31] and Cincinnati hosts several big yearly events which commemorate connections to the Old World. Oktoberfest Zinzinnati,[32] Bockfest,[33] and the Taste of Cincinnati that feature local restaurateurs.
Cincinnati's Jewish community was developed by those from England and Germany.[citation needed] They developed Reform Judaism in response to the influences of the Enlightenment and making their new lives in the United States.[citation needed] Isaac M. Wise Temple was the first Reform Judaism temple to be built, breaking away from Conservative and Orthodox Judaism.[citation needed]
Society, in a finer sense, and then the greater aspect of society which also deals in business, both have stayed communal in Cincinnati compared to metropolises along the United States coasts. Cincinnati is a national city: The NRHP-listed Potter Stewart United States Courthouse is a federal court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, one of thirteen United States courts of appeals. Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Cincinnati Branch is located across the street from the East Fourth Street Historic District.
Economy[edit]

Procter & Gamble is one of many large corporations with headquarters in the city.


Cincinnati has the fastest-growing Midwestern economic capital.[12] The gross metropolitan product is $124 billion, and median household income is $73,868 (according to another source it was $33,604 in 2011-2015[34]). The median home price is $158,200, and the cost of living in Cincinnati is 8% below national average. The unemployment rate is also below the average at 4.2%.[35]
Several Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Cincinnati, such as Procter & Gamble, The Kroger Company, and Macy's, Inc., among others. General Electric has headquartered both their GE Aviation business and their Global Operations[36] center in Cincinnati. The Kroger Company employs 21,646 people locally, making it the largest employer in the city, and the University of Cincinnati is the second largest at 16,000.[37]
Food[edit]




Approximately 1,000,000 attend Taste of Cincinnati yearly, making it one of the largest street festivals in the United States.[38]


Cincinnati customary delights come from traditional food of colonial fare, like baked beans. United States meals feature vegetables, like sweet potatoes, also called yams, collard greens, stewed tomatoes, okra, corn bread, mashed potatoes, cole slaw, bean salads, and broths, and traditionally carrots, green beans, mushrooms, spinach, and sweet peas. Fare also connects the City's German heritage. While most of Cincinnati German eats is fare of the States of Prussia and Saxony, where the tristate Germans were from, restaurants also carry schnitzels and in Bavarian cooking.
Famous lines[edit]
Frisch's Big Boy Salad Bar, Graeter's Ice Cream, Kroger, LaRosa's, and Montgomery Inn, and United Dairy Farmers (UDF/Trauth) are all famous Cincinnati eateries that sell their brand commodities in grocery markets and fuel stations. The 'Wich on Sycamore offers lunches during the workweek. More secrets of Cincinnati fare include the National Exemplar in Mariemont, the Schoolhouse Restaurant near Camp Dennison, and Rockbottom Café, which serves vegan, next to the square.
Cincinnati has many[quantify] gourmet restaurants. The Maisonette in Cincinnati had the distinction of being Mobil Travel Guide's longest-running five-star restaurant in the United States of America, holding that distinction for 41 consecutive years until it closed in 2005. Jean-Robert de Cavel has opened four new restaurants in the area since 2001, including Jean-Robert's at Pigall's; this closed in March 2009.
One of United States' oldest[39] and most celebrated[40] bars, Arnold's Bar and Grill in Downtown Cincinnati has won awards and accolades from several national and regional media publications, including Esquire magazine's "Best Bars in America",[41] Thrillist's "Most Iconic Bar in Ohio",[42] The Daily Meal's "150 Best bars in America"[43] and Seriouseats.com's "The Cincinnati 10".[44] America's Foremost Cocktail Guru,[45] David Wondrich stated that "if Arnold's were in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, or Boston – somewhere, in short, that people actually visit – it would be world-famous."[39]
Cincinnati chili[edit]
Main article: Cincinnati chili
Cincinnati chili, a fined and spiced sauce served over noodles or rice, and often with diced onions and mustard, is the area's "best-known regional food."[46][47] A variety of recipes are served by respective parlors, including Skyline Chili, Gold Star Chili, and Dixie Chili and Deli, plus independent chili parlors including Camp Washington Chili and Moonlight Chili.[48] Cincinnati has been called[by whom?] the "Chili Capital of America" and "of the World" because it has more chili restaurants per capita than any other city in the United States or in the world.[49]
Dialect[edit]
Cincinnati speaks General American. Unlike the rest of the Midwest, Southwest Ohio shares some aspects of its vowel system with northern New Jersey English.[50][51] Cincinnatians, it is said, over-pronounce "O" so the affect comes to be heard with a rounded "w," perhaps from living on the Ohio whose four-letter name carries two "o"s. Most of the distinctive local features among speakers float as Midland American.[52] There is also some influence from the Southern American dialect found in Kentucky.[53] A touch of northern German is audible in the local vernacular: some residents use the word please when asking a speaker to repeat a statement. This usage is taken from the German practice, when bitte (a shortening of the formal, "Wie bitte?" or "How please?" rendered word for word from German into English), was used as shorthand for asking someone to repeat.[54][55] The metro area hosts many call centers for a "lack of accent."

For decades the Census Bureau had been reporting a steady decline in the city's population as residents moved out to new suburbs in the postwar years, aided by newly built highways. In addition, industrial restructuring cost a loss of jobs in the late 20th century. But, according to the Census Bureau's 2006 estimates, the population was 332,252, representing a slight increase from 331,310 in 2005.[64] The city had officially challenged the original census numbers. Mayor Mark Mallory repeatedly argued that the city's population is 378,259, after a drill-down study was performed by an independent, non-profit group based in Washington, D.C.[65]

As of the U.S. Census Bureau's July 2014 estimate, the population was 298,165, down nearly 35,000 from 2006 but up slightly from 296,918 in July 2010.
As of the 2010 census, the racial demographics for the city of Cincinnati were: 49.3% white (48.1% non-Hispanic white), 44.8% black or African-American, 0.3% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 1.8% Asian, 0.1% Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 2.5% two or more races, and 2.8% Hispanic (of any race).[66]
As of the 2000 census, the Cincinnati-Middletown−Wilmington Metropolitan Statistical Area has a population of 2,155,137 people, making it the 24th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the country. It includes the Ohio counties of Hamilton, Butler, Warren, Clermont, Clinton and Brown, as well as the Kentucky counties of Boone, Bracken, Campbell, Gallatin, Grant, Kenton, and Pendleton, and the Indiana counties of Dearborn, Franklin, and Ohio.
Cityscape[edit]

The city is undergoing significant changes due to new development and private investment. This includes buildings of the long-stalled Banks project, that include apartments, retail, restaurants, and offices and will stretch from Great American Ball Park to Paul Brown Stadium. Phase 1A is already complete and 100 percent occupied as of early 2013. Smale Riverfront Park is being developed along with The Banks and is Cincinnati's newest park. Nearly $3.5 billion has been invested in the urban core of Cincinnati (including Northern Kentucky). Much of this development has been undertaken by 3CDC. The Cincinnati Bell Connector began in September 2016.[67][68]




Cincinnati is in the bluegrass region of Ohio.


Cincinnati is midway by river between the cities of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Cairo, Illinois. The downtown lies near the mouth of the Licking, a confluence whereabout the city settlement.[69] The city area spans southern Ohio and Indiana, and northern Kentucky, and the census bureau has measured the it at 79.54 square miles (206.01 km2), of which 77.94 square miles (201.86 km2) are land and 1.60 square miles (4.14 km2) are water.[1] The city spreads over a number of hills, bluffs, and low ridges overlooking the Ohio in the Bluegrass region of the country.[70] The tristate is geographically located within the Midwest and is on the far northern periphery of the Upland South.
Three municipalities are ensconced within the City: Norwood, Elmwood Place, and Saint Bernard. Norwood is a significant business and industrial city, while Elmwood Place and Saint Bernard are small, primarily residential, villages. Cincinnati does not have an exclave, but the city government does own several properties outside the corporation limits: French Park in Amberley Village, the disused runway at the former Blue Ash Airport in Blue Ash, and the 337-mile-long (542 km) Cincinnati Southern Railway, which runs between Cincinnati and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Cincinnati is home to numerous embankments that are noteworthy due to their architectural characteristics or historic associations, as well as the Carew Tower, the Scripps Center, the Ingalls Building, Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal, and the Isaac M. Wise Temple.[71]
Queen City Square opened in January 2011. The building is the tallest in Cincinnati (surpassing the Carew Tower), and is the third tallest in Ohio, reaching a height of 665 feet.[72]
The mile-long Cincinnati Skywalk, which was completed in 1997, was shortened to bring more commerce, yet remains the viable way to walk downtown in bad weather.[73] The Cincinnati Zoo in Avondale is the second oldest zoo in the United States.[74]





Downtown Cincinnati



Waterscape[edit]




Cincinnati's East End neighborhood during the Great Flood of 1913.


Downtown Cincinnati towers about Fountain Square, the public square and event locale. Fountain Square was renovated in 2006.[75] Cincinnati rests along 22 miles (35 km) of riverfront about northern banks of the Ohio, stretching from California to Sayler Park, giving the mighty Ohio and its movements a prominent place in the life of the city.[76] Frequent flooding has hampered the growth of Cincinnati's municipal airport at Lunken Field and the Coney Island amusement park.[77] Downtown Cincinnati is protected from flooding by the Serpentine Wall at Yeatman's Cove and another flood wall built into Fort Washington Way.[78] Parts of Cincinnati also experience flooding from the Little Miami River and Mill Creek.
Since April 1, 1922, the Ohio flood stage at Cincinnati has officially been set at 52 feet (16 m), as measured from the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge. At this depth, the pumping station at the mouth of Mill Creek is activated.[79][80] From 1873 to 1898, the flood stage was 45 feet (14 m). From 1899 to March 31, 1922, it was 50 feet (15 m).[80] The Ohio reached its lowest level, less than 2 feet (0.61 m), in 1881; conversely, its all-time high water mark is 79 feet 11 7⁄8 inches (24.381 m), having crested January 26, 1937.[79][81] Various parts of Cincinnati flood at different points: Riverbend Music Center in the California neighborhood floods at 42 feet (13 m), while Sayler Park floods at 71 feet (22 m) and the Freeman Avenue flood gate closes at 75 feet (23 m).[79]
Cincinnati is at the southern limit of the humid continental climate zone (Köppen: Dfa).[82] Summers are warm to hot and humid, with significant rainfall in each month and highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) or above on 21 days per year, often with high dew points and humidity. July is the warmest month, with a daily average temperature of 75.9 °F (24.4 °C).[83]
Winters tend to be cold and snowy, with January, the coldest month, averaging at 30.8 °F (−0.7 °C).[83] Lows reach 0 °F (−18 °C) on an average 2.6 nights yearly.[83] An average winter will see around 22.1 inches (56 cm) of snowfall, contributing to the yearly 42.5 inches (1,080 mm) of weatherfall, with rainfall peaking in spring.[84] Extremes range from −25 °F (−32 °C) on January 18, 1977 up to 108 °F (42 °C) on July 21 and 22, 1934.[85] Severe thunderstorms are common in the warmer months, and tornadoes, while infrequent, are not unknown, with such events striking the Greater Cincinnati area most recently in 1974, 1999, 2012, and 2017.[86]
Sports[edit]
Main article: Sports in Cincinnati
Cincinnati has two major league teams, eight minor league teams, five college institutions with sports teams, and seven major sports venues. The Reds are the first professional baseball team, before, the Cincinnati Red Stockings;[87][88][89] and the Bengals of the National Football League. On Opening Day, Cincinnati keeps the "traditional opener" each year, due to its baseball. Many children skip school on Opening Day, and it is commonly thought of as a holiday.[90] The Flying Pig Marathon is a yearly event attracting many runners and so is the Cincinnati Masters Western & Southern tennis tourney. The Cincinnati Marlins are the swimmers club.

The Cincinnati Reds have won five World Series titles and had one of the most successful baseball teams of all time in the early 1970s, known as The Big Red Machine. The Bengals have made two Super Bowl appearances since its founding, in 1981 and 1988, but have yet to win a championship. As of 2016, the Bengals have the longest active playoff win drought (26 years) despite making five straight playoff appearances from 2011 to 2015. Whenever the Bengals and Carolina Panthers play against each other (an interconference matchup that occurs every four years), their games are dubbed the "Queen City Bowl", as Charlotte, North Carolina, the home city of the Panthers, is also known as the Queen City.[91] The Bengals enjoy strong rivalries with the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers (both of whom are also members of the AFC North).
Cincinnati is also home to two very successful men's college basketball teams: The Cincinnati Bearcats and Xavier Musketeers that face off in one of the fiercest college basketball rivalries known as the Crosstown Shootout.

The Musketeers have made 10 of the last 11 NCAA tournaments while the Bearcats have made six consecutive appearances. Previously, the Cincinnati Royals competed in the National Basketball Association from 1957 to 1972; they are now known as the Sacramento Kings.

Police and emergency services[edit]
See also: Crime in Cincinnati




Crime in Cincinnati increased after the 2001 riots, but has been decreasing since.


The city of Cincinnati's emergency services for fire, rescue, EMS, hazardous materials and explosive ordnance disposal is handled by the Cincinnati Fire Department. On April 1, 1853, the Cincinnati Fire Department became the first paid professional fire department in United States.[99] The Cincinnati Fire Department operates out of 26 fire stations, located throughout the city in 4 districts, each commanded by a district chief.[100][101][102]
The Cincinnati Fire Department is organized into 4 bureaus: Operations,[101] Personnel and Training,[103] Administrative Services,[104] and Fire Prevention.[105] Each bureau is commanded by an assistant chief, who in turn reports to the chief of department.
The Cincinnati Police Department has more than 1,000 sworn officers. Before the riots of 2001, Cincinnati's overall crime rate had been dropping steadily and by 1995 had reached its lowest point since 1992 but with more murders and rapes.[106] After the riot, violent crime increased, but crime has been on the decline since.[107] In 2015, there were 71 homicides.[108]
The Cincinnati Police Department was featured on TLC's Police Women of Cincinnati and on A&E's reality show The First 48.
Politics[edit]




The logo for the City of Cincinnati.


A misunderstanding is there are two sides of the metropolis, and further, that the Westside is papist, Cincinnati a sort of "Catholic oasis." This set of mistakes has led into the genre of fantasy by which the City's politics implodes along with its schools.
The city proper operates with a nine-member city council, whose members are elected at-large. Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of wards. The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the Republican Party dominated City politics, with the political machine of "Boss" Cox exerting control.
A reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, Murray Seasongood. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a council–manager government form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the City. From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by proportional representation and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.
In an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.[109] The PR/STV system had enabled minorities to enter local politics and gain seats on the city council more than they had before, in proportion to their share of the population. This made the government more representative of the residents of the city.[110] Overturning that charter, in 1957, all candidates had to run in a single race for the nine city council positions. The top nine vote-getters were elected (the "9-X system"), which favored candidates who could appeal to the entire geographic area of the city and reach its residents with campaign materials. The mayor was elected by the council. In 1977, thirty-three-year-old Jerry Springer, later a notable television talk show host, was chosen to serve one year as mayor.
One of the State's first five cashinos, now JACK, was opened downtown in 2013 after a ballot measure known as the Ohio Casino Initiative to provide gamblings for schools got plurality in 2009 for Amendment 3; this after two initiatives lost, 2006 and 2008. Cashino invocation for Ohio has never garnered a majority of said citizen votes.
Residents continued to work to improve their system.[citation needed] To have their votes count more, starting in 1987, the top vote-getter in the city council election was automatically selected as mayor. Mark Mallory, was featured on CBS's Undercover Boss. Starting in 1999, the mayor was elected separately in a general at-large election for the first time. The city manager's role in government was reduced.[citation needed] These reforms were referred to as the "strong mayor" reforms, to make the publicate accountable to voters. Cincinnati politics include the participation of the Charter Party, the political party with the third-longest history of winning in local elections.[citation needed]

The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center has exhibits on the Underground Railroad


Because of its location on the Ohio, Cincinnati was a border town in a free state, across from Kentucky, a slave state. Some residents of Cincinnati played a major role in abolitionism. Many fugitive slaves used the Ohio at Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, but there were also runaway slave catchers active in the city, who put escaping slaves at risk of recapture.
Given its southern Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters broke out in repeated violence, with whites attacking blacks in 1829. Anti-abolitionists attacked blacks in the city in a wave of destruction that resulted in 1,200 blacks leaving the city and the country; they resettled in Canada.[111] The riot and its refugees were topics of discussion throughout the country, and blacks organized the first Negro Convention in 1830 in Philadelphia to discuss these events.
White riots against blacks took place again in Cincinnati in 1836 and 1842.[111] In 1836, a mob of 700 pro-slavery men attacked black neighborhoods, as well as a press run by James M. Birney, publisher of the anti-slavery weekly The Philanthropist.[112] Tensions increased after congressional passage in 1850 of the Fugitive Slave Act, which required cooperation by citizens in free states and increased penalties for failing to try to recapture escaped slaves.
Levi Coffin made the Cincinnati area the center of his anti-slavery efforts in 1847.[113] Harriet Beecher Stowe lived in Cincinnati for a time, met escaped slaves, and used their stories as a basis for her novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, which opened in 2004 on the Cincinnati riverfront in the middle of "The Banks" area between Great American Ballpark and Paul Brown Stadium, commemorates the volunteers who aided refugee slaves and their drive for freedom, as well as others who have been leaders for social justice.




Findlay Market, Ohio's oldest operating market


Located in a free state and attracting many European immigrants, Cincinnati has historically had a predominantly white population.[62] By 1940, the Census Bureau reported the city's population as 87.8 percent white and 12.2 percent black.[62]
In the second half of the 20th century, Cincinnati, along with other rust belt cities, underwent a vast demographic transformation. By the early 21st century, the city's population was 40% black. Predominantly white, working-class families who constituted the urban core during the European immigration boom in the 19th and early 20th centuries, moved to newly constructed suburbs before and after World War II. Blacks, fleeing the oppression of the Jim Crow South in hopes of better socioeconomic opportunity, had moved to these older city neighborhoods in their Great Migration to the industrial North. The downturn in industry in the late 20th century caused a loss of many jobs, leaving many people in poverty. In 1968, passage of national civil rights legislation had raised hopes for positive change, but the assassination of national leader Martin Luther King, Jr. resulted in riots in many black neighborhoods in Cincinnati; black riots took place in nearly every major U.S. city after King's murder.
More than three decades later, in April 2001, racially charged riots occurred after police fatally shot a young unarmed black man, Timothy Thomas during a foot pursuit to arrest him, mostly for outstanding traffic warrants.[114] After the 2001 riots, the ACLU, Cincinnati Black United Front, city and police union agreed a community-oriented policing strategy. The agreement has been used as a model across the country for building relationships between police and local communities.[115]
On July 19, 2015, Samuel DuBose, an unarmed black motorist, was fatally shot by white University of Cincinnati Police Officer, Ray Tensing after a routine traffic stop for a missing front license plate. The resulting legal proceedings in late 2016[116] have been a recurring focus of national news media.[117] Several peaceful protests involving the Black Lives Matter movement have been carried out.[118][119] Tensing was indicted on charges of murder and voluntary manslaughter, but a November 2016 trial ended in mistrial[120] after the jury became deadlocked. A retrial began in May 2017, which also ended in mistrial after deadlock. The prosecution then announced they did not plan to try Tensing a third time.[121] The University of Cincinnati has settled with the DuBose family for $4.8 million[122] and free tuition for each of the 12 children.
Present officeholders[edit]
The present Mayor of Cincinnati is John Cranley. The nine-member city council is composed of Vice Mayor David Mann and Councilmembers Yvette Simpson (President Pro-Tem), Kevin Flynn, Amy Murray, Chris Seelbach, P.G. Sittenfeld, Christopher Smitherman, Charlie Winburn, and Wendell Young.[123] The city manager is Harry Black, and the manager maintains two assistant city managers.

Walnut Hills offers 28 Advanced Placement courses. Cincinnati is also home to the first Kindergarten – 12th grade Arts School in the country, the School for Creative and Performing Arts. Cincinnati State is a small college that includes the Midwest Culinary School. Also located in Cincinnati is Cincinnati Christian University. Five hundred years since the Reformation Cincinnati provided a global distinguished lecture marking the layout of books and research for stirred citygoers[128] and the Cincinnati Art Museum staff built Albrecht Durer: The Age of Reformation and Renaissance, [129] with more crafting by the University design, art, and architecture program given for the City.[130] Most of the work explores social ontology of the birth of mainline beliefs and propriety, woven with scripture and pamphlets which launched a widespread European grooming.
The Jewish community has several schools, including the all-girl RITSS (Regional Institute for Torah and Secular Studies) high school,[131] and the all-boy Yeshivas Lubavitch High School.[132] Hebrew Union College- Jewish Institute of Religion (HUC-JIR), founded by Isaac Mayer Wise, is a seminary for training of Reform rabbis and others religious.[133]
Xavier University, one of two Roman Catholic colleges along with Chatfield College, was at one time affiliated with The Athenaeum of Ohio, the seminary of the Cincinnati Archdiocese.

A transit map of Greater Cincinnati.


A system of public staircases known as the Steps of Cincinnati guides pedestrians up and down the many hills in the city. In addition to practical use linking hillside neighborhoods, the 400 stairways provide visitors scenic views of the Cincinnati area.[144]
Commuters and travelers know light rail has long been a goal in Cincinnati, designs changing over many decades. The city grew rapidly during the streetcar era of the 1800s and early 1900s. Public transit ridership has been in decline for at least several decades and bicycles and walking account for a relatively small portion of all trips. Like many other midwestern cities, however, bicycle use is growing fairly rapidly in the 2000s and 2010s.[145] In 1916 the Mayor and citizens voted to spend $6 million to build the Cincinnati Subway. The subway was planned to be a 16-mile loop from Downtown to Norwood to Oakley and back to the east side of Downtown. World War I delayed the construction in 1920 and inflation raised the costs causing the Oakley portion never to be built. Mayor Seasongood who took office later on argued it would cost too much money to finish the system.[citation needed] A century later, the Cincinnati Bell Connector streetcar line, which opened for service on September 9, 2016,[67][68] crosses directly above the unfinished subway on Central Parkway downtown.[146][147] Cincinnati is served by Amtrak's Cardinal, an intercity passenger train which makes three weekly trips in each direction between Chicago and New York City through Cincinnati Union Terminal. Cincinnati is served by the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA), the Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky (TANK) and the Clermont Transportation Connection. SORTA and TANK primarily operate 40-foot diesel buses, though some lines are served by longer articulated or hybrid-engine buses. In 2012–16, Cincinnati constructed a streetcar line in Downtown and Over-the-Rhine. This modern version of the streetcar opened in September 2016.[67] The Cincinnati Streetcar project experienced railcar-manufacturing delays and initial funding issues, but was completed on-time and within its budget in mid-2016.[148][149][150]




Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal houses several important museums, like the CRRC Museum of Railroadiana & Photographs.


The city is served by Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (IATA: CVG) which is actually located in Hebron, Kentucky. The airport is a hub for major passenger airline Delta Air Lines, as well as a focus city for low cost carriers Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines. In addition, the airport is the largest global hub for both Amazon Prime Air and DHL Aviation.[151][152] Cincinnati Municipal Lunken Airport (IATA: LUK), has daily service on commercial charter flights, and is located in Ohio. The airport serves as hub for Ultimate Air Shuttle and Flamingo Air.
Bus traffic is heavy in Cincinnati. Megabus and Greyhound as well as several other, smaller motor coach companies operate out of Cincinnati, making trips within the midwest or beyond. The city has an outer-belt, Interstate 275 (which is the longest circle highway in the country at 85 miles) and a spur, Interstate 471, to Kentucky. It is also served by Interstate 71, Interstate 74, Interstate 75 and numerous U.S. highways: US 22, US 25, US 27, US 42, US 50, US 52, and US 127. The Riverfront Transit Center, built under 2nd Street, is about the size of eight football fields. It is only used for sports games and school field trips. When it was built, it was designed for public transit buses, charter buses, school buses, city coach buses, light rail, and possibly commuter rail. On days it is not in use for sports games, it is closed off and rented to a private parking vendor.[153][154][155]
