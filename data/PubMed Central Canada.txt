PubMed Central Canada (PMC Canada) is a Canadian national digital repository of peer-reviewed health and life sciences literature.[1] It joins Europe PubMed Central (formerly UK PubMed Central) as a member of the PubMed Central International network.[2] PMC Canada is a partnership between the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (NRC-CISTI, the Canadian National Science Library), and the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM).[3]
PMC Canada includes an interface in both English and French, to support the use of Canada's two official languages. PubMed Central Canada provides free access to content, and is one of the locations where CIHR researchers can deposit their peer-reviewed research articles, in order to meet with the open access requirements of the CIHR Policy on Access to Research Outputs.[4]
