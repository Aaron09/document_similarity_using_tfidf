Scopus is Elsevier’s abstract and citation database launched in 2004. In 2009, the Content Selection and Advisory Board (CSAB) was formed to develop an objective system of evaluation and validation of peer-reviewed journals for inclusion or exclusion in Scopus against transparent and fair criteria. It[clarification needed] covers nearly 36,377 titles (22,794 active titles and 13,583 Inactive titles) from approximately 11,678 publishers, of which 34,346 are peer-reviewed journals in top-level subject fields Life Sciences, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences and Health Sciences. It covers three types of sources: Book Series, Journals, and Trade Journals. All journals covered in the Scopus database, regardless of who they are published under, are reviewed each year to ensure high-quality standards are maintained. Searches in Scopus also incorporate searches of patent databases.[1] It[clarification needed] gives four types of quality measure for each title, those are h-Index, CiteScore, SJR (SCImago Journal Rank) and SNIP (Source Normalized Impact per Paper). Anyone can find all titles[clarification needed] on the SCImago Journal Rank website.[2] According to the Scimago Journal Rankings, Nature has the highest h-index (1011 as of 2016), and CA - A Cancer Journal for Clinicians[3] has the highest SJR (39.285 as of 2016) and CiteScore 2016 (89.23 in the 99th percentile). Scimagojr.com used to give country ranking based on Total Published Documents, Citable documents, Citations, Self-Citations, Citations per Document and h-index.[citation needed] As per this website USA (h-index : 1965) is in first place, UK (h-index : 1213) is in the second place and Germany (h-index : 1059) is in third place based on national h-index.[citation needed]

Overview[edit]
Since Elsevier is the owner of Scopus and is also one of the main international publishers of scientific journals, an independent and international Scopus Content Selection and Advisory Board was established to prevent a potential conflict of interest in the choice of journals to be included in the database and to maintain an open and transparent content coverage policy, regardless of publisher.[4] The board consists of scientists and subject librarians.
Evaluating ease of use and coverage of Scopus and the Web of Science (WOS), a 2006 study concluded that "Scopus is easy to navigate, even for the novice user. ... The ability to search both forward and backward from a particular citation would be very helpful to the researcher. The multidisciplinary aspect allows the researcher to easily search outside of his discipline" and "One advantage of WOS over Scopus is the depth of coverage, with the full WOS database going back to 1945 and Scopus going back to 1966. However, Scopus and WOS complement each other as neither resource is all inclusive."[5]
Scopus also offers author profiles which cover affiliations, number of publications and their bibliographic data, references, and details on the number of citations each published document has received. It has alerting features that allows registered users to track changes to a profile and a facility to calculate authors' h-index. In 2016, a free website, Scopus CiteScore,[6] was introduced. It provides citation data for all 22,500 active titles such as journals, conference proceedings and books in Scopus and provides an alternative to the impact factor.
Scopus IDs for individual authors can be integrated with the non-proprietary digital identifier ORCID.[7]
Advantages by inclusion in Scopus[edit]

Gain international visibility
Increase the opportunity for collaboration with other researchers from around the world
Increase the possibility of the article content having additional citations due to the enhanced accessibility
Be contributing to the wider scholarly community in the specialist subject field


Guidelines from Scopus to Publishers & Editors for Journal Selection Process[edit]
[promotion?]
Scopus journal selection criteria is a 2‐stage process[edit]

Pre‐submission and self‐evaluation
Scopus Title Evaluation Process

Submission Process
Review Decisions by the CSAB



Self Evaluation Check List[edit]
� Does the journal have a publication history of at least two years?
� Does the journal publish peer‐reviewed content ?
� Does the journal have an ISSN registered at the International ISSN Centre?
� Do the articles published in the journal have English language abstracts and English language titles?
� Are the cited references listed in the articles provided in Roman script?
� Is there an online publication ethics and publication malpractice statement available for the journal?
� Check that the title of the journal is unique and descriptive and is not already been used by other journals.
� Have the three most recent journal issues or 9 articles plus a table of contents ready for uploading as sample documents in PDF format.
� Determine who is the main handling Editor of the journal. This is the person who is overall responsible for the peer‐review process and managing the journal. If there is more than one main handling editor, you can nominate up to three main handling editors.
� Have a URL for online professional information of the main handling editor(s). For example, curriculum vitae/resume, institutional or personal homepage, preferably showing scientific credibility, current affiliation and affiliation history, awards and grants received.
h-index[edit]
An h‐index of X means that Np papers have at least X citations each, and the other (Np ‐ X) papers have at most X citations each. Most frequently the h‐index is used to measure scientific output of an author, but the h-index can also be calculated for an institution, country or journal.
What are the main areas considered by the Scopus CSAB review process?[edit]

What should the website information include?[edit]

Information about the Editor / Editor in Chief and the structure and names of the Editorial Boards and/or International Advisory Board members.
Author guidelines explaining the manuscript submission process and criteria.
Information on how the peer‐review process is organized.
Publishing ethics guidelines. The publishing ethics guidelines should make it clear what action the Editor or Editorial Board will take if any malpractice is suspected.
Clear information about criteria and costs of Open Access options.
Information about how potential readers can get access to the full‐text articles published in the journal.
Information about the role and organization of the publisher of the journal.

How important is it to keep the website updated?[edit]
Up‐to‐date information on the journal website is very important as it demonstrates clearly an ongoing commitment to the development and sustainability of the journal. If a journal can be seen to have a reducing number of articles over time, or major time gaps between one issue and the other then this raises questions of whether that journal is receiving enough articles (copy flow) to sustain itself. One of the most important issues is to ensure that all links on the website are working and also that any links created function appropriately and have the most up to date information. Editors need to ensure that all information related to Editorial Board members, office contacts and publishers are accurate in order to ensure it is not misrepresenting itself.
What are the main decisions made by the Scopus CSAB?[edit]

In the Scopus title evaluation process, the reviewers of the CSAB decide if a journal will be selected for Scopus coverage (accepted) or not (rejected or deferred).
Decisions made by the CSAB Subject Chairs are final and will be accompanied with reviewer comments to support the decision. In case of rejection, an end date will be given after when the title may be suggested for Scopus review again (the re‐submission date).
In case of rejection, a conditional embargo date will be given after which the journal title may be suggested for Scopus review again. The embargo period can range from 1 year, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years to 5 years.

How does the Scopus CSAB decide on how long to wait before re‐submitting a journal?[edit]
The embargo period can range from 1 year, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years to 5 years and is dependent on how long the reviewers think it may take before the evaluation feedback can be addressed and take effect. Feedback is normally given as an overall comment, together with positive comments on key areas with more constructive comments on areas for improvement, all in keeping with the key assessment areas of inclusion in Scopus.
How long does the journal stay in the Scopus database?[edit]
Once a journal is selected for Scopus it will be covered from the year of selection onwards. Journals that are selected for Scopus within the third publication year will be covered from the first publication year onwards. If complete journal archives are available in digital format, the publisher may request to add back files to Scopus. Journals selected for Scopus will be covered in the database on a continuous basis; however, the performance of journals included in Scopus is being evaluated and poor performing journals may be discontinued. Scopus reserves the right to re‐evaluate and remove journals as it sees fit and journals with a proven case of publication malpractice will be cancelled for Scopus coverage and removed from the database.
