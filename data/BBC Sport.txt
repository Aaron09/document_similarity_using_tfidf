History[edit]
The BBC has broadcast sport for several decades under individual programme names and coverage titles. Grandstand was one of the more notable Sport programmes, broadcasting sport since the programmes launch in 1958. The BBC first began to brand sport coverage as 'BBC Sport' in 1988 for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, by introducing the programme with a short animation of a globe circumnavigated by four coloured rings.[2] This practice continued throughout the next two decades. Upon the launch of the BBC News website in 1997, sport was included in the BBC's online presence for the first time.
In May 2007, the BBC Trust approved plans for several BBC departments, including BBC Sport, to be moved to a new development in Salford.[3] The new development at MediaCityUK marks a major decentralisation of BBC departments from London and a key investment in the north of England where BBC spending in the region had previously been low. The department moved into Quay House, MediaCityUK gradually in late 2011 and early 2012 with the first Sports bulletins being broadcast from the new BBC Sport Centre on 5 March 2012.[4]
In 2017, BBC Sport launched a new on-air identity, becoming the first BBC property to implement the broadcaster's new corporate typeface.[5][6]
Summary of programming[edit]

Pundits for Match of the Day include Alan Shearer, Danny Murphy, Jermaine Jenas, Martin Keown and Ian Wright while commentators include Guy Mowbray, Steve Wilson, Jonathan Pearce, Simon Brotherton, Steve Bower, John Motson and Alistair Mann. The BBC also broadcasts live coverage of the FA Cup and will do so until 2021.[7]
Tennis[edit]
BBC Sport currently holds the rights to broadcast the Wimbledon Tennis Championships and the Queen's Club Championships live on its television platforms. The Wimbledon contract has been held by the BBC since 1927 and the current contract lasts until 2024 making it the longest such contract in the world.

Highlights are also shown on the long-running Today at Wimbledon, presented by Clare Balding, who replaced John Inverdale in 2015.

The BBC has exclusive free to air TV rights for 8 singles matches from the ATP World Tour Finals which includes the semi final and the final. The BBC have covered the event originally between 2009 and 2011, followed by an extension for 2012 and 2013. This was extended again in 2013 through to 2015. It was extended again in 2016 for another 2 years before another deal was announced in 2017 and will run until 2020.[11][12][13][14] with Sky Sports, showing one afternoon match per day including one semi-final and the final which are usually shown on BBC Two.

Olympics[edit]




The BBC One and BBC Three 2012 Summer Olympics studios at the Olympic Park


The BBC holds the exclusive terrestrial rights to show Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games and has shown live coverage of every Summer Olympics since 1960. For the 2012 Olympics in London the BBC had three stations showing live coverage of the games. BBC One showed main coverage BBC Three with special extended coverage and BBC Two would broadcast coverage when BBC One was broadcasting news bulletins.
The BBC's current rights deal lasts through the 2020 Summer Olympics. Beginning at the 2018 Winter Olympics, the BBC will enter into sub-licensing agreements with Discovery Communications, the pan-European rightsholder of the Olympics for 2018 through 2024. Discovery will sub-license exclusive pay television rights to the Games from the BBC in 2018 and 2020, and will then, in turn, sub-license terrestrial rights to the Games to the BBC in 2022 and 2024. The deal is intended to maintain the BBC's tradition of Olympic broadcasting, although the BBC's coverage will be reduced as a result; the BBC and Discovery have had a historic relationship in regards to co-production of factual and nature programming.[17]
Commonwealth Games[edit]
The BBC showed the 2014 Commonwealth Games with more coverage than ever before. Coverage was similar to their coverage of the 2012 London Olympics. Live coverage was shown from 9.00 am to 10.30 pm on BBC One with coverage switching to BBC Two during news bulletins (1.00 pm to 1.45 pm, 6.00 pm to 7.00 pm and 10.00 pm to 10.30 pm). BBC Three broadcast alternative coverage from 9.00 am to 10.00 pm. .
Athletics[edit]
The BBC covers events such as the Commonwealth Games, the European Athletics Championships, domestic British athletics and mass-participation events such as the London Marathon and the Great North Run. The BBC have the rights to show coverage of each Diamond League meeting on the red button, with the two British rounds and final two meetings live on BBC Two and selected meetings on BBC Three. In July 2013, The BBC announced that they had extended their deal to broadcast British athletic events such as the British Championships/World or European Championship Trials and the upcoming Anniversary Games through to 2020.[18] The BBC lost the rights to the 2011 and 2013 World Championships to Channel 4. However, in November 2011 it was announced that the BBC has obtained the TV, radio and online rights to the 2015 and 2017 IAAF World Athletics events,[19] It was also announced Channel 4 decided to hand the rights to the 2013 Championships to the BBC. This was down to Channel 4 saying they wanted to focus on Paralympic Sports. The BBC athletics team consists of Gabby Logan, Ore Oduba, Colin Jackson, Steve Cram, Denise Lewis, Toni Minichiello, Andrew Cotter, Michael Johnson, Paula Radcliffe and Steve Backley.
Jessica Ennis-Hill provided commentary and analysis across track and field events at the 2017 IAAF World Championships alongside the regular presenting team.
Golf[edit]
The BBC holds joint rights to live coverage of one of the four men's major golf championships, the US Masters, covering Saturday and Sunday's play live and broadcasting highlights of Thursday and Friday's play. Sky Sports shows all four days of The Masters live. From 2017 they also show all four days of the US PGA Championship live.[20] Until 2015, the BBC's coverage of The Open Championships was extensive with coverage broadcast live and uninterrupted on BBC Two between 9 am and 8 pm on Thursday and Friday and on BBC One on Saturday and Sunday. Since 2016, Sky Sports has exclusive UK rights to The Open with the BBC showing a 2-hour highlights programme every night instead of live coverage.[21] The BBC also shows highlights of two other European Tour events held in Britain - the BMW PGA Championship and the Scottish Open. It also covers the Women's British Open. Eilidh Barbour is the lead presenter with commentary from Peter Alliss, Ken Brown, Andrew Cotter, Paul Azinger, Maureen Madill and Wayne Grady. Rishi Persad is the reporter.
Snooker[edit]
The 1960s BBC Two programme Pot Black was arguably the reason for the sport's great popularity over the last 40 years. Snooker produced the largest ever audience for BBC Two with the 1985 World Snooker Championship final between Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor pulling in 18.5 million viewers just after midnight and the sport always pulls in large viewing figures for the BBC. The BBC currently shows the World Snooker Championships, the Masters and the UK Championship on BBC Two. The BBC also broadcasts the Welsh Open and this is shown on the BBC Red Button and on BBC Two Wales.
The coverage is regularly hosted by Hazel Irvine or Jason Mohammad and the pundits are often Steve Davis and John Parrott. The commentary team mainly consists of former champions of the sport, such as Ken Doherty, Dennis Taylor, John Virgo and Stephen Hendry. Other commentators are used for longer tournaments such as Willie Thorne and Terry Griffiths. During the World Championships, guest commentators have featured, such as Peter Ebdon and George Riley, though Riley has only appeared as a commentator on an occasional basis (usually the lack of other commentators).
Darts[edit]
In February 2016, it was announced that the BBC would cover the inaugural PDC Champions League of Darts. As a consequence the BBC will no longer show the BDO World Darts Championships, a tournament that the BBC had shown this since its inception in 1978.[22]
Darts presenters on the BBC have included David Vine in 1978 Peter Purves from 1979 to 1984, Tony Gubba from 1985 to 1990, Eamonn Holmes from 1991 to 1993, Dougie Donnelly from 1994 to 1998, John Inverdale from 1999 to 2000, Ray Stubbs from 2001 to 2009, Colin Murray & Rob Walker from 2010 to 2016 and Jason Mohammad from 2016 to present. Bobby George has presented as well from 2000 to 2016. The current commentators are Vassos Alexander (2011–present), Dan Dawson (2016–present), Alan Warriner-Little (2016–present), Paul Nicholson (2016–present) and Mark Webster (2016–present). Former commentators are Sid Waddell 1978–1994, David Croft 2003–2012, John Part 1995–2007, Tony Green 1978–2010 and 2012–2016, Jim Proudfoot 2013–2016, Scott Mitchell 2014–2016 and John Rawling 2014–2016.
American football[edit]
On 9 September 2015, the BBC announced that the NFL would return to its screens in a 2-year deal that includes the rights to show the NFL International Series Games from London live with the first match being exclusively live and a weekly highlights show on the BBC Red Button & BBC Two which started in November and live television, radio and online rights to screen the Super Bowl alongside Sky Sports.[23] The London Games were presented by Nat Coombs, Mike Carlson and Osi Umenyiora with Ore Oduba as sideline reporter. The new BBC highlights show is presented by Mark Chapman alongside Osi Umenyiora and Jason Bell. Both the live coverage and highlights use coverage and commentators from American TV.
The BBC previously held the rights to live coverage, highlights (primarily broadcast on its web site) and live radio coverage of the NFL from 2007 to 2013 .[24] Jake Humphrey presented their play-off highlights show for the first 2 years with Matt Roberts taking over duties in 2010. The studio pundits included Mike Carlson, Rod Woodson and Jerry Rice. Since 2012 the BBC aired live weekly radio coverage of the NFL on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra and air the Super Bowl on BBC TV and BBC Radio 5 Live in 2012 but Jake Humphrey stepped down and was replaced by Mark Chapman. For the 2012–13 season, the BBC broadcast Monday Night Football on the iPlayer and via BBC HD (commencing with the Giants at Redskins game on 4 December 2012; prior to this the broadcast was only available through the Red Button or online). Channel 4 then took over as the terrestrial home of NFL on British TV showing a Sunday Night game, the two London games and their first Super Bowl in 16 years in 2014 after last covering the Super Bowl in 1998. Absolute Radio took over the BBC Radio rights.
Other sports[edit]
As well as all of this, the BBC broadcasts winter sports, including the Alpine Skiing World Cup, under its Ski Sunday banner; and briefly covers sports such as road and track cycling, sailing, badminton, table tennis, squash, equestrianism, gymnastics and other minority sports. Presenters for these sports include Jill Douglas and Phil Jones who often report for other areas of BBC Sport.
BBC Sport regained coverage of the Boat Race from ITV Sport who pulled out of coverage after the 2009 event. A five-year contract was signed by BBC Sport to cover the event from 2010 after last covering the 2004 race. Clare Balding hosts this and commentary came from Andrew Cotter from 2010 to 2011, 2013–present and from Jonathan Legard in 2012. The race is also broadcast on BBC World News. Former presenters for this were Harry Carpenter who also commentated and Steve Rider while Barry Davies also commentated on this from the 1990s to 2004.
BBC Sport also holds the rights to the Invictus Games which is presented by Clare Balding, Ade Adepitan, Johnathan Edwards.
The BBC also has rights to highlights of Equestrianism from Badminton Horse Trials and Burghley Horse Trials. The coverage is hosted by Clare Balding and if she is unavailable Rishi Persad hosts with commentary by Mike Tucker. The BBC also shows the World Indoor Bowls Championships. Currently this is presented by Richi Persad with commentary by David Corkill and analysis from current players such as Greg Harlow & Andy Thompson. Former bowls presenters include David Icke and Dougie Donnelly.

Radio sports rights[edit]
BBC Sport had monopolised the sports commentary market on British radio since the BBC's conception but since 2000, has lost coverage of some sporting events to competitors including TalkSPORT. The majority of BBC Sport's radio coverage is broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra however coverage is also broadcast on BBC Radio 4's longwave frequencies, BBC Local Radio and the BBC World Service. Highlights are also reported on the BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2 news bulletins. Although cricket is not covered on television, the sport is fully covered by the BBC on its radio platforms, primarily BBC Radio 5 Live, 5 Live Sports Extra but also on Local Radio and BBC Radio 4 Longwave. This commentary is repeated and expanded on the BBC Sports website and on the BBC Red Button, overlaid with live scorecards. While television coverage of the London 2012 Paralympic Games was held by Channel 4,[25] the BBC retained the radio rights to the event and plans to broadcast events on radio stations BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra.[26]
Previous coverage[edit]
Horse racing[edit]
Horse racing coverage on the BBC had declined in recent years and finished altogether at the end of 2012 when Channel 4 won the rights to the Grand National, Royal Ascot and the Epsom Derby.[27] The BBC had lost many tracks over the years such as the Cheltenham Festival and other Cheltenham meetings went to Channel 4 in 1995, meetings from Newbury moved to Channel 4 in 2002 and after 50 years Glorious Goodwood and other Goodwood meetings were lost to Channel 4 in 2007. Also, in 2007 the Irish Derby, which had been included in Grandstand and later Sunday Grandstand for decades, was only shown on At the Races.
The Grand National used to be one of the biggest attractions on Grandstand with audiences around or often in excess of 10 million for the race on a Saturday afternoon. Coverage of other events such as Royal Ascot and The Derby were also broadcast. The Derby was won back after many years in 2001, when the BBC also gained rights to The Oaks, which had only ever previously been shown by ITV and Channel 4 (until 2001, the commercial broadcasters had always held the Epsom contract, but from 1960 to 1974, in 1977 and in 1979 the BBC had shown the Derby simultaneously with ITV, because it was a protected event which could not be exclusive to either channel).
The most famous BBC TV racing broadcaster was Peter O'Sullevan, who became one of the first ever TV sports commentators in the immediate post-war years and stayed with the BBC until 1997. Julian Wilson had presented the BBC's horse racing coverage for more than 30 years and also retired in 1997. Clare Balding took over presenting duties following Wilson's retirement.
Cricket[edit]
Prior to 1999 the BBC had shown live cricket coverage for many decades. Coverage had been fronted by Peter West and later by Tony Lewis. Richie Benaud was a commentator for the BBC for more than 30 years. In 1999 the BBC lost coverage of England home matches to Channel 4. One of BBC Sport's major criticisms is that it no longer shows any live cricket games. The BBC was also criticised for subsequently not bidding for the rights to show home Test matches.
The BBC broadcast highlights of the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup, 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. These were hosted by Sonali Shah, Rishi Persad and Manish Bhasin. They also had highlights of the 2006–07 Ashes Series with Manish Bhasin. The BBC take the world feed for these tournaments which all broadcasters take including Sky Sports and this comprises commentators from broadcasters all over the world, examples of which are Nasser Hussain, Michael Atherton and David Lloyd from Sky Sports as well as Mark Nicholas and Michael Vaughan from Channel 5 / Channel 9.
Motorsport[edit]
The BBC covered the World Rally Championship until 2001, when Channel 4 bought the rights. WRC is now shown on ITV4. The BBC gave up the rights to the British Touring Car Championship at the end of 2001, with the rights eventually being picked up by ITV.
Formula One[edit]
The BBC covered Formula One from 1978 until 1996 and from 2009 to 2015. The BBC provided live coverage of all races from 2009 to 2011, but from 2012 to 2015 the BBC showed 10 races live each season and highlights of all the races including the ones shown live. The BBC always showed the British Grand Prix and the final race live. Coverage was presented by Jake Humphrey from 2009 to 2012 and Suzi Perry from 2013 to 2015, with David Coulthard, Eddie Jordan and Allan McNish providing analysis during the races. Lee McKenzie and Tom Clarkson acted as pitlane reporters. The main commentators were Jonathan Legard in 2009 and 2010, Martin Brundle in 2011 and Ben Edwards from 2012 to 2015. Brundle acted as co-commentator in 2009 and 2010 and David Coulthard from 2011 to 2015. James Allen, Allan McNish and Jack Nicholls provide radio coverage with Jennie Gow as pit reporter though they also appeared on BBC TV. McKenzie presented Inside F1 for BBC News. Murray Walker continues to contribute to coverage across the BBC as he has done for over sixty years and triple world champion and Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton has a blog on BBC's website.
Motorcycling[edit]
BBC Sport had coverage of the British and World Superbikes for a few years—often showing the World Championship version live. It lost the BSB rights to Premium TV at the end of 2001. Premium TV did not have a channel of its own, so sub-leased the rights first to the ITV Sport Channel, then British Eurosport. After acquiring the rights to the MotoGP World Championship in 2003 coverage of the World Superbikes was dropped.
In 2003 the BBC won the rights to the MotoGP World Championship. After a successful first season fronted by Suzi Perry, coverage was expanded with more live races and the contract was extended to the end of the 2013 season. The BBC showed all MotoGP races, with all qualifying sessions live via the BBC Red Button. From the 2009 season, more coverage became available on qualifying and race days again through the use of the Red Button service.[28] Jennie Gow replaced Perry for 2010,[29] but from 2011 former pitlane reporter Matt Roberts became host, alongside the original and unchanged commentary team of Charlie Cox and Steve Parrish.[30] Azi Farni replaced Roberts as pitlane reporter. From 2013 Qualifying moved from BBC Red Button to BBC Two. In May 2013 it was announced that the rights to MotoGP coverage had been awarded to BT Sport, in a five-year deal starting in 2014.[31] None of the BBC Team were recruited by BT Sport for the 2014 season.
However BBC Sport still gives comprehensive coverage of the Irish Road Racing Championship, the International North West 200 and the Ulster Grand Prix together with other Road Racing meetings within Ireland together with the Southern 100 Motorcycle Races on the Isle of Man. These programmes are produced by BBC Northern Ireland.[32]
Paralympic Games[edit]
The BBC had shown full coverage of the Paralympics since the 1980s with the amount of coverage increasing in the 2000s to include some live coverage of the 2008 Paralympic Games. The BBC lost the TV rights to the 2012 Paralympic Games to Channel 4 after they made a £10 million bid - the deal was later extended until the 2016 Games then 2020.
Darts[edit]
The BBC covered the BDO World Championships from its inception in 1978 until 2016. In February 2016, it was announced that the BBC would cover the inaugural Professional Darts Corporation-sanctioned Champions League of Darts and as a consequence, its 38-year association with the British Darts Organisation came to an end. The BBC also covered the BDO Winmau World Masters from 2001 to 2010 but this coverage was lost to ESPN.
Basketball[edit]
Future coverage[edit]
Cricket[edit]
On 30 June 2017 it was announced that live cricket would be returning to the BBC for the first time in 19 years. The BBC will regain rights to highlights of all England's home Tests, ODIs and T20s. They will also have live broadcasts of two home T20 matches, plus 10 matches from a new domestic T20 competition. Coverage also includes England Women for whom they will broadcast one home T20 and 8 matches from the new domestic T20 tournament from 2018

BBC Sport Online[edit]




BBC Sport website as it appeared in May 2012.


BBC Sport operates a sub-site of BBC Online which supplements the television and radio services of the department. The website features scores and analysis from a variety of sports including those not broadcast by the BBC. The site also includes news stories related to teams or particular sports and live broadcast coverage of some sports.
The website launched c. 2000 and was relaunched in 2003 to accommodate bigger screen sizes, with a sidebar to incorporate more sport and to parallel the relaunched BBC News website.[48] The current look was implemented in February 2012, featuring the bold colour scheme of the logo, the new horizontal navigation bar across the whole of the site and design characteristics being implemented across the BBC website. The new look gave more prominence to live sports, programmes and events as well as news on the individual teams.[49] In January 2013, the BBC Sport app was launched on the iOS app store. An Android version was launched in February that year.[50]
Sports forum[edit]
Until 2011, the BBC Sport website hosted an online sports forum entitled 606, named after the original start-time of the radio programme – six minutes past six. It covered a large variety of topics which included cricket, football, rugby (league and union), tennis, athletics, motorsport and many more. Sporting teams usually had their own individual pages where members could post and comment on any news or topics relating to that team. Users accessed through an account system and could comment and rate their opinions. The forum was moderated by the BBC and any posts deemed to have broken the 'house rules' was not posted.
As part of the reduction in BBC Online's budget of 25%, all non-essential services that did not focus around core products were closed. As all posts had to be post moderated and as conversations were increasingly being done through social media websites that BBC Sport were a part of, the site was closed on 31 May 2011.[51]
Interactive services[edit]




BBC Sports Personality of the Year trophy.


BBC Sport also offers a service on the BBC Red Button interactive television service. The service offers a sports multi-screen service covering sports news stories in addition to five streams that can broadcast sport through the red button. This is often used for uninterrupted coverage and scores over a commentary, or for an alternative sport event unable to be covered on the main BBC TV or radio services.[52] A key example is of the broadcasts of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships as matches on other courts may be displayed through the red button while a higher ranking match on a main court is taking place on the main TV service.[53]
Awards[edit]
See also: BBC Sports Personality of the Year, BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year, and BBC Sports Unsung Hero Award
BBC Sport also award several awards in recognition of the sports community. The mainstay of this is the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award, created in 1954 and awarded in a high-profile ceremony in December of each year.[54] There are several other awards given around the same time that focus on different areas of the sports industry, for example youth performers and coaches and trainers.[54]
The awards also include the BBC Nations and Regions, who often present awards at local ceremonies for similar reasons; the winners of these local awards are therefore frequently put forward for the national awards themselves allowing all areas of the country to be represented at the national awards.
