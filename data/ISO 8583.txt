ISO 8583 is an international standard for Financial transaction card originated interchange messaging. It is the International Organization for Standardization standard for systems that exchange electronic transactions initiated by cardholders using payment cards.
ISO 8583 defines a message format and a communication flow so that different systems can exchange these transaction requests and responses. The vast majority of transactions made when a customer uses a card to make a payment in a store (EFTPOS) use ISO 8583 at some point in the communication chain, as do transactions made at ATMs. In particular, both the MasterCard and Visa networks base their authorization communications on the ISO 8583 standard, as do many other institutions and networks.
Although ISO 8583 defines a common standard, it is not typically used directly by systems or networks. It defines many standard fields (data elements) which remain the same in all systems or networks, and leaves a few additional fields for passing network-specific details. These fields are used by each network to adapt the standard for its own use with custom fields and custom usages.

Introduction[edit]
The ISO 8583 specification has three parts:

Part 1: Messages, data elements,and code values[1]
Part 2: Application and registration procedures for Institution Identification Codes (IIC)[2]
Part 3: Maintenance procedures for the aforementioned messages, data elements and code values[3]

Message format[edit]
A card-based transaction typically travels from a transaction-acquiring device, such as a point-of-sale terminal or an automated teller machine (ATM), through a series of networks, to a card issuing system for authorization against the card holder's account. The transaction data contains information derived from the card (e.g., the account number), the terminal (e.g., the merchant number), the transaction (e.g., the amount), together with other data which may be generated dynamically or added by intervening systems. Based on this information, the card issuing system will either authorize or decline the transaction and generate a response message which must be delivered back to the terminal within a predefined time period.
An ISO 8583 message is made of the following parts:

Message type indicator (MTI)
One or more bitmaps, indicating which data elements are present
Data elements, the actual information fields of the message

The placements of fields in different versions of the standard varies; for example, the currency elements of the 1987 and 1993 versions of the standard are no longer used in the 2003 version, which holds currency as a sub-element of any financial amount element. As of June 2017, however ISO 8583:2003 has yet to achieve wide acceptance. ISO 8583 messaging has no routing information, so is sometimes used with a TPDU header.
Cardholder-originated transactions include purchase, withdrawal, deposit, refund, reversal, balance inquiry, payments and inter-account transfers. ISO 8583 also defines system-to-system messages for secure key exchanges, reconciliation of totals, and other administrative purposes.
Message Type Indicator (MTI)[edit]
The Message Type Indicator is a 4 digit numeric field which indicates the overall function of the message. A Message Type Indicator includes the ISO 8583 version, the Message Class, the Message Function and the Message Origin, as described below.
ISO 8583 version[edit]
The first digit of the MTI indicates the ISO 8583 version in which the message is encoded.
A value of 0 indicates the 1987 version of the standard, while 1 indicates ISO 8583:1993. Values 3 through 7 are reserved for ISO internal use, while 8 is reserved for national use and 9 is reserved for private use.
Example of MTI for ISO 8583 version:
0xxx - ISO 8583:1987
1xxx - ISO 8583:1993
2xxx - ISO 8583:2003
Message class[edit]
Position two of the MTI specifies the overall purpose of the message.


Position
Meaning
Usage


x0xx
Reserved by ISO



x1xx
Authorization message
Determine if funds are available, get an approval but do not post to account
for reconciliation, Dual Message System (DMS), awaits file exchange for posting to account



x2xx
Financial messages
Determine if funds are available, get an approval and post directly to the account,
Single Message System (SMS), no file exchange after this



x3xx
File Actions Message
Used for hot-card, TMS and other exchanges


x4xx
Reversal and Chargeback Messages
Reversal (x4x0 or x4x1): Reverses the action of a previous authorization.
Chargeback (x4x2 or x4x3): Charges back a previously cleared financial message.



x5xx
Reconciliation Message
Transmits settlement information message


x6xx
Administrative Message
Transmits administrative advice. Often used for failure messages (e.g. message reject or failure to apply)


x7xx
Fee Collection Messages



x8xx
Network Management Message
Used for secure key exchange, logon, echo test and other network functions


x9xx
Reserved by ISO



Message function[edit]
Position three of the MTI specifies the message function which defines how the message should flow within the system. Requests are end-to-end messages (e.g., from acquirer to issuer and back with time-outs and automatic reversals in place), while advices are point-to-point messages (e.g., from terminal to acquirer, from acquirer to network, from network to issuer, with transmission guaranteed over each link, but not necessarily immediately).


Position
Meaning


xx0x
Request


xx1x

xx5x
Notification Acknowledgement


xx6x

xx7x
Instruction Acknowledgement (ISO 8583:2003 only)


xx8x
Reserved for ISO use. (Some implementations use for Response acknowledgment)


xx9x
Reserved for ISO use. (Some implementations use for Negative acknowledgment)


Message origin[edit]
Position four of the MTI defines the location of the message source within the payment chain.


Position
Meaning


xxx0
Acquirer


xxx1
Acquirer Repeat


xxx2
Issuer


xxx3
Issuer Repeat


xxx4
Other


xxx5
Other Repeat


Examples[edit]
Given an MTI value of 0110, the following example lists what each:

  0xxx -> version of ISO 8583 (for example: 1987 version)
  x1xx -> class of the message (1 = authorization message)
  xx1x -> function of the message (1 = response)
  xxx0 -> who began the communication (0 = acquirer)

MTI 0110 is then an authorization response message sent by the acquirer.
Bearing each of the above four positions in mind, an MTI will completely specify what a message should do, and how it is to be transmitted around the network. Unfortunately, not all ISO 8583 implementations interpret the meaning of an MTI in the same way. However, a few MTIs are relatively standard:


MTI
Meaning
Usage


0100
Authorization Request
Request from a point-of-sale terminal for authorization for a cardholder purchase


0110
Request Response
Request response to a point-of-sale terminal for authorization for a cardholder purchase

Bitmaps[edit]
In ISO 8583, a bitmap is a field or subfield within a message, which indicates whether other data elements or data element subfields are present elsewhere in the message. A field is considered to be present only when the corresponding bit in the bitmap is set. For example, a byte with value 0x82 (decimal 130) is binary '1000 0010', which means fields 1 and 7 are present in the message and fields 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 are not.
The bitmap may be represented as 8 bytes of binary data, or as 16 hexadecimal characters 0-9, A-F in the ASCII or EBCDIC character sets. A message will contain at least one bitmap, called the Primary Bitmap, which indicates which of Data Elements 1 to 64 are present. The presence of an optional secondary bitmap is also indicated by bit 1 of the Primary Bitmap. If present, the secondary bitmap indicates whether data elements 65 to 128 are present. Similarly, a tertiary bitmap can be used to indicate the presence of fields 129 to 192, although these data elements are rarely used.
Examples[edit]
Given a bitmap value of "42 10 00 11 02 C0 48 04",
0x42 = 0100 0010 (counting from the left, the second and seventh bits are 1, indicating that fields 2 and 7 are present)
0x10 = 0001 0000 (the first bit corresponds to field 9, so the fourth bit here indicates field 12 is present)
0x00 = 0000 0000 (no fields present)
0x11 = 0001 0001 (fields 28 and 32 are present)
0x02 = 0000 0010 (field 39 is present)
0xC0 = 1100 0000 (fields 41 and 42 are present)
0x48 = 0100 1000 (fields 50 and 53 are present)
0x04 = 0000 0100 (field 62 is present)

0________10________20________30________40________50________60__64
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234  n-th bit
0100001000010000000000000001000100000010110000000100100000000100  bitmap

Therefore, the given bitmap defines the following fields present in the message:
2, 7, 12, 28, 32, 39, 41, 42, 50, 53, 62
Data elements[edit]
Data elements are the individual fields carrying the transaction information. There are up to 128 data elements specified in the original ISO 8583:1987 standard, and up to 192 data elements in later releases. The 1993 revision added new definitions, deleted some, while leaving the message format itself unchanged.
While each data element has a specified meaning and format, the standard also includes some general purpose data elements and system- or country-specific data elements which vary enormously in use and form from implementation to implementation.
Each data element is described in a standard format which defines the permitted content of the field (numeric, binary, etc.) and the field length (variable or fixed), according to the following table:


Abbreviation
Meaning


a
Alpha, including blanks


n
Numeric values only


s
Special characters only


an
Alphanumeric


as
Alpha & special characters only


ns
Numeric and special characters only


ans
Alphabetic, numeric and special characters.


b
Binary data


z
Tracks 2 and 3 code set as defined in ISO/IEC 7813 and ISO/IEC 4909 respectively


. or .. or ...
variable field length indicator, each . indicating a digit.


x or xx or xxx
fixed length of field or maximum length in the case of variable length fields.


Additionally, each field may be either fixed or variable length. If variable, the length of the field will be preceded by a length indicator.


Type
Meaning


Fixed
no field length used


LLVAR or (..xx)
Where 0 < LL < 100, means two leading digits LL specify the field length of field VAR


LLLVAR or (...xxx)
Where 0 < LLL < 1000, means three leading digits LLL specify the field length of field VAR


LL and LLL are hex or ASCII. A VAR field can be compressed or ASCII depending of the data element type.
LL can be 1 or 2 bytes. For example, if compressed as one hex byte, '27x means there are 27 VAR bytes to follow. If ASCII, the two bytes '32x, '37x mean there are 27 bytes to follow. 3 digit field length LLL uses 2 bytes with a leading '0' nibble if compressed, or 3 bytes if ASCII. The format of a VAR data element depends on the data element type. If numeric it will be compressed, e.g. 87456 will be represented by 3 hex bytes '087456x. If ASCII then one byte for each digit or character is used, e.g. '38x, '37x, '34x, '35x, '36x.
