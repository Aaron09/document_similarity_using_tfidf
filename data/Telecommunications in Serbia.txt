Fixed-line telephony[edit]
Serbia has a developed and efficient telephone network infrastructure. Domestic line system is 100% digital, with digital cable trunk line connecting switching centers. A drop in fixed-line connections in the last decade has been more than offset by a sharp increase in mobile-cellular telephone use. Telekom Srbija, the former state monopoly, is the predominant player in fixed-line telephony with 93.8% of market share.[4] Since the liberalization of the telecommunications market in 2013, Telekom Srbija has been very slowly losing market share to 16 other telecom operators, of which the most significant ones include Orion Telekom and SBB.
Mobile telephony[edit]
Serbia currently has three mobile networks, Telekom Srbija, Telenor, and Vip mobile, all of which are licensed for 2G GSM, 3G UMTS, and 4G LTE. The largest mobile operator is Telekom Srbija, marketed as mts, with 4.22  million subscribers, followed by Telenor with 2.96 million users and Vip mobile with 1.98 million.[5] In addition, SBB gained mobile virtual network operator licence in 2013 but is still not offering services.
