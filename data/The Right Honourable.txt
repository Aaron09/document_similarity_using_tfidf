The Right Honourable (The Rt Hon. or Rt Hon.) is an honorific style traditionally applied to certain persons and to certain collective bodies in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, India, some other Commonwealth realms, the Anglophone Caribbean, Mauritius, and occasionally elsewhere. "Right" in this context is an adverb meaning "to a great extent or degree".

Collective entities[edit]
"The Right Honourable" is added as a prefix to the name of various collective entities such as:

The Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal (of the United Kingdom, etc.) in Parliament Assembled (the House of Lords)
The Right Honourable the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses (of the House of Commons/Commons House) in Parliament Assembled[1] (the House of Commons) (archaic, now simply The Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom, etc.)[2]
The Right Honourable the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty (the former Board of Admiralty)
The Right Honourable the Lords of the Committee of the Privy Council appointed for the consideration of all matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations (the Board of Trade)

See also the collective use of "Most Honourable", as in "The Lords of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council" (the Privy Council).
Use of the honorific[edit]
The honorific is normally used only on the front of envelopes or other written documents.
In the House of Commons, Members of Parliament refer to members not as "the honourable member for ... (constituency)" but as "the right honourable member for ..." if they are Privy Councillors but now hold no ministry. To save having to recall constituency names in direct replies, the use of "the honourable lady/gentleman/member" or "the Minister (often, for department)/Chancellor/Prime Minister" is available to refer to members not in their own party (or coalition) where the person referred to has already spoken. Similarly, those in their own party are referred to as "my honourable friend" or, for Privy Councillors, "my right honourable friend". Other honorifics used in addition for those members in relevant professions (for example, "honourable and reverend",[3] "honourable and gallant"[4] and "honourable and learned"[5]) are also used in the Commons.[6]
Generally within the Commonwealth, ministers and judges are The Honourable unless they are appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, in which case they are The Right Honourable. Such persons generally include Prime Ministers and judges of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, and several other Commonwealth prime ministers. Provided they are Commonwealth citizens, foreign judges appointed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council are entitled to the honorific as well, although the appellation may be ignored in the judge's home country.
United Kingdom[edit]
The prefix is customarily abbreviated to "The" in many situations,[example needed] but never for Privy Counsellors.[7] The following persons are entitled to the style in a personal capacity:

Peers below the rank of marquess, namely earls,[8] viscounts,[9] and barons,[10] and their spouses. Peers who are dukes are styled "The Most Noble" or "His Grace" and marquesses are styled "The Most Honourable". If such latter peers holding either of the two highest titles in the peerage become Privy Counsellors, they retain their higher styles.
Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom[11][12]
Members of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland

The following persons are entitled to the style ex officio. The style is added to the name of the office, not the name of the person:

The Right Honourable Lord Mayor of London
The Right Honourable Lord Mayor of Cardiff
The Right Honourable Lord Mayor of Belfast
The Right Honourable Lord Mayor of York
The Right Honourable Lord Lyon King of Arms
The Right Honourable Lord Provost of Edinburgh
The Right Honourable Lord Provost of Glasgow

All other Lord Mayors are "The Right Worshipful"; other Lords Provost do not use an honorific. By the 1920s, a number of city mayors, including that of Leeds,[13] were unofficially using the prefix "The Right Honourable" and the matter was consequently raised in Parliament. The Lord Mayor of Bristol at present still uses the prefix "Right Honourable", without official sanction.[14][15] The Chairman of the London County Council (LCC) was granted the style in 1935 as part of the celebrations of the silver jubilee of King George V.[16] The Chairman of the Greater London Council, the body that replaced the LCC in 1965, was similarly granted the prefix,[17] but that body, and by extension the office of its chairman, was likewise abolished in 1986.
Privy Counsellors are appointed for life by the Monarch, on the advice of the Prime Minister. All members of the British Cabinet (technically a committee of the Privy Council) are appointed to the Privy Council, as are certain other senior ministers in the government and leaders of the major political parties. The Privy Council thus includes all current and former members of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, excepting those who have resigned from the Privy Council. The First Ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also so appointed.
In order to differentiate peers who are Privy Counsellors from those who are not, the suffix "PC" should be added after the name (according to Debrett's Peerage (2015)[18][19][20]). This is not however considered correct by Who's Who (2002).[21]
Australia[edit]
In Australia some Premiers of the Australian colonies in the 19th century were appointed members of HM Privy Council and were thus entitled to be called The Right Honourable. After federation in 1901, the Governor-General, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, the Prime Minister and some other senior ministers held the title.
In 1972 Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam declined appointment to the Privy Council. The practice was resumed by Malcolm Fraser in 1975, but Bob Hawke declined the appointment in 1983. The last Governor-General to be entitled to the style was Sir Ninian Stephen. The last politician to be entitled to the style was Ian Sinclair, who retired in 1998. In 2001, Sir Robert May was elevated to the UK peerage as Baron May of Oxford, which carries with it the style The Right Honourable.
Australians holding certain hereditary peerages in the grades of Baron, Viscount and Earl also use the Right Honourable title. The Lord Mayors of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,[22] Perth, Adelaide and Hobart are styled the Rt Hon. The style (which has no connection with the Privy Council) attaches to the title of Lord Mayor, not to their names, and is relinquished upon leaving office.

Canada[edit]
Further information: Canadian honorifics
In Canada, only occupants of the most senior public offices are styled as "The Right Honourable" (Le très honorable is the French term used by the federal government). Formerly, this was by virtue of their appointment to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. However, Canadian appointments to the British Privy Council were ended by the government of Lester Pearson. Since then, individuals who hold, or have held, one of the following offices are awarded the style of Right Honourable for life:

Governor General of Canada
Prime Minister of Canada
Chief Justice of Canada

The style may also be granted for life by the Governor General to eminent Canadians who have not held any of the offices that would otherwise entitle them to the style. It has been granted to the following individuals:

Paul Joseph James Martin (1992) — cabinet minister (Minister of External Affairs), Member of Parliament, Senator and diplomat
Martial Asselin (1992) — federal cabinet minister, Member of Parliament, Senator (Speaker of the Senate) and Lieutenant Governor of Quebec
Ellen Fairclough (1992) — federal cabinet minister and Member of Parliament; first woman in Canadian politics ever appointed to cabinet
Jean-Luc Pépin (1992) — federal cabinet minister and Member of Parliament; Chair of Anti-Inflation Board and Co-Chair of unity taskforce
Alvin Hamilton (1992) — federal cabinet minister and Member of Parliament
Don Mazankowski (1992) — Deputy Prime Minister, federal cabinet minister and Member of Parliament
Jack Pickersgill (1992) — federal cabinet minister, Member of Parliament, and senior civil servant (Assistant Private Secretary and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister, Clerk of the Privy Council; Chair of the Canadian Transport Commission)
Robert Stanfield (1992) —federal Opposition Leader and Member of Parliament, provincial MLA and Premier of Nova Scotia
Herb Gray (2002) — Deputy Prime Minister, federal cabinet minister, and Member of Parliament; the longest-serving MP in Canadian history

Governors General also use the style "His/Her Excellency" during their term of office. Members of the Privy Council and Senate receive the honorific "The Honourable". The style of Right Honourable does not apply to any official at the provincial level.
Before the style of Right Honourable came into use for all Canadian prime ministers, three prime ministers did not have the style as they were not members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom. These three were the Hon. Alexander Mackenzie, the Hon. Sir John Abbott and the Hon. Sir Mackenzie Bowell.
Over the years, a number of prominent Canadians became members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and thus were entitled to use the style of Right Honourable, either because of their services in Britain (e.g. serving as envoys to London) or as members of the Imperial War Cabinet, or due to their prominence in the Canadian Cabinet. These include:

Ireland[edit]
Members of the Privy Council of Ireland were entitled to be addressed as The Right Honourable, even after the Privy Council ceased to have any functions or to meet on the creation of the Irish Free State in December 1922. Nevertheless, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, like some of his counterparts in Great Britain, retained the use of the honorific style as a result of its having been conferred separately by legislation; in 2001 it was removed, as a consequence of local government law reform.
New Zealand[edit]
In New Zealand, the Prime Minister and some other senior cabinet ministers were customarily appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and thus styled The Right Honourable.[29]
In her resignation honours, the former prime minister Helen Clark did not recommend the appointment of any new Privy Councillors, and at present Winston Peters is the sole Privy Councillor in the New Zealand parliament. Privy Councillors recently retired from parliament include Clark, the former Speaker of the House Jonathan Hunt, and the former prime minister Jenny Shipley.[30] In 2009 it was announced that the new Prime Minister John Key had decided not to make any further recommendations to the Crown for appointments to the Privy Council.[31]
In August 2010, the Queen of New Zealand announced that, with immediate effect, individuals who hold, and those persons who after the date of the signing of these rules are appointed to, the following offices are awarded the style The Right Honourable for life:[29]

the Governor-General of New Zealand
the Prime Minister of New Zealand
the Chief Justice of New Zealand
the Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives

This change was made because the practice of appointing New Zealanders to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom had ceased. However, the change had little immediate effect, as all but two of the holders or living former holders of the offices granted the style had already been appointed to the Privy Council.[32] [33]
The living New Zealanders holding the style "The Right Honourable" as a result of membership of the Privy Council are:

Sir Geoffrey Winston Russell Palmer (1985)—prime minister
Sir (Johann) Thomas Eichelbaum (1989)—chief justice
Jonathan Lucas Hunt (1989)—cabinet minister
Sir Michael Hardie Boys (1989)—governor general
Helen Elizabeth Clark (1990)—prime minister
Michael Kenneth Moore (1990)—prime minister
James Brendan Bolger (1991)—prime minister
Sir Donald Charles McKinnon (1992)—deputy prime minister
Sir William Francis Birch (1992)—cabinet minister
Sir John Steele Henry (1996)—court of appeal justice
Sir Edmund Walter Thomas (1996)—supreme court justice
Dame Jenny Shipley (1998)—prime minister
Winston Peters (1998)—deputy prime minister
Sir Douglas Arthur Montrose Graham (1998)—cabinet minister
Paul Clayton East (1998)—cabinet minister
Sir Kenneth James Keith (1998)—court of appeal justice
Sir Peter Blanchard (1998)—supreme court justice
Sir Andrew Patrick Charles Tipping (1998)—supreme court justice
Wyatt Beetham Creech (1998)—deputy prime minister
Dame Sian Seerpoohi Elias (1999)—chief justice
Simon David Upton (1999)—cabinet minister
