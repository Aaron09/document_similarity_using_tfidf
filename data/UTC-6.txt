UTC−06:00 is a time offset that subtracts six hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In North America, it is observed in the Central Time Zone during standard time, and in the Mountain Time Zone during the other eight months (see Daylight saving time). Several Latin American countries and a few other places use it year round.
