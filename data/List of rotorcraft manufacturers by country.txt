Rotorcraft manufacturers fall into two categories:

those that can design, certify and manufacture new designs from scratch and
those that can only manufacture extant designs under license.

Boeing Vertol is an example of the first type and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, who license-produced Boeing Vertol designs for much of its recent history, is an example of the second.
This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries.
