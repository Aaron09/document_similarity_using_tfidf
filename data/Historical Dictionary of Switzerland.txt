The encyclopedia is being edited simultaneously in three national languages of Switzerland: German (Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz, HLS), French (Dictionnaire Historique de la Suisse, DHS) and Italian (Dizionario Storico della Svizzera, DSS). The first of 13 volumes was published in 2002. The last volume was published in 2014.
The 36,000 headings are grouped in:

Biographies (35%)
Articles on families and genealogy (10%)
Articles on places (municipalities, cantons, other nation states, fortresses, signories, abbeys, archeological sites) (30%)
Subject articles (historical phenomena and terms, institutions, events) (25%)

On-line edition[edit]
The on-line edition has been available since 1998. It makes accessible, for free, all articles ready for publication in print, but no illustrations. It also lists all 36,000 topics that are to be covered.
