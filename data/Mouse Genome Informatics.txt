Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) is a free, online database and bioinformatics resource hosted by The Jackson Laboratory, with funding by The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).[1] MGI provides access to data on the genetics, genomics and biology of the laboratory mouse to facilitate the study of human health and disease.[2][3] The database integrates multiple projects with the two largest contributions from the Mouse Genome Database and Gene Expression Database (GXD).[4]
The Mouse Genome Informatics resource[5] is a collection of data, tools, and analyses created and tailored for use in the laboratory mouse, a widely used model organism. It is "the authoritative source of official names for mouse genes, alleles, and strains", which follow the guidelines established by the International Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice.[6] The history and focus of The Jackson Laboratory research and production facilities generate tremendous knowledge and depth which researchers can mine to advance their research. A dedicated community of mouse researchers, worldwide enhances and contributes to the knowledge as well. This is an indispensable tool for any researcher using the mouse as a model organism for their research, and for researchers interested in genes that share homology with the mouse genes. Various mouse research support resources including animal collections and free colony management software are also available at the MGI site.[7]
