Operators[edit]
Golis Telecom Somalia[edit]
Bosaso is home to Golis Telecom Somalia, the largest telecommunications operator in northeastern Somalia. Founded in 2002 with the objective of supplying the country with GSM mobile services, fixed line and internet services, it has an extensive network that covers all of the nation's major cities and more than 40 districts in both Somaliland both Puntland.[1] According to The Economist, Golis offers one of the cheapest international calling rates on the planet, at $1.5USD less than anywhere else in the world.[citation needed]
SomCable[edit]
In 2010, SomCable Ltd announced that it was contracted to pull submarine cable from Djibouti port to Berbera. SomCable declared it would invest $35 million USD to complete the project which employed more than 10,000 locals workers. Funding for the project came from local businessman Mohamed Said MSG.[citation needed] The project will ensure that high speed wireless technology capable of delivering sufficient scalable bandwidth to residents of Somaliland is available at the site. The initiative is completed in September 2014. Somaliland is currently the only Fiber operator in the country. As of October 2014, Somcable Launched the first LTE solution in Somaliland, the first GEPON/ FTTP solution in Somaliland.
Somtel 2G[edit]
In 2008, Dahabshiil acquired a majority stake in Somtel, a Somaliland-based telecommunications firm specialising in Slow[Somtel], mobile Internet, and mobile phone services.[2][3] The acquisition provided Dahabshiil with the necessary platform for a subsequent expansion into mobile banking, a growth industry in the regional banking sector.[4][5]
Telesom[edit]
Telesom was established in 2001 to provide telecommunications services in the region.[6] Telesom currently controls 9% of Somaliland scribers, with the remaining 1% shared between the remaining operators.[clarification needed] The firm provides a variety of mobile communication products and services including prepaid call plans, monthly subscription plans, international roaming, SMS, WAP (over both GSM and GPRS), residential fixed line services, internet access as well as prepaid and postpaid 2G subscription services.[citation needed]
Regulation[edit]
On March 22, 2012, the Somali federal cabinet, which claims de jure sovereignty over Somaliland, unanimously approved the National Communications Act, which paves the way for the establishment of a National Communications regulator in the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors. The bill was passed following consultations between government representatives and communications, academic and civil society stakeholders. According to the Ministry of Information, Posts and Telecommunications, the Act is expected to create an environment conducive to investment and the certainty it provides will encourage further infrastructural development, resulting in more efficient service delivery.[7]
Satellite technology[edit]
Satellite technology is playing an instrumental role in Somaliland. Based on 2002 prices, a VSAT-based asymmetrical 128/64 connection in any given location in Somaliland costs $0.058 per minute. This assumes the connection is used 24 hours per day; seven days per week. The connection, and the associated costs, may be shared by several PCs to lower the “per minute charge” per PC.[citation needed] One tele-centre exampled in Somaliland showed the rate per PC to be $0.005 per minute.[citation needed]
