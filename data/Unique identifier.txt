Not to be confused with the many systems of unique identifiers, many of which have non-unique proper names such as Unique Identifier, UID, or Unique Identification Number.
With reference to a given (possibly implicit) set of objects, a unique identifier (UID) is any identifier which is guaranteed to be unique among all identifiers used for those objects and for a specific purpose.[1] There are three main types of unique identifiers, each corresponding to a different generation strategy:

serial numbers, assigned incrementally or sequentially
random numbers, selected from a number space much larger than the maximum (or expected) number of objects to be identified. Although not really unique, some identifiers of this type may be appropriate for identifying objects in many practical applications and are, with abuse of language, still referred to as "unique"
names or codes allocated by choice which are forced to be unique by keeping a central registry such as the EPC Information Services.

The above methods can be combined, hierarchically or singly, to create other generation schemes which guarantee uniqueness.[citation needed] In many cases, a single object may have more than one unique identifier, each of which identifies it for a different purpose. In relational databases, certain attributes of an entity that serve as unique identifiers are called primary keys.[citation needed][2]
