Western European Time (Northern Hemisphere winter only)[edit]
Main article: Western European Time
Principal cities: London, Casablanca, Dublin, Porto and Lisbon

Europe

Alderney
Canary Islands; observes European Union DST rules
Faroe Islands
Guernsey
Herm
 Ireland
Isle of Man
Jersey
 Portugal (with the exception of the Azores, which use UTC−01 with DST)
Sark
 United Kingdom (GMT)


Africa

 Morocco
Western Sahara



Notes:

The westernmost point where UTC with DST is applied is El Hierro, Canary Islands, Spain (18°00' W). Time used there is 2 hours and 12 minutes ahead of physical time in the summer, making for the greatest discrepancy in the UTC time zone.
The easternmost settlement where UTC with DST is applied is Lowestoft in Suffolk, East Anglia, England (at just 1°45' E).
Note that Ireland[1] uses the term "standard time"[2] in reference to the summer months and "winter time" during what the rest of the time zone calls "standard time". This is the reverse of the practice of most countries in the EU, but provides the same end results.

Antarctica[edit]

Notes[edit]

The westernmost point where UTC with no DST is applied is Bjargtangar, at the northwest peninsula of Iceland (24°32' W). Time used there is 1 hour and 38 minutes ahead of physical time. This is the greatest deviation from physical time for UTC with no DST.
The easternmost locale where UTC with no DST is applied is Bouvet Island, of Norwegian jurisdiction, at the South Atlantic Ocean (3°24' E).
