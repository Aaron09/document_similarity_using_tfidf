History[edit]
By a decree of 2000 Slovenia has been divided into 12 statistical regions (NUTS-3 level), which are grouped in two cohesion regions (NUTS-2 level).[1] which replace the historical regions of the country.
The statistical regions have been grouped into two cohesion regions are:

East Slovenia (Vzhodna Slovenija - SI01), which groups the Mura, Drava, Carinthia, Savinja, Central Sava, Lower Sava, Southeast Slovenia, and Littoral–Inner Carniola regions.
West Slovenia (Zahodna Slovenija - SI02), which groups the Central Slovenia, Upper Carniola, Gorizia, and Coastal–Karst regions.
