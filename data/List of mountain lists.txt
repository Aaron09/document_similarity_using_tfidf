For list of mountain lists not used in peak bagging, see Lists of mountains and Lists of mountains by region.
There are many notable mountain lists around the world. Typically, a list of mountains becomes notable by first being listed or defined by an author or group (e.g. Sir Hugh Munro defining the Munros in Scotland).[1] This list then becomes a popular target for peak bagging, where a number of people attempt to climb all of the peaks in the list.[2]
Alternatively, a list of mountains may become notable in the mountaineering community as a challenge. An example of such a challenge list is the Seven Summits defined by Richard Bass.[3]
Examples of notable lists of mountains are shown below.

Worldwide[edit]

The Eight-thousanders are the fourteen mountains over 8,000 metres (26,247 ft) in height, all in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges in Asia.
The Seven Summits are the highest peaks on each continent, from the Vinson Massif in Antarctica to Everest in Asia.
The Seven Second Summits are the second highest peaks on each continent. Climber and writer Jon Krakauer, survivor of the 1996 Everest Disaster, argues that a true climber would find more reward in ascending these largely more technical, demanding climbs.[original research?]
The Volcanic Seven Summits are the highest volcanoes on each of the seven continents, just as the Seven Summits are the highest peaks on each of the seven continents.
The Ultras are mountains worldwide that have a relative height of at least 1,500 metres (4,921 ft), regardless of location, absolute height or other merit.
The Snow Leopards are the five peaks of the former Soviet Union over 7,000 metres (22,966 ft) in height.

Europe[edit]

The Alpine four-thousanders are the 128 summits (82 'official summits' and 46 'lesser summits') of 4,000 metres (13,123 ft) or more in the Alps in France, Italy and Switzerland as defined by the UIAA.
The Six mountains of the Alps with the most difficult north faces.
The Pyrenean three-thousanders are the 129 summits of 3,000 metres (9,843 ft) or more in the Pyrenees in France and Spain as defined by a UIAA-sponsored joint Franco-Spanish team.

British Isles[edit]
Main article: Hill lists in the British Isles
The hills of Britain and Ireland are classified into a large number of lists for peak bagging purposes. Among the better-known lists are the following:

The Munros: a selection of mountains in Scotland over 3,000 feet (914.4 m). The list was originally compiled by Sir Hugh Munro.
The Furths: those mountains in Great Britain and Ireland, over 3,000 ft (914.4m) which would be Munros, but for their bad luck in being situated "furth" of Scotland.
The Corbetts: mountains in Scotland between 2,500 feet (762 m) and 3,000 feet (914 m), with a relative height of at least 500 feet (152.4 m).
The Marilyns: hills in the British Isles that have a relative height of at least 150 metres (492 ft), regardless of distance, absolute height or other merit. There are currently 1554 Marilyns in Britain and 453 Marilyns in Ireland.
The Wainwrights: the 214 fells in the English Lake District that have a chapter in one of Alfred Wainwright's Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells.
The Hewitts: hills in England, Wales or Ireland over two thousand feet (609.6 m) high with a relative height of at least 30 metres (98 ft).

North America[edit]

United States[edit]

The 67 fourteeners of the contiguous United States (peaks with at least 14,000 feet (4,267.2 m) of elevation and 300 feet (91.44 m) of topographic prominence), including:

the 53 Colorado fourteeners,
the 12 California fourteeners, and
Mount Rainier and Liberty Cap in the State of Washington.


The highest point in each of the 50 US states (ranging from 105.2 meters (345 ft) to 6,193.5 meters (20,320 ft) in elevation).
Several peakbagging sections of the Sierra Club's Angeles Chapter maintain lists of notable peaks, and organize outings to climb them.

The Sierra Peaks Section keeps a list of peaks in the Sierra Nevada, and a series of emblems (levels) for climbing a large number of them.[4]
The Desert Peaks Section climbs peaks in deserts of the Southwestern U.S. and Baja Mexico.[5]
The Hundred Peaks Section bags all the 277 peaks in Southern California over 5,000 feet (1,524.0 m).[6]
The Lower Peaks Committee keeps a list of peaks in Southern California shorter than 5,000 feet (1,524.0 m).[7]


The 46 highest peaks in New York's Adirondack Mountains (or rather, the list of 46 peaks once thought to be the highest. Successful completers are eligible for membership in the Adirondack Forty-Sixers)

Technically, there are more than forty 6,000 feet (1,828.8 m) mountains in the Southern Appalachians, but the list does not include mountains with peaks that have restricted access.
The East Beyond 6000 are similar to the Southern Sixers: all 41 peaks above 6,000 feet (1,828.8 m) east of the Mississippi. These include the 40 Southern Sixers, plus Mount Washington (New Hampshire).
