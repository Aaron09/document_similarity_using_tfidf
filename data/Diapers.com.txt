Diapers.com, founded in 2005 by Marc Lore and Vinit Bharara in Montclair, New Jersey, was an online specialty retailer for baby products.[citation needed] Initially founded as 1800DIAPERS, the company set out delivering consumables, such as diapers, wipes, and formula. It uses Kiva robots for warehouse automation and a combination of UPS Ground and FedEx delivery. In late 2008, Diapers.com expanded its selection into far-reaching baby categories, including clothes, car seats, strollers, and toys.[1]
Diapers.com was ranked #35 overall, #1 for Retail, #3 in NY-NJ-PA, and #5 Top Indian Run Companies by Inc. magazine in 2009.[2]
The company's headquarters are located at Exchange Place in Jersey City, New Jersey.[3]
In March 2017, Amazon.com announced their intention to shut down Diapers.com and all other Quidsi sites on April 19, 2017,[4] due to the businesses being unprofitable.[5] On April 20, 2017, Diapers.com, Soap.com, Wag.com, BeautyBar.com, Casa.com, and YoYo.com were relocated to new sites located on Amazon.com which can be accessed by their former URL. Quidsi.com redirects to Amazon.com.
History[edit]
In 2005, best friends Marc and Vinit started Diapers.com[6] with a simple idea—to make life easier for new parents. There was one huge obstacle: most major manufacturers would not sell their products to a startup. So, using their personal credit cards, they rented trucks and headed to wholesale stores up and down the Eastern Seaboard to buy diapers, wipes and formula in bulk.
Marc and Vinit opened a formal office in Montclair, New Jersey, in 2006, and the following year hired their first full-time employee. By 2009, the company was renamed Quidsi (meaning "what if" in Latin) to serve as an umbrella for all its sites. Quidsi added Soap.com for health, beauty and household essentials; BeautyBar.com, a luxury beauty destination; Wag.com, a pet specialty site; YoYo.com for toys and games; Casa.com for décor and home products; VineMarket.com for natural and organic groceries; AfterSchool.com for kids' sports and activities; Bookworm.com for children's books; and Look.com for kids' clothing. The 10 sites offered a shared shopping cart and checkout. As of 2016, only six of the 10 aforementioned sites appear in the main navigation and on the Quidsi.com corporate site.[3]
Amazon.com acquired Quidsi, Inc., which operates Diapers.com and Soap.com, for $545 million on November 8, 2010.[7] However, it continued to operate independently and follow an integration model similar to the one Amazon uses with Zappos.com until April 2017.
