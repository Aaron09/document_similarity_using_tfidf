History[edit]
JR East was incorporated on 1 April 1987 after being spun off from the government-run Japanese National Railways (JNR). The spin-off was nominally "privatization", as the company was actually a wholly owned subsidiary of the government-owned JNR Settlement Corporation for several years, and was not completely sold to the public until 2002.
Following the breakup, JR East ran the operations on former JNR lines in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Tohoku region, and surrounding areas.
Lines[edit]
Railway lines of JR East primarily serve the Kanto and Tohoku regions, along with adjacent areas in Koshin'etsu region (Niigata, Nagano, Yamanashi) and Shizuoka prefectures.
Shinkansen[edit]
JR East operates all of the Shinkansen, high-speed rail lines, north of Tokyo.

Tohoku Shinkansen (Tokyo - Shin-Aomori)
Joetsu Shinkansen (Tokyo - Niigata; Echigo-Yuzawa - Gala Yuzawa)
Hokuriku Shinkansen (Tokyo - Kanazawa)
Yamagata Shinkansen (Tokyo - Shinjo)
Akita Shinkansen (Tokyo - Akita)

The Tokyo–Osaka Tokaido Shinkansen is owned and operated by the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), although it stops at several JR East stations.
Kanto regional lines[edit]
Greater Tokyo Area[edit]
These lines have sections inside the Tokyo Suburban Area (東京近郊区間) designated by JR East. This does not necessarily mean that the lines are fully inside the Greater Tokyo Area.

Sponsorship[edit]
JR East co-sponsors the JEF United Ichihara Chiba J-League soccer club[citation needed], which was formed by a merger between JR East and Furukawa Electric company teams.
Environmental issues[edit]
JR East aims to reduce its carbon emissions by half, as measured over the period 1990-2030. This would be achieved by increasing the efficiency of trains and company-owned thermal power stations and by developing hybrid trains.[12]
Union issues[edit]
The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has stated that JR East's official union is a front for an organized crime syndicate called the Japan Revolutionary Communist League (Revolutionary Marxist Faction). An investigation of this is ongoing.[13]
East Japan Railway Culture Foundation[edit]
The East Japan Railway Culture Foundation is a non-profit organization established by JR East for the purpose of developing a "richer railway culture".[14] The Railway Museum in Saitama is operated by the foundation.
Bids outside Japan[edit]
EJRC holds a 15% shareholding in West Midlands Trains with Abellio and Mitsui that commenced operating the West Midlands franchise in England in December 2017.[15][16] The same consortium has also been listed to bid for the South Eastern franchise.[17][18]
