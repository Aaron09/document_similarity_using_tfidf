Sears, Roebuck and Company, colloquially known as Sears, is an American chain of department stores founded by Richard Warren Sears and Alvah Curtis Roebuck in 1892 and 1906. Formerly based at the Sears Tower in Chicago and currently headquartered in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, the operation began as a mail ordering catalog company and began opening retail locations in 1925. The company was bought by the management of the American big box chain Kmart in 2005, the Kmart management formed Sears Holdings upon completion of the merger. In terms of domestic revenue, Sears was the largest retailer in the United States until October 1989, when Walmart surpassed the record.[3] As of 2017, Sears is the 23rd largest retailer in the United States overall.[4] Sears had divisions in Canada and Mexico, but were sold as well as several other subsidiaries within its brand.

History[edit]
Mail order catalog[edit]




Richard Warren Sears


Richard Warren Sears came from a wealthy family, but lost it all in speculation. Sears [5] then started working as a railroad station agent in North Redwood, Minnesota, as well as in Minneapolis. While in Redwood, a jeweler received an impressive shipment of watches which were unwanted. Sears purchased them, then sold the watches at a low price, to the station agents and made a considerable profit.
In Minneapolis, he started a mail order watch business. Sears started this company in 1886. He called it "R.W. Sears Watch Company." Within the first year he met Alvah C Roebuck, a watch repairman. The next year, they relocated the business to Chicago. In 1887 Sears published a mail-order catalog offering watches, diamonds, and jewelry. Two years later he sold his business for $100,000 and relocated to Iowa, intending to be a rural banker. Restless, however, he returned to Minnesota and established a new mail-order firm selling watches and jewelry, with Roebuck as his partner. This A.C. Roebuck & Company later became "Sears, Roebuck and Company" and in 1893 moved to Chicago.[6]
Farmers did business in small rural towns. Before the Sears catalog, farmers usually purchased supplies (often at high prices and on credit) from local general stores with narrow selections of goods. Prices were negotiated, and relied on the storekeeper's estimate of a customer's creditworthiness. Sears took advantage of this by publishing catalogs offering customers a wider selection of products at clearly stated prices. The business grew quickly. The first Sears catalog was published in 1888.
In 1892, Richard Sears and Alvah Roebuck founded the A. C. Roebuck watch company. In 1893, they renamed the company to Sears, Roebuck & Company and began to diversify. By 1894, the Sears catalog had grown to 322 pages, featuring sewing machines, bicycles, sporting goods, automobiles (produced from 1905 to 1915 by Lincoln Motor Car Works of Chicago, no relation to the current Ford line),[7] and a host of other new items. By 1895, the company was producing a 532-page catalog. Sales were greater than US$400,000 in 1893 and more than US$750,000 two years later.[8] By 1896, dolls, stoves and groceries had been added to the catalog.

The company had sales of US$800,000 in 1895, but the national Panic of 1893—a full scale depression—caused a cash squeeze and large quantities of unsold merchandise. Roebuck decided to quit (though he later returned in a publicity role). Sears offered Roebuck's half of the company to Chicago businessman Aaron Nusbaum, who in turn brought in his brother-in-law Julius Rosenwald, to whom Sears owed money. In August 1895, they bought Roebuck's half of the company for US$75,000. The new Sears, Roebuck and Company was reincorporated in Illinois with a capital stock of US$150,000 in August 1895.
The transaction was handled by Albert Henry Loeb of the Chicago Law Firm of Loeb & Adler (now known as Arnstein & Lehr, LLP). Copies of the transaction documents are now displayed on the walls of the law firm.[9] Sears and Rosenwald got along well with each other, but not with Nusbaum. Sears and Rosenwald bought him out for US$1.3 million in 1903.[10] Rosenwald brought to the mail order firm a rational management philosophy and diversified product lines: dry goods, consumer durables, drugs, hardware, furniture, and nearly anything else a farm household could desire. From 1895 to 1907, under Rosenwald's leadership as Vice President and Treasurer, annual sales of the company climbed from US$750,000 to upwards of US$50 million.
The prosperity of the company and their vision for greater expansion led Sears and Rosenwald to take the company public in 1906, with US$40 million in stock. However, they had to incorporate a new company in order to bring the operation public.
Sears and Rosenwald established Sears, Roebuck and Company (legal name- Sears, Roebuck and Co.) in 1906 in the state of New York and replaced the original company.[11] The current company inherits the history of the old company, but does not recognize the 1906 incorporation and instead recognizes the 1892 incorporation of the old company.
After Sears resigned the presidency in 1908 due to declining health, Rosenwald was named president and chairman of the board and had full control.[12] Sears' successful 1906 initial public offering (IPO) marks the first major retail IPO in American financial history and represented a coming of age, financially, of the consumer sector.[13]
In 1906, Sears opened its catalog plant and the Sears Merchandise Building Tower in Chicago.[14] Also, by that time, the Sears catalog had become known in the industry as "the Consumers' Bible". In 1933, Sears issued the first of its famous Christmas catalogs known as the "Sears Wishbook", a catalog featuring toys and gifts, separate from the annual Christmas Catalog. The catalog also entered the language, particularly of rural dwellers, as a euphemism for toilet paper.[15] From 1908 to 1940, the catalog even included ready-to-assemble kit houses.[16] Novelists and story writers often portrayed the importance of the catalog in the emotional lives of rural folk.
For children and their parents, the catalog was a "wish book" that was eagerly flipped through. It was not a question of purchasing but of dreaming; they made up stories about the lives of the models on the pages. The catalog was a means of entertainment, though much of its magic wore off with the passing of childhood.[17] The company was badly hurt during 1919–21 as a severe depression hit the nation's farms after farmers had overexpanded their holdings. To bail out the company, Rosenwald pledged $21 million of his personal wealth.[18]
By 1922, Sears had regained financial stability. First he oversaw the design and construction of the company's first department store within Sears, Roebuck's massive 16-hectare (40-acre) headquarters complex of offices, laboratories and mail-order operations at Homan Ave. and Arthington St. on Chicago's West Side. The store opened in 1925. In 1924, Rosenwald resigned the presidency, but remained as chairman until his death in 1932; his goal was to devote more time to philanthropy.[19]
Retail stores and diversification[edit]




Sears Tower


The mail order market was based on rural America, with a slow-growing population and far less spending power than urban America. Rosenwald decided to shift emphasis to urban America, and brought in Robert E. Wood to take charge. The first Sears retail stores were opened in conjunction with the company's mail order offices, typically in working-class neighborhoods far from the main shopping center. Sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women, especially with lines of hardware and building materials. It deemphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability, and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk. Its stores were oriented to motorists—set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience; had ample, free, off-street parking; and communicated a clear corporate identity. In the 1930s, the company designed fully air-conditioned, "windowless" stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns.[20]
From the 1920s to the 1950s, Sears built many urban department stores in the USA, Canada and Mexico (apart from, but not far from, existing central business districts), and they overshadowed the mail-order business. Starting in the 1950s, the company expanded into suburban markets, and malls in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1959, it had formed the Homart Development Company for developing malls. Many of the company's stores have undergone major renovations or replacement since the 1980s. Sears began to diversify in the 1930s, adding Allstate Insurance Company in 1931 and placing Allstate representatives in its stores in 1934. Over the decades it established major national brands, such as Kenmore, Craftsman, DieHard, Silvertone, Supertone, and Toughskins. The company became a conglomerate during the mid-20th century, adding Dean Witter and Coldwell Banker real estate in 1981, starting Prodigy as a joint venture with IBM in 1984, and introducing the Discover credit card in 1985. In March 2009, Sears purchased the social search engine Delver.
In 1974, Sears completed the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago, becoming the world's tallest building, a title it took from the former World Trade Center towers in New York. Sears moved to the new Prairie Stone Business Park in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, between 1993 and 1995.[21] The Sears Centre is a 10,001-seat multi-purpose arena located in Hoffman Estates adjacent to the Prairie Stone campus.[22] Even though its naming rights to the building expired in 2003 it remained the Sears Tower through early 2009. In March 2009 London-based insurer Willis Group Holdings, Ltd., was given the building's naming rights to entice the occupancy of the building. The official renaming as the Willis Tower took place on Thursday, July 16, 2009, during a public ceremony hosted by Willis Group Holdings.[23]
In the 1990s, the company began divesting itself of many non-retail entities, which were detrimental to the company's bottom line. Sears spun off its financial services arm which included brokerage business Dean Witter Reynolds and Discover Card. It sold its mall building subsidiary Homart to General Growth Properties in 1995.[24] Sears later acquired hardware chain Orchard Supply Hardware in 1996 and started home improvement store The Great Indoors in 1997.[25]
Decline and Sears Holdings[edit]
In 1993, Sears terminated its famous general merchandise catalog because of sinking sales and profits, and in 1997 sold 85% of its Mexico affiliate to Grupo Carso. Sears Holdings continues to produce specialty catalogs and reintroduced a smaller version of the Holiday Wish Book in 2007. In 2003, Sears sold its retail credit card operation to Citibank.[26] The remaining card operations were sold to JPMorgan Chase in August 2005. In 2003, Sears opened a new concept store called Sears Grand. Sears Grand stores carry everything that a regular Sears carries, and more. Sears Grand stores are about 175,000 to 225,000 square feet (16,300 to 20,900 m2).
On November 17, 2004, Sears announced it was being acquired by the management of Kmart Holding Corporation (company that owns Kmart) for $11 billion after Kmart completed its bankruptcy (USA Today Nov. 17, 2004). As a part of the acquisition, Kmart Holding Corporation along with Kmart was transferred to the new Sears Holdings Corporation and Sears was purchased by the new Sears Holdings. The new company started trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange, Sears sold its single letter ticker symbol 'S' it had held since 1910 to Sprint.[27] The new corporation announced that it would continue to operate stores under both the Sears and Kmart brands. In 2005, the company began renovating some Kmart stores and converting them to the Sears Essentials format, only to change them later to Sears Grands.[28]
The combined company's profits peaked at $1.5 billion in 2006, then dwindled to nearly nothing by 2010. From 2011 to 2016 the company lost $10.4 billion. In 2014 its total debt ($4.2 billion at the end of January 2017) surpassed its market cap ($974.1 million as of March 21).[29]
Sears spent much of 2014 and 2015 selling off portions of its balance sheet; namely Lands' End and its stake in Sears Canada. Sears Canada was one of the biggest e-commerce players in Canada, with CAN$505 million in sales in 2015—more than Walmart and others who have begun pushing aggressively into online sales, such as Canadian Tire.[30] Sears stated that the company was looking to focus on becoming a more tech-driven retailer. Sears' CEO and top shareholder said the sell-off of key assets in the last year had given the retailer the money it needs to speed up its transformation.[30] As of 2015, Sears Holdings had lost a total of US$7 billion in the last four years. In part, the retailer was trying to curb losses by using a loyalty program called Shop Your Way.[30] Sears believed the membership scheme would be a long-term play for the company, and it would enhance repeat business and customer loyalty.[30]
Seritage Growth Properties is the REIT spinoff of some of the holding company's Sears and Kmart stores. The REIT announced in October 2016 that it was terminating 17 store leases. All of the locations are associated with Kmart locations.[31] Also in October 2016, Moody's Investor Services downgraded Sears to speculative grade liquidity rating. The speculative grade liquidity means that Sears is expected to have to rely on external financing and monetization of its alternative assets according to Moody's VP Christina Boni.[31]
In late 2016 and early 2017, some significant steps were taken by Edward Lampert, president, chief executive officer and top shareholder of Sears Holding Corp. Lampert, with personal assets estimated at US$2 billion, is also the founder and manager of the hedge fund ESL Investments Inc.[32] He provided an additional loan of US$500 million to the company and said he would provide letters of credit to Sears for additional amounts, reportedly totaling US$200 million and possibly increasing to a half billion dollars in the future.[33]
Lampert also concluded an arrangement that sold the Craftsman brand to Stanley Black & Decker Inc. for approximately US$900 million.[34] During this period, the company also announced that it would close 150 stores (109 Kmart and 41 Sears outlets), in an attempt to cut its losses after a decline in sales of 12 to 13 percent during the holiday shopping season and the largest quarterly loss since 2013. Matt McGinley, an analyst at Evercore ISI, stated, "In the long run, the cash isn't likely to change the company's course. ... I don't think there is any viable path to any sort of profitability."[35]
In February 2017, Sears announced a restructuring plan that is hoped to cut costs by US$1 billion via selling more stores, cutting jobs and selling brands.[36] During the second quarter of 2017, 42 Sears stores in 40 states closed.[37] Later on Sears announced that it closed an additional 12 stores.[38] In July 2017, Sears announced it would close another 43 stores (8 Sears and 35 Kmart stores). Those closures are in addition to the previously announced closures.[39]
Since 2010, Sears has gone from more than 3,500 physical stores to 695 US stores.[40] Sales at Sears stores dropped 10.3 percent in the final quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.[41]
In October 2017, Sears and appliance manufacturer Whirlpool Corporation reportedly ended their 101-year old association that had allowed Whirlpool appliances to be sold at Sears stores and, later, at Kmart. The companies reportedly were unable to come to an agreement on pricing issues. [42]
In November 2017, Sears announced they were closing 18 Sears stores and 45 Kmart stores. The stores would be closing by January 2018 bringing the store count to 680 Sears stores.

Sears Essentials was a chain of discount stores that were common retrofit remodels of existing Kmart stores. Their product lines were similar to that of Sears Grand stores.

National Tire and Battery (NTB) & National Tire Warehouse (NTW) is an American brand of auto service centers. It was formerly owned by Sears until it was spun off in 2003. Sears created the brand in 1997 by consolidating the Tire America (TA) and National Tire Warehouse (NTW) brands, adding the "B" to include its DieHard brand of batteries.[58] Sears sold the brand, which consisted mostly of stores set apart from its name brand stores, in 2003 to TBC Corporation. A Sears spokesman said "Because of the separate branding and the lack of proximity to our retail operations, we weren't able to drive growth like a TBC could".[59] The chain of 226 stores was reported to have brought in $425 million in revenue and $60 million in profit in 2002.[59]

Sears Catalog Sales Stores were located in small towns. These stores were very small, even smaller than Sears' current Hometown Dealer stores. At catalog stores, some items could be ordered from the floor, such as appliances; other items could be ordered from catalogs at the store. These stores were often placed in rural markets which were far from full-line Sears stores, allowing for customers to purchase Sears products more easily. These stores were closed in 1993 when Sears closed its catalog business.

These stores are designed to be much larger than the typical in-store Sears furniture department, which averages around 7,800 square feet. Sears opened Homelife stores as stores-in-a-store to replace the exist furniture departments within large full-line Sears stores. Other Sears HomeLifes were opened as free-standing locations.[62] Sears sold the stores to Citicorp Venture in 1999, who changed the chain's name to just "HomeLife". They opened more locations, some inside large Sears stores or near the store depending on space available. HomeLife closed its last stores in 2001.[63] In Puerto Rico, a few HomeLife locations are still present.

Employee relations[edit]

Sears has struggled with employee relations. One notable example was the shift in 1992 from an hourly wage based on longevity to a base wage (usually between US$3.50 and US$6 per hour) and commissions ranging from 0.5% to 11%. Sears claimed the new base wage, often constituting a substantial (up to 40%) cut in pay, was done "to be successful in this highly competitive environment".[95]
In early October 2007, Sears cut commission rates for employees in select departments to anywhere from 0.5% to 4% but equalized the base wage across all Home Improvement and Electronics departments. In 2011, commission rates on non-base items were cut by 2% in the electronics department. In late 2009, the commission on sales of "base items" from the electronic department was cut to 1%. As of 2017, appliances is the only remaining department where compensation is based entirely on commission. Other departments give a base pay plus commission. In many stores, jewelry department associates receive a low base salary with 1% commission on their sales.
