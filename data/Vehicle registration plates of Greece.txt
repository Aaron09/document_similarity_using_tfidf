Greek Europlate (Athens prefecture)


Greek vehicle registration plates are composed of three letters and four digits per plate (e.g. ΑΑΑ-1000) printed in black on a white background. The letters represent the district (prefecture) that issues the plates while the numbers begin from 1000 to 9999. As from 2004, a blue strip was added on the left showing the country code of Greece (GR) in white text and the Flag of Europe. Similar plates with digits beginning from 1 to 999 are issued for motorcycles which exceed 50 cc.
With the exception of Athens and Thessaloniki, all districts are represented by the first 2 letters. The final letter in the sequence changes in Greek alphabetical order after 9,000 issued plates. For example, Patras plates are ΑΧΑ-1000, where ΑΧ represents the Achaia prefecture of which Patras is the capital. When ΑΧΑ-9999 is reached the plates turn to ΑΧΒ-1000 and this continues until ΑΧΧ is finished. Only the letters from the intersection between the Latin and Greek alphabets by glyph appearance are used, namely Α, Β, Ε, Ζ, Η, Ι, Κ, Μ, Ν, Ο, Ρ, Τ, Υ, Χ (in Greek alphabetical order). This is because Greece is a contracting party to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which in Annex 2 requires registration numbers to be displayed in capital Latin characters and Arabic numerals. The rule applies in a similar way in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria.
Combinations used for overseas residents are L-NNNN (where L = letter and N = number) and are limited. Until 2003, taxis used L-NNNN; the plate was aligned with the prefecture and the letters were colored red.

History[edit]




1972–1982






1983–2003






2004 to present


1911-1954[edit]
Up until 1954 Greek number plates were quite simple: black numbers on a white bakcground, indicating the serial number shown on the car's license. These started at 1 and advanced to approximately 75-000 when the system was changed. The owner had to provide the plates and specifications were minimal: the size of the plates and numbers, as well as their respective colours. This meant that plates were not very uniform. Taxis had to indicate the initial of the town they wwere licensed in (e.g. "A" for Athens).
1956-1971[edit]
In 1956, the system was NNNNNN.
1972–1982[edit]
In 1972, they became lettered and the system was LL-NNNN while trucks used L-NNNN.
1983–2003[edit]
In 1983, the system was LLL-NNNN and the first two letters are prefecture letters.
2004 to present[edit]
In 2004, the euroband was added.
Car designations[edit]
