History[edit]
See also: List of CSX Transportation predecessor railroads




CSX headquarters building in Jacksonville, Florida


CSX Transportation was formed on July 1, 1986, by combining the railroads of the former Chessie System with the Seaboard System Railroad. The originator of the Seaboard System was the former Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which previously merged with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1967, and later with the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, as well as several smaller subsidiaries such as the Clinchfield Railroad, Atlanta & West Point Railroad, Monon Railroad and the Georgia Railroad. The origin of the Chessie System was the former Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, which had merged with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and the Western Maryland Railway.
In 1995, CSX started a new liability insurance requirement of $200 million to introduce their official policy "No steam on its own wheels", banning the operation of steam locomotives and other antique rail equipment on their trackage due to serious business, safety concerns, and increased risk.[3][4]
On June 23, 1997, CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) filed a joint application with the Surface Transportation Board for authority to purchase, divide, and operate the assets of the 11,000-mile (18,000 km) Conrail, which had been created in 1976 by bringing together several ailing Northeastern railway systems into a government-owned corporation. On June 6, 1998, the STB approved the CSX–NS application and set August 22, 1998, as the effective date of its decision. CSX acquired 42 percent of Conrail's assets, and NS received the remaining 58 percent. As a result of the transaction, CSX's rail operations grew to include some 3,800 miles (6,100 km) of the Conrail system (predominantly lines that had belonged to the former New York Central Railroad). CSX began operating its trains on its portion of the Conrail network on June 1, 1999. CSX now serves much of the Eastern United States, with a few routes into nearby Canadian cities.

The name came about during merger talks between Chessie System, Inc. and Seaboard System Railroad, Inc., commonly called "Chessie" and "Seaboard". The company chairmen said it was important for the new name to include neither of those names because it was a partnership. Employees were asked for suggestions, most of which consisted of combinations of the initials. At the same time a temporary shorthand name was needed for discussions with the Interstate Commerce Commission. "CSC" was chosen but belonged to a trucking company in Virginia. "CSM" (for "Chessie-Seaboard Merger") was also taken. The lawyers decided to use "CSX", and the name stuck. In the public announcement, it was said that "CSX is singularly appropriate. C can stand for Chessie, S for Seaboard, and X, which actually has no meaning." However, an August 9, 2016, article on the Railway Age website stated that " ... the 'X' was for 'Consolidated' ".[5] The T had to be added to CSX when used as a reporting mark because reporting marks that end in X means that the car is owned by a leasing company or private car owner. Its current slogan, "How Tomorrow Moves", appeared in 2008.[6]
In 2014 Canadian Pacific Railway approached CSX with an offer to merge the two companies, but CSX declined, and in 2015 Canadian Pacific made an attempt to purchase and merge with Norfolk Southern.[7]
In 2017 CSX announced Hunter Harrison as its new chief executive; a settlement with activist investor Paul Hilal and Mantle Ridge.[8] CSX added five new directors to their board, including Harrison and Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal. Mantle Ridge owns 4.9 percent of CSX.[9] On December 14th 2017, CSX announced that Hunter Harrison was on medical leave. Two days after the announcement, Harrison passed away, one day after being hospitalized for complications of an ongoing illness. Because of this CSX lost nearly 10% of it's value. [10]
CSX divisions[edit]
CSX operates two regions of five divisions each: the Northern, based in Calumet City, Illinois; and Southern, based in Jacksonville, Florida.
Northern Region Divisions[edit]

Great Lakes Division, based in Indianapolis, Indiana
Chicago Division, based in Calumet City, Illinois
Albany Division, based in Selkirk, New York
Baltimore Division, based in Baltimore, Maryland
Louisville Division, based in Cincinnati, Ohio

One line in the Northern Region travels into Canada:

Montreal Subdivision (Albany Division) from Massena, New York, to Beauharnois, Quebec

Southern Region Divisions[edit]

Atlanta Division, based in Atlanta, Georgia
Nashville Division, based in Nashville, Tennessee
Florence Division, based in Florence, South Carolina
Jacksonville Division, based in Jacksonville, Florida (at Dufford Center)

Unit trains[edit]

CSX operates the Juice Train—a collective name for Train Nos. O823, Q740 and Q741, Q743, and Q745—which consists of Tropicana cars that carry fresh orange juice between Bradenton, Florida, and the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey. The train also runs from Bradenton to Fort Pierce, Florida, via the Florida East Coast Railway. In the 21st century, the Juice Train has been studied as a model of efficient rail transportation that can compete with trucks and other modes in the perishable-goods trade.[citation needed] All Tropicana Trains are now added to Intermodal Traims such as Q188 and Q124.
Coke Express trains run between Pittsburgh and Chicago, and other places in the Rust Belt, carrying coke to industries, mainly steel mills.
CSX also runs daily trash trains Q702 and Q703 from The Bronx to Philadelphia (via Selkirk Yard) and then Petersburg, Virginia, where they interchange with NS. These trains consist of 89-foot (27 m) flatcars loaded with four containers of trash. Another pair of trains, Q710 and Q711, originate in Kearny, New Jersey, and terminate in Russell, Kentucky.
Another style of unit train is a local trash train, D765, that runs between the Maryland towns of Derwood and Dickerson. The train runs daily except on Sundays; on holidays it sometimes runs twice a day. Trash is carried from Montgomery County's Shady Grove Transfer Station to a waste-to-energy plant located off the PEPCO lead to Mirant's Dickerson Generating Station. The trip is roughly 17 miles (27 km), and the train is made up of National Steel Car Company-built well cars, hauling 40-foot (12 m) containers. The first NEMX equipment was built when the D765 first started operations in 1995. In recent years, the fleet has been somewhat upgraded, repainted, and new cars have been constructed. In the early days, the locomotives powering the train were a GP40-2/RDMT slug set, but currently the train can be upwards of 47 cars. The locomotives that now routinely power the train are a pair of EMD SD50s.
Working with Union Pacific, CSX runs an extended haul perishables train, Q090. Known by the railroad as the "Apple Train" or "Salad Shooter", the train runs from Wallula, Washington, to Schenectady, New York. This train typically runs with three of Union Pacific's newest locomotives and has its extended haul inspection from Wallula to Schenectady at Cleveland-Collinwood Yard on CSX headed in both directions. On the return trip, the train is labeled Q091. CSX modified its Train Handling rule book to allow this train to use more power axles.[11] In early 2012 the "Salad Shooter" derailed just a few miles northwest of Greenwich, Ohio. No injuries were reported in the incident.[citation needed]
Locomotives[edit]
Paint and Aesthetics[edit]




A new CSX ES44AC in the YN3 paint scheme.


In 2002, CSXT No. 8503, an EMD SD50 (that has since been downgraded to an SD50-2), was painted in the new yellow and blue YN3 scheme. More than 1,000 CSX locomotives have since been painted in the YN3 scheme.[12]
CSX recently created a new paint scheme, known as YN3b, which updates YN3 with the most recent CSX logo. The first unit to wear this scheme was ES44AH 950. Currently, CSX's ES44AHs 950-999 and 3000–3249 and the ET44AHs 3250-3474 wear the scheme, along with recently repainted older locomotives, the first of which was SD70MAC 4719, which was repainted at the Huntington Locomotive Shops in September 2012. YN3b is also commonly found on the SD40-3 rebuilds.
All of the former-Conrail locomotives in active service have been repainted in a CSX livery.
In the 1990s, CSXT began placing a lightning bolt decal below the road number on locomotives with AC traction. The practice has since ceased.
CSX also has several locomotives with "spirit" stickers with a name of an important person or location in the CSX system.
In 2016, CSX placed the logos of several predecessor railroads on some locomotives, in order to maintain legal control of the logos.
Locomotives[edit]
Former Conrail locomotives can be spotted by recognizing phase differences in engine models and numbering. Other spotting details can be inconsistent, but can include a number of the following: red marker lights, Leslie model RS3L or RS5T air horns (only a few original horns remain. Many have been replaced by K5LAs), former Conrail SD40-2s ride on Flexicoil "C" trucks and have anti-climbers, ditch lights mounted beneath the anti-climber, headlights above the cab (vs. CSX's standard practice of nose mounted headlights on all wide-nose GE units), and modified "Bright Future" paint with battery box faces painted yellow (instead of black or blue).
In 2015, CSX traded its 12 EMD SD80AC (SD80MAC)s for 12 SD40-2s from Norfolk Southern. They have all since been rebuild as SD40-3s.
CSX has been significant in rebuilding locomotives. CSX has 2 rebuilds of the SD40-2; the SD40-3 and SD40-3|SD40-3. CSX has rebuilt GP35 and GP30 units as road slugs. CSX has also downgraded SD50 and GP40-2 units in order to decrease the wear and tear on the engines. Among its EMD rebuilds, CSX has done rebuilding on many GE locomotives as well. CSX has re-powered most of its GE CW60AC and CW60AH locomotives with a GEVO-16 engine rated at 4,600 hp (3,430 kW), essentially making them an over-engined ES44AH called a CW46AH by CSX. Former Conrail GE B40-8 units have also been downgraded to 2,000 hp (1,491 kW) in an attempt to decrease wheel slip and low speeds. They were redesignated as B20-8s and CSX has since sold or stored most of these units including the 6 axle GE C40-8s. Another group of projects are the "heavy" units. CSX has modified some GE CW44AC and CW44AH units to heavy units by adding extra weight and new computers to increase tractive effort at low speeds.
CSX has also obtained a few EMD F40PHs that were retired from Amtrak for executive office car service and geometry trains.
With the arrival of Hunter Harrison, CSX has begun to store many locomotives. By the end of 2017, CSX plans to store or retire all of the GE CW40-8, CW40-9, CW60AC, CW60AH, CW46AH, EMD SD50, SD50-2, SD50-3, SD60M, SD60I, SD70M, SD70AC, and SD70AE (SD70ACe) units. Most of the GE C40-8, B40-8, and B20-8 units stored in Corbin, Kentucky have already been retired and sold off. However, since Hunter Harrison passed away on December 16, 2017 with James Foote taking his place on December 22, 2017, the retirements might not happen.
