The telephone system in Andorra, including mobile, data and Internet is operated exclusively by the Andorran national telecommunications company, Andorra Telecom, formerly known as Servei de Telecomunicacions d'Andorra (STA), which operates with the brand SOM. The same company is also responsible for managing the technical infrastructure and national broadcasting networks for radio and television, both analogue and digital.
At one time, Andorra shared the country code of France (+33), and also had a special routing code for calls from Spain, but now has its own country calling code, 376.
