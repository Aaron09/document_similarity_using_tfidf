The One Piece manga and anime series features an extensive cast of characters created by Eiichiro Oda. The series takes place in a fictional universe where vast numbers of pirates, soldiers, revolutionaries, and other adventurers fight each other, using various superhuman and supernatural abilities. The series' storyline follows the adventures of a group of pirates as they search for the "One Piece" treasure.
Monkey D. Luffy is the series' main protagonist, a young pirate who wishes to succeed Gol D. Roger, the deceased King of the Pirates, by finding his treasure, the "One Piece". Throughout the series, Luffy gathers himself a diverse crew, named the Straw Hat Pirates, including: the three-sword-wielding Roronoa Zoro, the thief and navigator Nami, the cowardly marksman and inventor Usopp, the cook and martial artist Sanji, the anthropomorphic reindeer and doctor Tony Tony Chopper, the archaeologist Nico Robin, the cyborg shipwright Franky, and the living skeleton musician Brook. Together they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams, encountering other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and foes.
The majority of the characters are human, but the cast also includes, among others, giants, mermen / mermaids, and humanoid fishmen[a] Many of the characters possess supernatural abilities gained by eating so-called "Devil Fruits".

Creation and conception[edit]
Several characters have been stated to be based on actual people, such as: Eustass Kid (Eustace the Monk and William Kidd), X. Drake (Sir Francis Drake), Basil Hawkins (Basil Ringrose and John Hawkins), Capone "Gang" Bege (Al Capone and William Le Sauvage), Jewelry Bonney (Anne Bonny), Urouge (Aruj), and Scratchmen Apoo (Chui A-poo).[ch. 508] The cross dresser Emporio Ivankov is based on Dr. Frank N. Furter and Norio Imamura. Norio had asked Oda to draw more okama (homosexual) characters and became Ivankov's first voice actor.[ch. 570]
Oda had created Helmeppo before he created Captain Morgan, Helmeppo's father. Oda originally named Morgan after "Chop," with the character's full title being "Naval Captain Chop" or "Sailor Chop". "Sailor" in Japanese is suihei (水兵), and "Suihei Chop" is a fighting technique used by Giant Baba, a Japanese wrestler. He created several versions of Morgan before settling on the final design. After an editor told him that Morgan, in Oda's words, "looked lame", he changed the design to its final style.[vol. 1:p. 144 (en)]
Straw Hat Pirates[edit]
The protagonists of the One Piece series are all the members of the Straw Hat Pirates (麦わらの一味, Mugiwara no Ichimi), a crew of nine pirates captained by Monkey D. Luffy. The crew's number increases throughout the series, as Luffy recruits new members. Once Usopp joins the Straw Hat Pirates, they gain their own ship, the Going Merry, which is later destroyed and replaced by a larger and more powerful vessel, the Thousand Sunny created by their shipwright Franky. Two years later, the Straw Hats gain a new fleet, called the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of 5,640 pirates from seven different crews; Luffy objects to the idea of being a fleet commander, and organizes his new army in a way that they may act independently, but when one crew is in trouble, the others must do what they can to help them.
Monkey D. Luffy[edit]
Main article: Monkey D. Luffy
Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー・D・ルフィ, Monkī Dī Rufi) is the primary protagonist of the One Piece series. At age seven, he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure, the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実, Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gives his body the properties of rubber. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril causing Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing him. After this, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks, resolving instead to start a crew of his own and become King of the Pirates.[ch. 1] Displeased by Shanks spoiling his grandson, Garp takes Luffy to be raised by Curly Dadan and her mountain bandits, who he strong-arms into taking him in. During Luffy's time there, he becomes a sworn brother with Garp's other ward Ace, and local runaway noble Sabo.[ch. 582–589] Ten years later, and still wearing Shanks' treasured head covering, Luffy forms and captains his own pirate crew called The Straw Hat Pirates and sets sail for the Grand Line, quickly gaining infamy as "Straw Hat" Luffy (麦わらのルフィ, Mugiwara no Rufi).[ch. 2, 7, 96, 98] Eventually, after his strength proves insufficient to save Ace from execution, he spends two years on a secluded island learning the use of the three colors of Haki as well as Gear Fourth from Silvers Rayleigh, before heading to the New World.[ch. 590–602] Luffy is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka.[1]
In the 4Kids Entertainment English adaptation, he is voiced by Erica Schroeder.[2] In the Funimation Entertainment English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Colleen Clinkenbeard.[3]
Roronoa Zoro[edit]
Main article: Roronoa Zoro
Roronoa Zoro (ロロノア・ゾロ, named after François l'Olonnais) is a swordsman who uses up to three swords simultaneously, holding one in each hand and a third in his mouth.[ch. 3, 5, 28] To fulfill a promise to Kuina, his deceased childhood rival, he aims to replace "Hawk Eye" Mihawk as the world's greatest swordsman.[ch. 5, 50] Traveling the seas in search of Mihawk and making a living as a bounty hunter, he becomes infamously known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro (海賊狩りのゾロ, Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro). Eventually, he comes into conflict with Helmeppo. To prevent the harm of innocent civilians, Zoro allows himself to be incarcerated temporarily, while Helmeppo plots to have him killed. Zoro is saved from execution by Luffy in exchange for becoming his first crewman. At that point, Zoro makes it clear that he would turn on his captain if he ever stepped between him and his dream.[ch. 2–6] However, Zoro grows fond of his crew and after several defeats in their defense, his priorities change and he convinces Mihawk to take him on as a student.[ch. 51f., 485, 597]
In the anime television series, his voice actor is Kazuya Nakai.[1] In the 4Kids English adaptation, his name is spelled Roronoa Zolo, and he is voiced by Marc Diraison.[2] In the Funimation English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Christopher R. Sabat.[3]
Nami[edit]
Main article: Nami (One Piece)
Adopted and raised by navy seaman turned tangerine farmer Bellemere, Nami (ナミ) and her older sister Nojiko, witness their mother being murdered by the infamous Arlong, whose pirate gang occupies their island and extracts tribute from the population. Striking a deal with him, Nami, still a child, but already an accomplished cartographer who dreams of drawing a complete map of the world, joins the pirates, hoping to buy freedom for her village eventually. Growing up as a pirate-hating pirate, drawing maps for Arlong, and stealing treasure from other pirates, Nami becomes an excellent burglar, pickpocket, and navigator with an exceptional ability to forecast weather.[ch. 77, 95, 130] After Arlong betrays her, and he and his gang are defeated by the Straw Hat Pirates, Nami joins them in pursuit of her dream and acquires infamy herself as "Cat Burglar" Nami (泥棒猫のナミ, Dorobō Neko no Nami).[ch. 94f., 435]
In the anime television series, Nami is voiced by Akemi Okamura,[4] In the 4Kids English adaptation, she is voiced by Kerry Williams.[5] In the Funimation English adaptation, her voice is provided by Luci Christian.[6]
Usopp[edit]
During his early childhood, Usopp (ウソップ, Usoppu) is abandoned by his father, Yasopp, who leaves to join the Red-Haired Pirates. Then, as Banchina (バンキーナ, Bankīna), his mother falls ill, Usopp starts telling tall tales, expressing his hope that his father will return and take them out to sea. Even after his mother dies, Usopp does not blame his father for leaving. Despite his cowardly disposition, he strives to become a great pirate himself.[ch. 25, 41] He is a gifted inventor, painter, and sculptor.[ch. 42, 106, 190] In combat, he relies primarily on slingshots to fire various kinds of ammunition with great precision.[ch. 332] Later in the series, he achieves Observation Haki, while defending his captain. Eventually, he achieves notoriety under his alter-ego "Sniper King the King of Snipers" (狙撃の王様そげキング, Sogeki no Ō-sama Sogekingu), a hero sniper wearing a golden mask and cape. Still later in the series he is known as "God" Usopp [ch. 435]
In the anime series, his voice actor is Kappei Yamaguchi.[1] Jason Griffith and Sonny Strait provide his voice in the 4Kids and Funimation English adaptations, respectively.[3][7]
In a 2007 Oricon poll, Usopp was voted the 10th most wanted character to receive a spin-off among all respondents, and the 5th most popular among males.[8] In a review of Funimation Entertainment's second DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter notes that Usopp "brings lots of comic relief to the series", but also comments that he "can be downright annoying at times".[9]
Sanji  [edit]
While serving as an apprentice cook on a passenger ship, nine-year-old Vinsmoke Sanji (ヴィンスモーク・サンジ, Vinsumōku Sanji) stands up to a boarding party of pirates led by the infamous "Red Foot" Zeff (赫足のゼフ, Aka-Ashi no Zefu). During the encounter, Sanji is swept into the sea by a massive wave. Zeff jumps in after him because of their common dream of finding the All Blue (オールブルー, Ōru Burū), a legendary sea, containing every kind of fish in the world. While castaways together, the pirate saves Sanji's life yet again by giving him all of their food. After their eventual rescue, Sanji stays with Zeff for several years and helps him build a floating restaurant, the Baratie (バラティエ). Zeff in turn makes him a first-rate cook and teaches him his kick-based fighting style.[ch. 56–59] Mirroring Zeff, Sanji will never refuse a starving person a meal, and when fighting only uses his legs, to protect the hands he needs to cook.[ch. 48, 370] He also develops an unusual weakness for women, and makes it a principle never to harm one, even if it means his death.[ch. 403] Eventually, he becomes infamous under the name of "Black Leg" Sanji (黒脚のサンジ, Kuro Ashi no Sanji),[ch. 435] and, while training for a period of two years in Emporio Ivankov's Kamabakka Queendom (カマバッカ王国, Kamabakka Ōkoku), develops the Sky Walk (空中歩行 (スカイ・ウォーク), Sukai Wōku), a variant of the Six Powers (六式, Rokushiki) technique Moonwalk (月歩, Geppo), which allows him to essentially run through air.[ch. 635]
In the Japanese anime television series, he is voiced by Hiroaki Hirata.[10] In the 4Kids English adaptation, he is voiced by David Moo.[11] In the Funimation English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Eric Vale.[3]
Tony Tony Chopper[edit]
Tony Tony Chopper (トニートニー・チョッパー, Tonī Tonī Choppā) is a doctor and a blue-nosed reindeer. The power of the Zoan-type Human-Human Fruit (ヒトヒトの実, Hito Hito no Mi) provides him with the ability to transform into a reindeer or a reindeer hybrid.[ch. 140] A self-developed drug he calls Rumble Ball (ランブル・ボール, Ranburu Bōru) enables him to perform even more transformations.[ch. 149] When complimented, Chopper acts really sad and sometimes yells at the animal who complimented him to stop trying to make him happy.[ch. 140]
His voice actress is Ikue Ōtani.[12]Kazue Ikura voiced Tony Tony Chopper for episodes 254-263.[citation needed] In the 4Kids and Funimation English adaptations, his voice is supplied by Lisa Ortiz and Brina Palencia, respectively.[13][14]
When creating Chopper, Oda wanted a mascot who is both cute and very weak.[15] An IGN review of the manga praised Chopper's character as one of the best in the series and said that he was able to be both touching and funny.[16] With Chopper's back story, Oda wanted to illustrate that one need not be blood-related to be considered family.[17]
Nico Robin[edit]
Growing up in Ohara (オハラ), home of the world's oldest and largest library, Nico Robin (ニコ・ロビン, Niko Robin) becomes an archaeologist at the age of eight.[ch. 218,391f.] At some point she gains the power of the Paramecia-type Flower-Flower Fruit (ハナハナの実, Hana Hana no Mi), which allows her to have temporary copies of parts of her body, including her eyes and ears, which spring up on surfaces near her.[ch. 170] Behind her teachers' backs she acquires from them the outlawed knowledge of how to translate the ancient stones called Ponegliffs (歴史の本文 ( ポーネグリフ), Pōnegurifu, alt. Poneglyphs), which are scattered around the world. She comes to share their goal of finding the illusive Real Ponegliff (真の歴史の本文 (リオ・ポーネグリフ), Rio Pōnegurifu), which is said to tell the world's lost history.[ch. 218] However, the World Government finds out about these efforts and sends a battlefleet to stop them. Only Robin escapes the devastating attack that claims the lives of the island's entire population, including that of her mother.[ch. 218, 395] Called "Devil Child" (悪魔の子, Akuma no Ko), traumatized, and with a bounty on her head, Robin lives a life on the run, unable to trust anyone.[ch. 218] To survive, she cooperates with various pirates and other outlaws, until eventually joining forces with Sir Crocodile, leading Baroque Works with him, using the codename "Ms. All-Sunday" (ミス・オールサンデー, Misu Ōrusandē).[ch. 398] and becoming their vice-president.[ch. 218] After Baroque Works falls apart, with nowhere else to go, she tags along with the Straw Hat Pirates[ch. 218] and grows so fond of them that she gives herself up to the Government in order to save them. Only after they discover her motives, and declare open war on her powerful nemesis to get her back, does she come to realize that she has finally found people who will never sell her out, and becomes a part of the crew.[citation needed] After the two-year period where the Straw Hats are separated, Robin further hones her Devil Fruit powers to the point she can create a full-bodied duplicate of herself.
In the anime television series, Robin's voice actress is Yuriko Yamaguchi.[18] In the 4Kids English adaptation, her Baroque Works codename was changed to Miss Sunday and she is voiced by Veronica Taylor.[13] In the Funimation English adaptation, her voice is supplied by Stephanie Young.[19]
Franky[edit]
The son of pirate parents who abandon him at age ten, Cutty Flam (カティ・フラム, Kati Furamu), nicknamed Franky (フランキー, Furankī), is taken in as an apprentice by a shipwright who secretly holds the plans for a devastating ancient weapon.[ch. 344, 354, 427] Franky's recklessness eventually provides an opportunity for World Government agents seeking these plans.[ch. 356] Attempting to rescue his master, Franky suffers severe injuries and only survives by rebuilding parts of his body using pieces of scrap metal, turning himself into a cola-powered cyborg with super-human strength.[ch. 336, 339, 352, 357f.] After gaining notoriety as "Cyborg" Franky (サイボーグ フランキー, Saibōgu Furankī), and to fulfill his dream of sailing a ship he built around the world, he constructs the Thousand Sunny, a brigantine-rigged sloop-of-war, for the Straw Hat Pirates and joins the crew.[ch. 435–437]
In the anime television series, his voice actor is Kazuki Yao.[20] Patrick Seitz provides his voice in the Funimation English adaptation.[21]
Brook[edit]
Already a pirate before the time of Roger, "Humming" Brook (ブルック, Burukku) first enters the Grand Line as vice-captain of the music-themed Rumbar Pirates. Leaving their pet, the infant whale Laboon at Reverse Mountain, they promise to return after sailing around the world.[ch. 487] Instead, they are annihilated, with one exception. The power of the Paramecia-type Revive-Revive Fruit (ヨミヨミの実, Yomi Yomi no Mi) allows "Dead Bones" Brook to rise again and live a second life as a skeleton.[ch. 443] Fifty years later, Brook's goal is still to fulfill his late crew's promise, and to that end he joins the Straw Hat Pirates.[ch. 459][citation needed] He is an excellent musician, who says that he can play any instrument, although he is usually seen playing the violin.[ch. 486] He can even influence people with his music to the point of making them fall asleep.[ch. 454] While separated from the other Straw Hats, and incognito as "Soul King" Brook, he gains world fame, filling concert halls with fans.[ch. 600] He is also a skilled fencer who uses a shikomizue (a Japanese cane sword) in battle.[citation needed] His reduced weight allows him to jump extraordinarily high and to run across water.[ch. 443, 493] Eventually, he learns how to use his devil fruit ability to leave his skeleton body and explore his surroundings as a disembodied soul.[citation needed]
The idea of a skeleton musician was first conceived by Oda in 2000, about the time of Laboon's introduction and more than half a decade before the first appearance of Brook.[22]
He is voiced by Chō.[23] Ian Sinclair provides his voice in the Funimation English adaptation.[24]

However, his ability does not spare him from diarrhea caused by poisoned food. As a result, he spends about ten hours per day in the bathroom relieving himself.[ch. 528] Second in charge of Impel Down is the exceedingly ambitious Vice Chief Warden Hannyabal (ハンニャバル, Hannyabaru).[ch. 526] He often shows off how tough he is to the prisoners, which earns him admiration among the guards.[ch. 536] However, he cares more about his own position than the security of the prison.[ch. 535] His weapon of choice is a double bladed naginata.[ch. 543] Below Hannyabal stand the Chief Guards Sadie (サディ, Sadi) and Saldeath (サルデス, Sarudesu). Sadie is a very sadistic woman who uses a thin, torturing whip in battle.[ch. 543] Saldeath wields a trident, which also functions as a flute to direct his subordinates, the Blugori, blue, legless creatures resembling gorillas.[ch. 528, 543]

Seven Warlords of the Sea [edit]
The Seven Warlords of the Sea (七武海, Shichibukai), the full title being The Royal Seven Warlords of the Sea (王下七武海, Ōka Shichibukai), are a group of up to seven powerful pirates sanctioned by the World Government who hand over a fraction of their loot to the Government. The Government's idea is to use powerful pirates to fight all the lesser ones. Other pirates consider the Warlords to be "government dogs".[ch. 69] For their allegiance, the World Government pardons these pirates for their crimes and removes bounties from their heads.[ch. 342] The Seven Warlords are loosely based on the European privateers, government endorsed pirates considered heroes in their homeland and pillagers in others.[ch. 260] Initially, the group's members are: Dracule Mihawk, Crocodile, Gecko Moriah, Jimbei, Boa Hancock, Donquixote Doflamingo, and Bartholomew Kuma.[ch. 69, 113, 234, 455, 516] Following the exposure of Baroque Works, Crocodile is replaced by Blackbeard, who soon leaves the group again, along with Jimbei, who resigns to side with Whitebeard against the World Government, and Moriah, who is discarded by the World Government and narrowly escapes an assassination attempt.[ch. 474, 557, 576, 581, 595] The three open spots are eventually filled by Trafalgar Law, Buggy the Clown,[ch. 700] and Edward Weevil[ch. 802]. After Doflamingo's actions in Dressrosa are exposed, Law and Doflamingo are removed by the World Government.
Inhabitants of Skypiea[edit]

With the exception of Gan Fall, most of the inhabitants of Skypiea are shown to have bird-like wings on their back.
Sun Pirates[edit]
The Sun Pirates are a band of pirates consisting of fishmen and mermen, led by Fisher Tiger (フィッシャー・タイガー, Fisshā Taigā), and later by Jimbei. They attack any pirate ship they see, but no matter who is on it, they never kill directly. Their Sun insignia was created to cover up the mark of the Celestial Dragon's slave, "Hoof of the Soaring Dragon", since Tiger Fisher bore the mark from being a slave. But he had escaped the World Nobles and during his escape he freed other mermen/fishmen and Boa Hancock and her two sisters. With the Sun insignia, the World Government was unable to claim the slaves due to mass confusion over whether they were Sun Pirates or not.[ch. 620] Other members include: Arlong, Aladdin, Macro, Choo, Kuroobi and Hatchan. The group eventually disbands when Jimbei joins the Seven Warlords of the Sea.

For betraying Whitebeard's crew, and the murder of his crewmate, he is pursued by Ace who eventually confronts him.[ch. 159, 440f.] After defeating Ace and turning him in to the World Government, he is appointed Crocodile's replacement as one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, a position he promptly abuses to expand his crew with prisoners from Impel Down and resigns once he is finished.

This ability also makes him immune to cutting attacks which will only separate him into parts.[ch. 526f.] Following the Roger Pirates' dissolution, Buggy becomes captain of the Buggy Pirates and achieves limited notoriety as "Buggy the Clown" (道化のバギー, Dōke no Bagī).[ch. 9] Eventually his involvement in the first mass breakout of Impel Down, and the Paramount War, earns him a sizable following of escapees, worldwide infamy as "The Genius Jester" (千両道化, Senryō Dōke), and a seat among the Seven Warlords of the Sea.[ch. 549, 700]

Oda said that Buggy is his favorite antagonist, because of all of them he is the easiest to draw.[42]
Buggy has received much praise and criticism. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network said that Luffy’s fight with Buggy "sets the series' precedent for battles that are simultaneously tense and hilarious".[43] Jacob Hope Chapman of the same site said that seeing Buggy during the Jaya Arc was "entertaining".[44] Bryce Coulter of Mania Entertainment praised Chibi Buggy’s Adventure as one of the best arcs, and Buggy for his "slap-stick humour" and "Voltron-esque combining sequence".[45] He was "disappointed" that Buggy, Smoker, and the Strawhats did not have a conflict at sea.[46] On Luffy and Buggy’s alliance in Impel Down, Chris Beveridge said, "the two do make an amusing pairing as their flight through the first level goes on". He went on to say, "he never really cared for Buggy", but the Impel Down arc turned him into an "engaging character".[47] He said that he believes that Buggy is being set up as a regular character because he was "afraid he might lose him".[48] Pedro Cortes of Japanator said, "Buggy is always good for a laugh, so his bit was a welcomed respite from the oppressive marines beating down Luffy and the Whitebeard pirates."[49]

Reception[edit]
Allen Divers of Anime News Network comments that the male character designs of One Piece are "often quite varied and unique", while the female ones become "a bit repetitive". He also notes that, as the characters are "defined by what they seek", there is little room "for actual development".[65] Todd Douglass, Jr. of DVD Talk simply states that the series' characters have a lot of "charm".[66] His colleague Carl Kimlinger describes the visual style of One Piece as "unconventional" with "grotesquely exaggerated expressions, simple eyes, big mouths and bigger teeth", "supremely ugly supporting characters and skinny, gangly-limbed main cast" and comments that "it's all amazingly distinctive, utterly appropriate, and surprisingly cool—in a goofy kind of way". He also notes that "Funimation's English dub is light-years better than the 4Kids debacle", "unusually accurate, professional, and largely enjoyable, which is far, far more than can be said of the previous dub". He laments that Funimation's version of "Crocodile loses his sepulchral charisma" and that "the original's fine dance on the edge of mawkish sentimentality is disrupted often enough by less-than-stellar acting". He also states that "Colleen Clinkenbeard's Luffy is more a generic spunky kid than a personality in his own right, really coming to life only during the action scenes during which she does a fine job of being darned cool."[67]
Dustin Somner of Blu-ray.com comments that the Japanese and Funimation voice-acting is "fairly good, but not exceptional" and sometimes "overly zany".[68] Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk notes "the daunting cast of characters, both good and bad" as "one of the appealing factors" of the anime, but also comments that "Some of the voices [of the 4Kids dub] were pretty irritating ... with a lot of high-pitches and over exaggerated speech."[69] Brigitte Schönhense of Splashcomics comments that the "brilliant" (German: "genial") flashbacks into the characters' pasts make them so "likeable and lovable" (German: "sympathisch und liebenswert") and that they are the manga's real strength.[70][71] Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that Oda's characters are "whacky" and that his "bizarre" character designs create "wonderful characterizations and personalities". He notes the "well illustrated" facial expressions and says that "it's the whacky characterizations and designs that makes One Piece its own".[72] His colleague Bryce Coulter comments that "One Piece's bizarre character designs will keep your attention as they can be very random and often memorable. Not the prettiest, but it will definitely capture your attention."[9]
