An example of Ibid. citations in use, from "Justice" by Michael J. Sandel.


Ibid. (Latin, short for ibidem, meaning "in the same place") is the term used to provide an endnote, footnote, or bibliography citation or reference for a source that was cited in the preceding note or list item. This is similar in meaning to idem (meaning something that has been mentioned previously; the same), abbreviated Id., which is commonly used in legal citation.[1] To find the ibid. source, one must look at the reference preceding it.
Ibid. may also be used in the Harvard (name-date) system for in-text references where there has been a close previous citation from the same source material.[2][3] The previous reference should be immediately visible, e.g. within the same paragraph or page. Many academic publishers now prefer that "ibid." should not be given in italics, as it is a commonly found term.[4]
Notice that ibid. is an abbreviation where the last two letters of the word are not present; thus, it commonly takes a full stop (period) in both British and American usage.
