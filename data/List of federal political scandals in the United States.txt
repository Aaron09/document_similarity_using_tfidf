Scope and organization of political scandals[edit]
The article is organized by presidential terms and then divided into scandals of the federal executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Members of both parties are listed under the term of the president in office at the time the scandal took place. Persons were either elected or appointed.
Scandal is defined as "loss of or damage to reputation caused by actual or apparent violation of morality or propriety." In politics scandals are kept separate from 'controversies,' (which implies two differing points of view) and 'unpopularity.' Many decisions are controversial, many decisions are unpopular—that alone does not make them scandals.[citation needed]
Breaking the law is a scandal. Misunderstandings, breaches of ethics, unproven crimes or cover-ups may or may not result in inclusion depending on the standing of the accuser, the amount of publicity generated, and the seriousness of the crime, if any. The finding of a court with jurisdiction is the sole method used to determine a violation of law.
Scandals are classified as major or minor, as defined by the public itself and the media's desire to feed that particular frenzy. Thus, small but salacious scandals, can eclipse more serious scandals such as suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus in time of war.
Not included in this article are pervasive systemic scandals, such as the role of money in normal politics, which may purchase access and influence. Neither are 'revolving door' stories, which is the practice of hiring government officials to promote or lobby for companies they were recently paid to regulate. Though some rules now apply, to a great extent this is legal.[citation needed]
Politicians are those who make their living primarily in politics, their staffs and appointees. By definition, political scandals involve politicians. Private citizens should be included only when they are closely linked to elected or appointed politicians such as party officials. This list also does not include crimes that occur outside the politician's tenure unless they specifically stem from acts while they were in office.
Senators and Congressmen who are rebuked, admonished, condemned, suspended, found in contempt, found to have acted improperly, used poor judgement, or were reprimanded by Congress are not included unless the scandal is exceptional or leads to expulsion. However, Presidents who were impeached, but not convicted, are included.
Federal government scandals[edit]
