Baronetage of England (1611–1705)[edit]




Coat of Arms of the Martin baronets of Long Melford (1667) with the badge of a Baronet of England.


King James I created the hereditary Order of Baronets in England on 22 May 1611, for the settlement of Ireland. He offered the dignity to 200 gentlemen of good birth, with a clear estate of ₤1,000 a year, on condition that each one should pay a sum equivalent to three years' pay to 30 soldiers at 8d per day per man (total – £1,095) into the King's Exchequer.
The Baronetage of England comprises all baronetcies created in the Kingdom of England before the Act of Union in 1707. In that year, the Baronetage of England and the Baronetage of Nova Scotia were replaced by the Baronetage of Great Britain.
The extant baronetcies are listed below in order of precedence (i.e. date). All other baronetcies, including extinct, dormant (D), unproven (U), under review (R) or forfeit, are on a separate list of baronetcies.
The baronetcy lists include any peerage titles which are held by the baronet.
To be recognised as a baronet, it is necessary to prove a claim of succession. When this has been done, the name is entered on The Official Roll. This was ordained by Royal Warrant in February 1910.[1] Those who have not so proven are shown below as unproven or under review or dormant. A baronetcy is considered dormant if, five years after the death of the previous incumbent, no heir has come forward to claim it.

Baronetage of Nova Scotia (1625–1706)[edit]




Coat of arms of the Agnew baronets (1629) with the badge of a Baronet of Nova Scotia.


The Baronetage of Nova Scotia was devised in 1624 as a means of settling the plantation of that province. King James VI announced his intention of creating 100 baronets, each of whom was to support six colonists for two years (or pay 2000 marks in lieu thereof) and also to pay 1000 marks to Sir William Alexander, to whom the province had been granted by charter in 1621.[2]
James died before this scheme could be implemented, but it was carried out by his son Charles I, who created the first Scottish baronet on 28 May 1625, covenanting in the creation charter that the baronets of Scotland or of Nova Scotia should never exceed 150, that their heirs apparent should be knighted on coming of age (21), and that no one should receive the honour who had not fulfilled the conditions, viz, paid 3000 marks (£166, 13s. 4d.) towards the plantation of the colony.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] Four years later (17 November 1629) the king wrote to the contractors for baronets, recognising that they had advanced large sums to Sir William Alexander for the plantation on the security of the payments to be made by future baronets, and empowering them to offer a further inducement to applicants; and on the same day he granted to all Nova Scotia baronets the right to wear about their necks, suspended by an orange tawny ribbon, a badge bearing an azure saltire with a crowned inescutcheon of the arms of Scotland and the motto Fax mentis honestae gloria. As the required number, however, could not be completed, Charles announced in 1633 that English and Irish gentlemen might receive the honour, and in 1634 they began to do so. Yet even so, he was only able to create a few more than 120 in all. In 1638 the creation ceased to carry with it the grant of lands in Nova Scotia, and on the union with England (1707) the Scottish creations ceased, English and Scotsmen alike receiving thenceforth Baronetcies of Great Britain.[2]
To be recognised as a Baronet, it is necessary to prove a claim of succession. When this has been done, the name is entered on the Official Roll. This was ordained by Royal Warrant in 1910. Many baronets also hold peerage titles; these have been listed below. The baronetcies below are listed in order of precedence (i.e. date order). For a complete list of all baronetcies, see List of Baronetcies.

Baronetage of Ireland (1619–1800)[edit]
This is a list of extant, dormant, unproven and under review baronetcies in the Baronetage of Ireland. They were first created in 1619, and were replaced by the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1800.
To be recognised as a Baronet, it is necessary to prove a claim of succession. When this has been done, the name is entered on The Official Roll. This was ordained by Royal Warrant in 1910. Those who have not so proven are shown below as unproven or under review or dormant. The baronetcies are listed in order of precedence (i.e. date order).

Baronetage of Great Britain (1707–1800)[edit]
 The below is a list of all extant, dormant, unrecognized, and under review baronetcies in the Baronetage of Great Britain, which replaced the Baronetages of Nova Scotia and of England in 1707. In 1801 it was succeeded by the Baronetage of the United Kingdom.
To be recognized as a Baronet, it is necessary to prove a claim of succession to one previously recognized. Once this has been done, the new Baronet's name is entered on the Official Roll, a procedure laid down by Royal Warrant in 1910. Those who have not proved their claim are shown below as unproven, under review, or dormant.[13]
These baronetcies are listed in order of precedence, which is established by the date of the creation. For a complete list of baronetcies see List of baronetcies.

Baronetage of the United Kingdom (1801–present)[edit]




Coat of arms of the Agnew baronets (1895) with the badge of a Baronet of the United Kingdom.


The Baronetage of the United Kingdom started with the formation of the United Kingdom in 1801, replacing the Baronetage of Great Britain. (For a complete list of baronetcies see List of Baronetcies – which includes extinct baronetcies.)
As ordained by the Royal Warrant in 1910, it is necessary to prove a claim of succession to be recognised as a Baronet and have a name entered on The Official Roll. Those who have not so proven are shown below as unproven, under review or dormant.
The baronetcies are listed below in order of precedence (date order). (For ease in editing, we have created a fresh table every 25 years.)

^ Scotland. Sovereign (1625-1649: Charles I); William Alexander Earl of Stirling; Charles Rogers; Scotland. Sovereign (1567-1625: James VI) (1885). Rogers, Charles, ed. The Earl of Stirling's Register of Royal Letters, Relative to the Affairs of Scotland and Nova Scotia from 1615 to 1635, Volume 1. private circulation. p. xxi. The lands included in the baronies of New Scotland were resigned by Sir William Alexander into the hands of the king [Charles I], who re-granted them to the knights baronets. Thus the lands and titles were obtained directly from the sovereign. Infeftment, it was ruled, should be "expede" at the Castle of Edinburgh. 
^ Turnbull, William, ed. (1839). The Stirling Peerage. Trial of Alexander Humphrys or Alexander, Styling Himself Earl of Stirling. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Blackwood and Sons. pp. 1–2. Before this charter was ratified by the Scots Parliament, his Majesty [James VI] died; when, in 1625, the grant was renewed by his successor [Charles I] in form of a Charter of Novodamus, proceeding upon the above narrative, and conceding, over and above, additional powers to Sir William Alexander. These charters are in the usual form of feudal conveyances employed by the law of Scotland, but erecting Nova Scotia into a Barony, and declaring sasine at the castle of Edinburgh to be equivalent to sasine on the lands themselves. 
^ "Origin of the Baronetage of Scotland and Nova Scotia". The Scottish Journal of Topography, Antiquities, Traditions, &c. &c. Edinburgh, Scotland: Thomas George Stevenson. I (8): 115. October 23, 1847. As such like parties were not baronets of the colonising kind, and yet were desirous, no doubt, to take seisin of their purchased grants in Nova Scotia, old Sir William, always provident, had his remedy prepared. He had had it laid down in the formula of the charter, that "the realm of Nova Scotia, and original infeftment thereof, is holden of the kingdom of Scotland, and forms part of the County of Edinburgh." Argal, to take seisin and instruments of possession "on the Castle Hill of Edinburgh," formed a cure for every difficulty, and served the desired purpose as well as if the baronets had indulged in a trip to the actual site of their new possessions. 
^ "The Baronetage and the New Committee". The Genealogical Magazine. London, U.K.: Elliot Stock. 1: 523. January 1898. The precept for the charter for each Baronet was granted in the name of Sir William Alexander, who surrendered to the Crown the respective portions of his Lordship of Nova Scotia to be attached to the Baronetcy with all rights of regality. The Baronets were allowed to take possession of their territory by deed of infeftment within the walls of Edinburgh Castle. 
^ Laing, David, ed. (1867). Royal Letters, Charters, and Tracts, Relating to the Colonization of New Scotland, and the Institution of the Order of Knight Baronets of Nova Scotia. 1621-1638. Edinburgh, Scotland: G. Robb. p. 126. Had it been exacted ... that each Baronet, with a stated number of colonists, should take personal possession, it is certain the number of applicants would have been scanty indeed. To obviate this difficulty it was held, by a fiction of the law, that the usual legal form of taking possession by an instrument of seisin, or infeftment of lands on the other side of the Atlantic, should take place within the Castle of Edinburgh. 
^ Fraser, Alexander (1922). "Nova Scotia, The Royal Charter of 1621 to Sir William Alexander (address)". Transactions of the Royal Canadian Institute. Toronto, Canada: University of Toronto Press. XIV (1): 14–15, 45. For the purpose of taking possession of his lands after the feudal fashion then prevailing, Nova Scotia was made a part of the county of Edinburgh, and at Edinburgh Castle the ceremony of Sasine was performed. … [excerpt of 1621 charter:] And we will, and grant, and, for ourselves and our successors, do decree and ordain, that one seisin, at this time, by the said Sir William, and his aforesaid, upon any part of the soil of the said lands and province above written, shall, in all time to come, stand, and be a sufficient seisin for the whole region, … 
^ Cooper, John A.; Mowat, J. Gordan (September 1905). "Canada and Edinburgh Castle". The Canadian Magazine. Toronto, Canada: Ontario Publishing Company, Limited. 25 (5): 480. The colony was named New Scotland, and by a legal fiction, it was, for administrative purposes, connected with Edinburgh. In order to raise men to help found the colony, the King instituted the Order of Baronets of Nova Scotia. This hereditary title was given to gentlemen who arranged to send a certain number of men and to pay a certain amount of money to help to found the Plantation of New Scotland, …. The Order was instituted in 1625, the ceremony being held in the courtyard of Edinburgh Castle. By Royal Decree that place was declared to be an integral part of the new colony. This decree has never been annulled. 
^ McGrail, Thomas H. (1940). Sir William Alexander, First Earl of Stirling: A biographical study. Oliver & Boyd. p. 91. To make this possible, since Nova Scotia was so distant, the King declared that sasine could be taken either in the new province or alternatively 'at the castle of Edinburgh as the most eminent and principal place of Scotland.' 
^ MacKay, Janet (November 1993). "Founding of New Scotland (Nova Scotia)". Fifty Plus. St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada: Fifty Plus Outreach Association. 1. Under Scots Law, Baronets "take sasine" by receiving symbolic "earth and stone" on the actual land. Part of Edinburgh Castle was deemed granted to Sir William as part of Nova Scotia. The Baronets were installed with "earth and stone" there while standing in Nova Scotia. 
^ Fraser, Marie. "Baronets of Nova Scotia". Retrieved 2016-03-13. Baronets could receive their patents in Edinburgh rather than London, and an area of Edinburgh Castle was declared Nova Scotian territory for this purpose.
