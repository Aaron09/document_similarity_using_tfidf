The 2017 constituencies showing the final results.


There are 650 constituencies in the United Kingdom, each electing a single Member of Parliament to the House of Commons ordinarily every five years. Voting last took place in all 650 of those constituencies at the United Kingdom general election on 8 June 2017, and these results have been counted and verified.
The election on 8 June 2017 elected 650 constituencies. 317 are held by the Conservative Party, 262 are held by the Labour Party, 35 are held by the Scottish National Party, 12 are held by the Liberal Democrats and 10 are held by the Democratic Unionist Party, with the balance held by various smaller parties, none of which have more than 8 seats, plus four unaffiliated MPs. In addition there is the constituency of the Speaker, which by tradition does not belong to any party.
The number of seats rose from 646 at the 2005 general election after proposals made by the boundary commissions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland were adopted through statutory instruments.[1][2][3][4] Constituencies in Scotland remained unchanged, as the Boundary Commission for Scotland had completed a review just before the 2005 general election.
Primary legislation provides for the independence of the boundary commissions for each of the four parts of the UK; the number of seats for each of the countries; permissible factors to use in departing from any old boundaries; and a strong duty to consult. For the 2013 review this was primarily the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011. The Sainte-LaguÃ« formula method is used to form groups of seats split between the four parts of the United Kingdom and the English Regions (as defined by EU Parliament Elections).[5]
The electorate figures given in the second column of the tables below are those used by the commissions during their reviews. These electorate figures date from the start of the review in each country: England, February 2000;[6] Scotland, June 2001; Wales, December 2002; and Northern Ireland, May 2003. Of the 650 seats listed below, 533 are in England, 59 in Scotland, 40 in Wales and 18 in Northern Ireland.

Summary of fundamental boundary changes for the 2010 general election[edit]

Scotland â No changes from 2005 election.
Wales â Number of seats unchanged: three seats were abolished and three were created: Aberconwy, Arfon, and Dwyfor Meirionnydd.
Northern Ireland â No extra or fewer seats allocated.
England:




North Yorkshire, Hampshire, Warwickshire, Derbyshire, Norfolk, Essex, Lancashire, Northamptonshire and Cornwall gained seats. Isle of Wight maintained its status as one constituency, the largest by electorate.
The City of York was divided into two seats, neither overlapping part of North Yorkshire.
North London, Birmingham and the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Tyne and Wear and South Yorkshire lost a seat each.
Herefordshire and Worcestershire, to reflect their full reinstatement as separate counties, were considered in separate reviews, leading to Herefordshire being split into two simple[clarification needed] constituencies.
Bath, Bristol and Somerset underwent arguably the most significant changes to reflect the abolition of Avon.



Updated electorate figures from December 2010 have been added for the English,[7] Northern Irish,[8] Scottish[9] and Welsh[10] constituencies.
