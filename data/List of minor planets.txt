For unnumbered bodies, see List of unnumbered minor planets





The catalog of minor planets contains more than half a million numbered minor planets, including 134340 Pluto. For an overview, see section index.





Growing number of minor planets since 1995:

     numbered and named minor planets
     numbered but unnamed minor planets
     unnumbered minor planets (not part of this list)






This is a list of numbered minor planets in the Solar System, in numerical order. As of December 2017[ref] there are 746,412 minor planets of which 508,765 are numbered (secured discoveries). Every month, several thousand minor planets are newly numbered and added to this list.[1][2] It is expected that upcoming survey projects such as the LSST will discover 5 million minor planets during the next ten years, a tenfold increase from the current number.[3]
Only 21,191 or approximately 4% of all numbered minor planets are currently named, mostly for people and figures from mythology and fiction.[2] The Jupiter trojan (3708) 1974 FV1 is currently the lowest-numbered unnamed minor planet.[4] Minor planets also include dwarf planets of which 5 have been officially recognized by the IAU with potentially hundreds more to follow in the future.

Partial lists[edit]
The list of minor planets consists of more than 500 partial lists, each containing 1000 minor planets grouped in 10 tables. The data is sourced from the Minor Planet Center (MPC). For an overview of all existing partial lists, see § Main index.

The example above shows the beginning of the first table in partial list 189,001 to 190,000. It has the columns § Designation showing its permanent (number and name) and provisional designation, § Discovery, giving the date and location of its discovery, and column § Discoverers, for people, surveys, programs and observatories that are officially credited with its discovery. In the column "category" an asteroid's membership to a family, group and/or camp is displayed. The catalog table also contains a reference column that externally links to the body's dedicated page at the Minor Planet Center's website and to the corresponding entry in meanings of minor planet names (latter for named minor planets only).
In this example, all 5 bodies were discovered at Palomar Observatory by a trio of astronomers: Cornelis van Houten, Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld and Tom Gehrels. The row's color represents a minor planet's orbital group—cyan is used for Jupiter trojans, while a white, light-grey and dark-grey color is used for asteroids of the inner, middle and outer regions of the asteroid belt, respectively. For more information, see § Orbital groups. As only 189004 Capys has been named yet, the other four bodies only display their number in the permanent designation column. The provisional designation displayed in this example is an uncommon survey designation.





































  LINEAR: 148,677 (29.4%)
  Spacewatch: 139,773 (27.6%)

Top 10 discoverers of minor planets account for nearly 90% of all discoveries (as of November 2017; total of 506,410 numbered bodies; corrected MPC-figures).[5][6]


Discoverers[edit]
For a more comprehensive list, see List of minor planet discoverers.
The MPC credits more than 1000 professional and amateur astronomers as discoverers of minor planets. Many of them have discovered only a few minor planets or even just co-discovered a single one. Moreover, a discoverer does not need to be a human being. There are about 300 programs, surveys and observatories credited as discoverers. Among these, a small group of U.S. programs and surveys actually account for most of all discoveries made so far (see pie chart). As the total of numbered minor planets is growing by the thousands on a monthly basis, all statistical figures are constantly changing. Note that the MPC summarizes the total of discoveries somewhat differently (typically by distinct group of discoverers), for example, bodies discovered in the Palomar–Leiden Survey are directly credited to the trio of astronomers as displayed in the above table.
Designation[edit]
After discovery, minor planets generally receive a provisional designation, e.g. 1989 AC, then a leading sequential number in parenthesis, e.g. (4179) 1989 AC, turning it into a permanent designation (numbered minor planet). Optionally, a name can be given, replacing the provisional part of the designation, e.g. 4179 Toutatis. (Note that on Wikipedia, named minor planets also drop their parenthesis.)
In modern times, a minor planet receives a sequential number only after it has been observed several times over at least 4 oppositions.[7] Minor planets whose orbits are not (yet) precisely known are known by their provisional designation. This rule was not necessarily followed in earlier times, and some bodies received a number but subsequently became lost minor planets. The 2000 recovery of 719 Albert, which had been lost for nearly 89 years, eliminated the last numbered lost asteroid.[8]
Only after a number is assigned is the minor planet eligible to receive a name. Usually the discoverer has up to 10 years to pick a name; many minor planets now remain unnamed. Especially towards the end of the twentieth century, large-scale automated asteroid discovery programs such as LINEAR have increased the pace of discoveries so much that the vast majority of minor planets will most likely never receive names.
For the reasons mentioned above, the sequence of numbers only approximately matches the timeline of discovery. In extreme cases, such as lost minor planets, there may be a considerable mismatch: for instance the high-numbered 69230 Hermes was originally discovered in 1937, but it was a lost until 2003. Only after it was rediscovered could its orbit be established and a number assigned.
Discovery site[edit]
See also: List of observatory codes and List of minor planet discoverers § Discovering dedicated institutions
Observatories, telescopes and surveys that report astrometric observations of small Solar System bodies to the MPC receive a numeric or alphanumeric code such as 675 for the Palomar Observatory, or I41 for the Palomar Transient Factory, a dedicated survey that runs at Palomar Mountain. On numbering, such an observatory may directly be credited by the MPC as discoverer.
Orbital groups[edit]
Further information: List of minor-planet groups and Asteroid family
In this catalog, minor planets are classified into one of 8 orbital groups and highlighted with a distinct color. These are:


  Near-Earth obj.  
  MBA (inner)
  MBA (outer)
  Centaur


  Mars-crosser
  MBA (middle)  
  Jupiter trojan 
  Trans-Neptunian obj.


The vast majority of minor planets are evenly distributed between the inner-, central and outer parts of the asteroid belt, which are separated by the two Kirkwood gaps at 2.5 and 2.82 AU. Nearly 97.5% of all minor planets are main-belt asteroids (MBA), while Jupiter trojans, Mars-crossing and near-Earth asteroids each account for less than 1% of the overall population. Only a small number of centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects have been numbered so far. In the partial lists, table column "category" further refines this principal grouping:

main-belt asteroids show their family membership based on the Hierarchical Clustering Method,[9][10]
near-Earth objects are divided into the Aten (ATE), Amor (AMO), Apollo (APO), and Atira (ATI) group,[a]
Jupiter trojans display whether they belong to the Greek- (L4) or Trojan camp (L5),[11]
trans-Neptunian objects are divided into dynamical subgroups such as cubewanos, scattered disc objects, plutinos and other Neptunian resonances.[12]

The following statistics (classification scheme and data) was adopted from the JPL Small-Body Database.[6][b]

Notes[edit]



^ a b Split-up of NEOs into Amor, Aten, Apollo and Atira asteroid is based on the orbital criteria given in adjunct table. The data is sourced from JPL Small-Body Orbital Elements "Numbered Asteroids (50 MB)" file
^ This table adopts the orbital criteria used by the JPL Small-Body Database, with the exception of (1.) using a different limit to categorize asteroids of the intermediate main belt (i.e. a = 2.5–2.82 AU), and (2.) adding another orbital criteria to outer MBAs (q > 1.666 AU).
The values for an object's perihelion and aphelion need to be derived from the semi-major axis and the eccentricity as they are not provided in the data source (q = a(1-e); Q = a(1+e)).
^ There are a few minor planets that remain unclassified based on the defined orbital criteria. At least five of these bodies have a semi-major axis too large to be an outer main-belt asteroid, and an orbit too eccentric to be classified as a Jupiter trojan (JPL classifies these bodies simply as "asteroids", while the MPC, which never distinguishes between inner, outer and middle MBAs, classifies them as "main-belt asteroids"). Other unclassified minor planets include Mars-crossers (as per MPC) with a semi-major axis of that of an outer-MBA (as per JPL).
